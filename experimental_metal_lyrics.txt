The cold
the fridged heart
that I feel

without doubt
Living in shadows
I can feed
Al this Pain
No releif
Soon the sun
will take me

On the edge of immortality
noone fells the levity
Oh why must it be the sun
and not the moon

It curses me

The cold night
The daylight
My soul flight
Lost all life(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Zombie raiding parties
Run to the hills
You will die
Sleep soundly my child
For death has come
Tonight judgment reigns
Stab them in the back
Chop off their heads
Lick their spines clean
Zombies hunger for human flesh
Crimson skies over the once great metropolis
Now a desolate wasteland
Fiery embers fall onto putrid flesh
Rotting it from the bone
Everyone you've ever known has died and burned away
This is the end of humanity
This is the endDude are you listening to Algion?

Yes.Alabama left, pass her on the right
Small town dances
Suddenly the earth cracks open and the screech is heard
Come on, were going to ride tonight
Keep your baby outta sight
We'll kick her in the dead
She'll come home dead
Metal destroyers
Have come to take your life
Metal destroyers
Riding steel horses
The zombie apocalypse has began
Run and hide
Your life ends tonight
Run for your life(Instrumental)Blinded by a vision 
Trapped in ignorance
Walking dead
The ruins of this world

Stand up now feel the pain
Do something for your miserable life
Wake up now siege the day
Don't waste your life away

In this endless war
There is nothing left to say
Fight for a reason and live for another day
In a state of conformity

Crucify a martyr in the name of truth
Relentlessly devoted to the plan

Stand up now feel the pain
Do something for your miserable life
Wake up now siege the day
Don't waste your time away

In this endless war
There is nothing left to say
Fight for a reason and live for another day

In this endless war
There is nothing we could gain
Fight for a vision and live for some better days
In a state of conformity

A pale light
The essence of our faith
Carved in our hearts

A daybreak
A splendor in the dark
This is maybe
This is maybe our hopeAnakim, Nephilim, Gibborim, Seraphim

By Itay Necrofog Krasilshikov

The guns are loaded
Daggers are at hand
Fire burns in our hearts
Our eyes bleed justice

Severed flesh!

Satan whispers a lullaby under a moonlit sky
Chains swathe your souls to eternity

Severed flesh!

Through dead eyes the blind can see
Through the storm we shall march on
We converse through blood
In silence we strike

No longer shall their reign devour us
Destroy at willSearching for sight beyond what the eyes can see
Reaching in the dark for some kind of tangible
Existential clarity
Into the light of a thousand burning suns times infinity
The revelation that irony is hidden in every catastrophe
And within each moment of every collapsing star (the realization)
That cosmic truth is on the tip of a serpent's tongue
And time is the lie that's spoken through the voice of the blind
Denied the evidence of the soul that cannot be told
Awake within this forever dreaming universe
A dream that turns the spirit into the flesh
Our eyes are wide open but cannot focus
On something so surreal
This is real
It's not a question of truth or deception
We're falling from nothing to nothing then back againThey think they are the superior ones
They think they are above our heads
They read the bible and they kiss the cross
They do a lot of things that makes no sense

They read the bible just to hide from truth
They read the bible so they can sleep at night
They read the bible and dream of paradise
They read the bible and worship Jesus Christ

Stay away from all the Christian shit
Holy men prowls in every corner
Don't be fooled by their disgusting tricks
If they try send them to the coroner

I teach my brothers not to fall in traps
I teach my brothers not to believe their words
I teach my brothers to despise them all
I teach my brothers to hate them all

Worldwide they preach to ambush the weak
Holy legions lie in wait

Hate them

Crush them all with Jesus they bleed
A paradise it would be

Hate them

The strong ones stand tall
The weak ones will fall

They think they are the superior ones
They think they are above our heads
They read the bible and they kiss the cross
They do a lot of things that makes no sense

They read the bible just to hide from truth
They read the bible so they can sleep at night
They read the bible and dream of paradise
They read the bible and worship Jesus Christ

Hate themGone away with the night 
With your last breath scream "genocide" 
They've come to rule, they've come to slay 
They've come to take our world away 
An enemy ten thousand strong 
Can't destroy what we've known so long 
Relentless throne, you don't rule here 
For tonight we show no fear 

Ten days and nights 
Our hearts ignite 
Look in our eyes 
The fire never dies 

Raze to become our king and reign eternally 

Now your greed will do you in 
Succumb to this deadly sin 
Initiate your master plan 
Now you fate is in our hands 
Destiny is on our side 
Mutiny, regicide 
Crownless king, say your prayers 
There's no end to this nightmare 

SOLO: SzemanskiYou know that the fog is here omnipresent
When the diseaser sees no cure
You know that the fog is here omnipresent
When the intents remain obscure
Forevermore!

Weave us of mist
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable wall-less maze
A secular haze!

You know that his son is near omnipotent
When she sees eye to eye with spears
You know that his son is near omnipotent
When youth and innocence disappear
Forever lost!

Weave us of mist 
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable, wall-less maze
A secular haze!

He is divinity omniscient
Seeing the world revolve with spite
The surge of humanity oblivious
To the divine bringingeth light 
Let there be night

Weave us of mist
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Fog weaver!

Come mist eternal
Come mist eternal
Come secular haze.My eyes in your face, staring at the wall. Here is where a grown man becomes a child again. It's just as well you've laid down your burdens, after such a long life. After so many years when you did nothing but consume. Nothing in this world rests easy at night. Your heart slows down, but you're bleeding out faster, drained, an empty sack. The pattern that you are is fragile. The pattern's all you are, and it dissolves. And I am a willing host for anything that's left: one quarter of your blood, the closest you will come to eternal life. And in good time, we'll circle round like crows, an open-mouthed farewell, ripping you apart. Your voice in my throat, your tremors in my arms: the disease of the father forced upon the son. I have finally found a home.(Instrumental)FIRELY BIRD IS GLIDING TOWARDS SUN
LAST FATHER OF HOPE HAS FALLEN ON YOUR THRESHOLD
HIGHEST TIME TO MOVE TO STARS
EMPTY SPACES ARE WAITING FOR YOUR VOICE
ABOVE EARTH, UNDER HEAVEN
BETWEEN CLOUDS - WHERE ECSTASY IS LESDING TIME
WITHOUT HANDS, ON WINGS
IN DIMENSIONS MIDDLE - WHERE FEELING AND DREAMS ARE DEAD
DON'T REGRET FUTURE
DON'T WAIT FOR DAWN
FORGET ABOUT HARMS, PAY OFF DULL DEBT
AND FLY AFTER BIRD, AFTER LIGHT OF SUN
ONLY ONE BIRD IS GLIDING ABOVE YOU
FORGOTTEN FEATHER IS DESTROY YOUR FORCE
EMPTY SPACES WILL PLAY YOUR HYMN
AND SILENCE WILL DIVIDE YOUR LOT FOREVER(Instrumental)Information certainly detained 
Paranoia near omniscient 
Updated files accessorize 
Flow my tears, the policeman said. 

Flow my tears 
Along the platform track, narrow blind line 
Hostage management a formula, for a new kind of lifeless life 

Assimilation seen through 
To an incomplete, a prototype, rote. 
Infocentric time line driven 
Ready? Die.The twin ravens of Odin.
The wrong Magick performed.
Insane rhythms unroll a stairway down to Hell.

The mysteries sing to me in equivocal languages I cannot or won't understand.
Confusion will be my epitaph, of course.
So, the riddle is posed.
The question mark.
Caveats, caveats are groaned.
The whole of the law.
The curated will.
In theory and practice, order is unfamiliar.
The pleasure is mine.
All mine.
But chaos reigns.
And now I am sick.
Sick as a dog.The last wish will remain in their legacy
Chosen for a dreamless gift
The loss you were seeking from my misery
Fading to asleep

Embrace the victim of your soul
You hate it anyway
So hate I

Capture of grace reveals my vanity
Tired for this pressure
Value of freedom it keeps on illusion
Appears as my own 

They hate myself and you
Corruption of infernal
They praise my war

War of my misery

Untiring legion concedes my confession
It would serve no reason
Uninvited, cold personality
Reserved to be untrue for themselves

Embrace the victim...

They hate myself...(Instrumental)I'ts never on the news 
We never see no genocide 
No flowers on the graves 
For the ones that died 
Baptized in blood 
We pray for the weak 
No sign of tomorrow 
The future looks bleak 

Skin like dirt 
Brutally thin 
Fighting a war 
They'll never win 
Stripped of your rights 
Knocked to the ground 
Speak out of turn 
Your bodies never found 

Through actual torture, you're starved to death 
Eagerly awaiting your last breath 
Suffering from disease, inevitable execution 
Destroying a race as if it were pollution 
No sign of tomorrow, no time for repent 
The inevitable slaughter of the innocent 

Watch them die(Instrumental)I wake up at night when the sun still sleeps
Dress up in misguided fantasy
I drive through the mountains in quiet greed
Can't wait to see what my day will bring

Ah what you're doing to me
I can't believe what I see

I'm alive, looking forward to being with you, I'm never satisfied
I can't stay, there's a hole in my heart, now baby don't get lost

I follow my twisted road to the sea
I scan through the fog and the silent mist
The demons in my mind are all but real
I feel like a lion that roars within

Ah what you're doing to me
I can't believe what I see

I'm alive, looking forward to being with you, I'm never satisfied
I can't stay, there's a hole in my heart, now baby don't get lost
Don't get lost

Oh, what's this song I can't sing
And these words I can't speak
Feel I'm trapped in a cage

Those who wander through streets of greed and don't realize the love they miss they shall inherit the hell, and the endless pain, the karmic result of what they've been doing

Absentmindedly squandering your soul you don't keep track of the friends you leave, you shall abide all the worst, and suffer the pain, and you'll be slowly falling into the darkness

Those who spend life in holy passion devoting themselves to common good they shall inherit heaven, and the endless joy that come from sharing their everything from deep inside

Disinterestedly give your love and don't expect anything in return, you shall enjoy all the glee, the delight within, now will I ever be able, so far there was no way(Instrumental)A smoke a fog and a black cloud soaked into
Made of concrete labyrinth`s walls called mystery
And penetrated then through
Easily like finger put into the water
Aiming no target blindly finds its way
The place for the key in the centre of my head
Known to my army and my enemies` forced 
The smell of victory in corridors surrounds me
In the beginning of the battle pointing me the winner

I am
And you are
I am your enemy
And you are mine
You don`t have eyes 
And i stare into a mirror
And i see us both

The key is yours `cause you`re inside
Victory is yours `cause i gave you a hand 
So lick me
Exploit me
Catch me
Fuck me tender- Across Time and Space - 1:5

By the veil of light of deception 
I stand fourth beyond all exception 
By the pale worm the king of seas 
Summon plagues of ancient disease 
Upon this realm i have stood for centuries of chaos
Son of the sun, and lord of the spheres of burning
I did walk among the astral planes in veils of death
And it was known to me of all iniquity and betrayal 
For the Elder ones would rise upon their old fathers 
Would not i speak to them of fate of the Elder ones
For it would be their calling and their destiny of ruling
Yet my father would banish me as i did say nothing

- To Walk with Men - 7:2

Edin na zu!
Was cast upon me
A banishment!
To walk among men
Hear me Father!
I stand in your shadow
No more!
I call to the gates
Nanna!
Father of the Zonei
Hear my pleas!
I as nephew of yours
Beckon you!
Send gates upon me
That i may!
Be free yet once more
A burning disk did strike before me
Within flames a voice of calling
A test to be sent forth upon me
The zones of an ancient are falling
Choosen one!
Freed again once more
A test of life!
To summon thee Uggae 
An ancient curse!
One whom would rebel
Elder fathers!
To destroy the curse

- Fathering of Sorcery - 8:51

In that way you have called upon me father of the sky and spirits of the 
burning disks of light i do praise upon you the blood offerings of man in form 
of sorcery they were well versed and known in ways of cataclysmic whirlwinds of 
force. As you have sent the gates upon me i do ask to be known in ways of these 
tests of my strength and wisdom. To be sent blind as thee who look upon your 
brilliance is unknown in ways of our kind. As i did speak there was a spectre whom 
did become known to me and did speak of teh great elder one Cthulhu whom had slain
thee his elder brother and who did set barriers of entrance upon his realm. I was as 
assasin to slay the great elder one who so has lost his ways.
A veil of light surrounds my soul
Subdue the darkness lest all will fall
Yet free once more..
To the gate i do so cross the realm of all man
I do also flee the realm of men
Before the gates i stand in wait
Open unto me so that i may pass
Unto the realm of the elder ones 
To walk among my kind once more

- Of Dreams and Visions - 4:76

As light in spaces between time
So shall i be in spaces between worlds
Gate of the sun open above me
So that i may embrace my kind once more
Memories of fading visions
Visions of sound..
Upon the realm i stand.. Knelt on astral land
Spirits of the fiery disk.. Burning fires of night
Upon my brow was placed.. A crown of calling
Around my neck placed.. The jewels of Ishtar
Around my waist placed.. The sacred belt of Enki
With haste i shall flee..
Mighty of Cutha turn your face in fear 
Lest i strike a fatal blow upon your brow
With wand of lapis i do entrust visions
For the kingdoms of the Ancient ones
Know that Cthulhu may see me of here
Know that mighty Cthulhu may lye in wait
Know that i do possess in me all power
Know that in me i possess...
A power strong and true!

- Upon the Gates of Ninnghizhidda - 5:9

Sent upon the gate to realms of the dead and the dying
Wherein no inscence does burn and none are dreaming
All formed of impeity and blood offerings of Ancient ones
Know that all shall be avenged in names of the ancients
Cthulhu screamed upon his throne whence he sensed a presence
All of life were pale with fear and hate as dark waters trembled
And Azag-Thoth was awaken from sleep as dark waters boiled
The gates of seven did close and monsters were shaped as guardians
And they were as demons of the abyss and as faceless and terrible
Clung to the gates of seven they do stand guard against those of life
Hearken and beware for they are terrible sights to view and behold
As the horned serpent Ninnghizhidda stands before the gate of seven
Across countless seas i stumble and through many deserts i crawl
Whence before i reach the realm of Cthulhu i may perish yet in haste
Yet i do summon the powers of the water of life and go forth once more
And upon the sky i did see the many eyes of Cthulhu and i did turn pale of fear
Watcher of all worlds
Before my time is done
I plead of you
Ressurection!

- Whirlwind of Spirits - 0:07

To the first gate i pass and with rays of life i subdue the monsterous force
Upon the Second gate i cross and with disks of calling i unlock the forces
Holding the wand of lapis i pass upon the gate of three and render it open
No evil spirit may seize me of here!
Through gates of many i stumble 
Unto the gate of seven with sorcery..
Ninnghizhidda may stand before me
With a baneful howl he rises forth..
With crown of calling i take to skies
With disks of fire i project upon him..
Of no effect are my powers upon him
As with rays of shadows he howls..
By the veil of light of darkness 
I stand forth upon thrones of death 
Upon the gate of pale worm of seas
Wrought with plagues of ancient disease
Hear my words as i swear to you 
The sword of iniquity slices through 
Upon the altars of unlife a fatal sweep 
Such has been the fate of all whom stand upon seas
Raising swords upon the throne of mighty Cthulhu
And this has been my story to tell as i have been asked
For once more a god has fallen to a lord of disease
As i am the one whom knows all that as he sees
Watcher of all and keeper of the keys to the gates 
Such was the fate of this son of an ancient father 
Shall be the fate of all who rise before dark waters 
Stoop not down unto those dark waters less ye perish 
For within lies a deep unyielding ever espousing abyss 
Hiding creatures of malevolence and those evil spirits
Lest ye summon all who would lay waste to your realm
This is how it has been written and it has been learned
Hearken and remember sons of men and race of spirits!
From dark waters a howl comes fourth in black nightWell I'm a no good sickle ridin' son of a whore 
I got a face like a demon and I'm mean as a boar
I ride a one ton hog, and I'll give it the gas
 if you fuck around with me I'll put a boot in your ass 

I bleed gasoline, and I piss alcohol
I got a cobra for a cock and some wrought iron balls
I got your name tattooed and you better believe
I'm gonna cross that sucker out or my name ain't Kreeg.

[background] [I'll cut your fuckin' head off!]

I got poison in my brain, I'm the sultan of pain
I got a piece of paper here that certifies I'm insane
I'm the boss, I'm the king, I'm the A number one
And the cannibals and me are gonna have some fun.

Now I run this town, and I'm nothing but fair
And if you don't agree with me your gonna swing from the square
I got your name tattooed and you better believe
I'm gonna cross that sucker out or my name ain't Kreeg.

[background]  [Come here! you son of a whore!]

[solo]

The leader of the cannibals, his reign is supreme
Violence and chaos, a tyrannical regime
And when they come for you in the final reaping
The last thing your gonna see is Kreeg!

We got our choppers lined up and runnin' it down
We're gonna rain hell on this shithole town
I got your name tattooed and you better believe
I'm gonna cross that sucker out or my name ain't Kreeg.Slam of the door
You can hear behind you
Temporal world
falling to pieces
Dying in mist
Agony came
Dreams are blown by the wind

Ruthless fear
Has devoured flesh
Fist made of steel
Is profaning your face
Fist is law here
The world of exiled souls
Dreams are blown by the wind

Behind the bars
The new day is rising
Braced bodies groan
Kills steals your sleep

In dirty walls
Death is laying its snare
Nobody believes
In freedom but still wants

To escape into his dreams
To escape to last

Not count the days
Times left behind the wall
Whisper of prayers
Coming out from your mouth

Hidden in dreams
The world deprieved of bars
Is dissolving
Going away in dark shade

To escape in world of dreams
To escape to last
Though you dream of freedom(Instrumental)The first eye opens by the sun's warmth to stare at it 
the second eye is ripped open by an apothecary, systems and words 
I only know there may be more because one hurts when I think too much 

The first eye is blind 
there is no other.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I sell my soul
Sitting here in a smoke filled room,
Staring at a blank screen or an empty paper
Waiting the moment of illumination,
To create in dirt and in dust
Being dirty and dusty...
I sell my soul
With every sentence here i growl
I bid my mind
For all is redefined
Expecting the instant of edification,
To originate in mud and grime
Soiled and withered...
I sell my soul
With every sentence here i growl
I bid my mind
For all is redefined
When i get rid of life for a moment
I think of all the beings who are supporting me
Giving me the strength to move forward
To set new goals, to set new aims
And a new chapter to write...
I sell my soul
With every sentence here i growl
I bid my mind
For all is redefined
To emanate in ooze and loam
Sully and moth-eaten
Till the moment of glow and gloryYou lost the reason why to live
Hunched under the burden of blame
Your mind and nonsensicality reproaches
Raped by alien opinion

Run away ahead their look
Needless crippled and killing
Absolute suspence about your life

To much violence and informations
Why to die why to live
Run away ahead their look
Needless crippled and killing(Instrumental)When you come to my world
no one will emplore
The pain and averiss and 
death forevermore

Want to see your life force
draining from your brain
No more serving light an
no more feeling pain

Nothing gives my world 
more pleasure to subdue
Have the lust for vengance
makes me think of you

There's no justice in the
killing of my soul
Crushing everything and
leaving me alone

All must die

I will never love you
I will never die
Cursed you with my pain
and blood will fill the sky

Want to see the light when
darkness fills my day
Want to see the mortals
die and go away

I will tell a story
about the thing I saw
Wonce there was a maid then
blood was on the floor

Noone can resist me
noone can ignore
Must crush everything that
you have ever bore

Nothing is the same now
nothing is so new
Terror is the name when
I have just walked through

Want to see the light when
darkness fills my day
All those counting penance
Make them go away

Wonce their taste was sweet
but now there's nothing more
Feasting on the sentients
turns it into war

Now I see the endless
errors of your way
You think light is life when
shadows rule your days(Instrumental)Time's killing you
It is bringing death to your flesh
Death's waking fear
Fear waking chaos and anger

Sword - in your hand
It's ready to put to death
Blood starts to flow
Waking up are demons of war
Fear waking chaos and anger
An eye for an eye and fists for words
A knife in chest for truth
Angel of death reaping his harvest
Killing the rests of souls
Chaos anarchy murderous colt
No salvation at all
From the aression the anger comes

Time's killing you
Nobody can ever change it
Wrath - revenge call
Kains stigma continues to glowAbandoned population
Twilight contemplation
Eternal irritation
Nocturnus' possession
Enormous hazardous
Lasers QuadThrust
Aeternus: this must
All of this bliss
Without them without us
Rendered inoperable
Syndrome hostile
Desired and unstoppable
Inspired but impossibleAye, laddy! Blowin' things up!Veins full / break down
Escape / hold on
It will / never
End now / die now
Don't take / any thing
That will / be you
Don't take / your soul
All end / all end(Instrumental)Watch me drool. 
Drool over girls 
Racks on racks of magazines covered in girls. 
Girls with their racks barely covered. 
The girl at the register tells me i'm disgusting 

Watch me watch TV. 
Feed me people who are people that I want to be. 
Mold me in the the image of my outdated instincts. 
Tell me its okay to be me. 

She was about as real as Bigfoot, 
about as glossed as the Korean war in a 5th grade history book. 
But I drool all the same when the radio plays, 
and when the internet tells me to wipe my face I nod politely, 
like, share, re-tweet, and keep drooling. I agree with both sides. 
I retreat but I keep talking 

I just wanna be loved. 
I just wanna be sheltered. 
Does any of this ring a bell?(Instrumental)Feel the tectonic shift inside
On dualistic sheets of plain
Litigate the laws of time
Structural order now remains

Inner workings of a time stand to saturate
When information is a lie

Summon power from the sky
re-isolate a point in time
An existential war cry
Forever fields its fate

Inner workings of a time stand to saturate
When information is a lie

Elegant light aligns the spine
Electrifying our disdain
Revitalize
Revise our eyes

Through the concrete haze 
Of infinite space
Molecules co-mingle
With an agile grace

Expect to kneel in front of greed
Pumping hearts that cannot bleed
Hatred rise through siphoned eyes
As souls sucked dry
Our purpose dies

New being emerges
Done with ways of old
Omnipresent
Weave the fabrics of the soul
Displays total control
Penetrates every cell
And we commence to incite
The inventionYou can't fight you can't run, 
We're gonna kill you, it's all for fun 
Start ripping flesh, destroying lives 
You'll find it hard, just to stay alive 
Now it's back to you, at the final stand 
Go before things get out of hand 
Gnarly dudes ripping it to shreds 
Getting low, rising from the dead 

Bite the dust and now you'll see 
We're the scum of society 
You try to survive 
But no one gets out alive 

Starting to see I'm at a dead end 
Full time job in a brainless trend 
Hold me down and watch me choke 
My life's not rad it's a fucking joke 
4-wheeled demons filled with hate 
I'm not evil, I just wanna skate 
Totally out of control 
Over the line in a backyard bowl 

Bite the dust and now you'll see 
We're the scum of society 
You try to survive 
But no one gets out alive 

Death box, get ready to slam 
I'm about to hit the floor like a battering ram 
Too much to do, too little time 
Death to false dudes who can't finish their line 
Plain to me why can't you see 
Shredding ain't easy ask F.M.B 
Go home leave your troubles behind 
Time to play games and get back your mindEvery moment
Every day
Every breath of life

Always counts
Always flies
And never ever dies

Shades of grey
Fade away
Time heals the way

But, you won't find
The star that shines
Unless you're flying high

You will have to fly so high
You can't give up, you have to keep trying

Trinity of love

What is left for
Us to take
Is just an empty glass

Our goal is to fill it up
With sparks of blooming hope

You'll have to fight
You'll have to cry
But in the end you'll find
The key of time
The gold that shines
The greatest gift of life

There's no more blue tomorrow
New life found, no more sorrowMy growing sun is set
My fate has become none
The future has begun to be the past
The time is now nothing for me...

Inside my heart, I feel so lonely
Inside my head, I feel so empty
So tell me why life is so sade, 
Why I'm just dust in the dark?

The rose of my life has faded
So far from your hearts...

Life is an ocean of sadness
Where mind lost itself in illusions
For not to see the truth
And what it means to live...
My hope has run away
My dreams have flown away
So far in the sky
That now, I'm alone in the night.

Blown by the wind like sand
I wander nowhere in this lost land

Life is an ocean of sadness
Where mind lost itself in illusions
For not to see the truth
And what it means to live...

The stars seems so faraway
The darkness invade my way...

Life is an ocean of sadness
Where mind lost itself in illusions
For not to see the truth
And what it means to live...

Solo Romain

Solo FransoisThey say the Devil is alive and well
In Northport, Long Island
A sleepy town turned upside down
By a little Satanic violence
Ricky was the Acid King
A heavy metal fan
Leader of the Knights of the Black Circle
Satan's Left-Hand Man
A bunch of teenage loners
Looking for some thrills
Fucked-up, drug-crazed stoners
On the highway to Hell

Drugs, death and the Devil
A psychedelic sacrifice
For the love of Satan
Someone had to pay the price
They took him down to the killing ground
Where no one could hear his cries
Screaming for his mama
While Ricky tore out his eyes

Say you love Satan
All the drugs you've taken
Were a sacrament in his name
Say you love Satan
Claim him as your savior
Let yourself go insane

Ricky was the Acid King
He said that he could do anything
In a prison cell between heaven and Hell
He made the angels sing
Drugs, death and the Devil
You will never understand
A psychedelic sacrifice
Because Satan is my main man!

Say you love Satan
All the drugs you've taken
Were a sacrament in his name
Say you love Satan
Claim him as your savior
Let yourself go insaneThe Morningstar burns up the dusk
Its torch sheds light on pallid greys
Flakes of snow drifting liquid frantic
Moon drowning in spilled blackness
Poured from wounded skies

The dust of fallen stars still glints
Within the empty void of silent woods
Star-light slices seeping wounds
Through midnight's muddy flesh
Eyes open wide, paleness glowing bright

Inhale the night -
Inhale the breath of night!

Chorus:
Hail the Morningstar -
Bringer of the Light!
Praised be the Blood -
Blessed, liquid Life!
To inhale the night
Eyes are open wide -
Embracing failing, dying light!(Instrumental)Taken away, something our eyes have seen
he's gone off from our reach
all words I can say won't bring him back he's gone
devilish grin, painted on faces again

Cannot get out of his light
Cannot get out of his light

Suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering...

Back to the home, to find the home, where we belong, that stay

Gone home.
Gone away to what we call home
Be or guide, on every step we take
Be or lesson, on every mistake we make

Cannot get out of his light
Cannot get out of his light

Suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering...

He's gone to home, to where we belong...
Gone to home, where we belong(Instrumental)(Instrumental)("Captain's log:

Fragments of time swirling and twisting, sublime ramparts of existing scenes 
Played out before my eyes then torn from my sight shrieking screams, 
illuminating thoughts and dreams 

As reality peels away 
I no longer know this place or date 
Entering a world lost to humanity 
Dwelling in my own absurdity. 

Listen to my insanity 
Grand delusions of actuality 
Let me place this fear in you 
So you feel the pain I go through 

Haunted every minute not knowing if I'm alive, inescapable despair and pleasure through cataclysmic fears 

Haunted every minute not knowing if I'm alive, inescapable despair and pleasure through cataclysmic fears 

Here I experience love and hate 
Each door I open changes my fate 
Emotionally distraught ending ties with your lot. 
Envying your existence. 
Lost in my partitions. 

Fantastic visions, terrifying aural transmissions 
A voice that soothes my wounds, 
Surging through me, it cracks and booms 
Destroying myself on every plane 
As I eat my own shameMy heart is doomed to slavery
My heart has got no bravery
I love this kind of hecstasy
Cause I am doomed to slavery

I cannot run away
My heart asks me to stay
I live in your eyes
Without you my soul dies

My heart is doomed to slavery
My heart has got no bravery
I love this kind of hecstasy
Cause I am doomed to slavery

They say I am crazy
I don't know what I do
Cause in the darkness
A flower doesn't grow

You hypnotize me
I can't be free
He is he player
He's your soul slayer

My heart is doomed to slavery
My heart has got no bravery
I love this kind of hecstasy
Cause I am doomed to slavery(Instrumental)Can you see you're sailing blind
To shores without heart
Till your life will reminds you
Another man's life
You lost your sea lane
'Cause fighting the winds
Let your soul go with the flow
Where destiny waits

Don't waste your trip through this sea
Find the meaning of
Life and remember that time
Is not endless

Fight for your dream!
It could take a long long time
Hard more then it seems

Your soul's destination
Find your bravest dreamed and pursue it

I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long...
Tonight, we could be as one tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

And now the battle's just begun
So many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
As brothers, mothers, fathers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long...
Tonight, we could be as one tonight

Wipe those tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Here I come...

So it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction, and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

that joy was raped by reality
brought that narcotic depency
to the endless apathy

Missed, but forgotten
is me, in the past
that time is now coming
to an end

I had hope
I had something to wish
I had dreams
but that was the past

I, the holder of sorrow
I, no longer in control
I, now so hollow
I, the purest form of misery

Silence turns into a song
a song to glory the dead
that reaches so far
so far, that everyone can hear

Sender, of the Hatred
(Blood killed the fire)

Victim, of all damnation
You make me stronger, your death won't be in vain.
Bleeding, on your creation.
As I grow stronger, as contradictions fade.
The wrath that you create.
As contradictions fade, it's wrath that you create.

Yeah, here comes the rain,
right down again,
it never ends.

Time's come, for you to face your demons now
face the truth.
Never before have you felt, so alone.
No it's too late for you to feel the guilt that you never felt.
Now it's too late, time has come to take back life.

.... and time has come to collect.

Time's come, it's time to pay for all of the damage done.
Never before have we felt so alone.
Now it's too late for you to fall on your knees and beg remorse.
Now it's too late, we have come to take your life.

Yeah, have I gone insane?
I'm a broken man, with empty handsI woke up this morning
I thought it was gone
My eyes were so faithful
And looking for love

It started to recall me
To dig deep inside
I'm loosing control now
It is coming back

A dark day hides in silence
Behind Its worn out curtains
The reason of my dreams
The Absence of my fears
The sky is crying with me
Flooding all my feelings
How wonderful is there
So far to understand

What have I done? I can't remember when it did start
Where am I now? My eyes are blinded by my past
Is this undone? I keep lying myself with faith
When it will be gone? Sometimes it's better to don't say

And it's so cruel to keep inside
So deep so real to leave behind
And it's so hard to take your hand and don't hide
There is no need to make me sane
I am the one who feels the pain
I guess I don't want to be saved from my life

There is no need to make me sane
I am the one who feels the pain
I guess I don't want to be saved from my life

It started to recall me
To dig deep inside
I'm loosing control now
It is coming backThe slithering, squealing & squirming
You are the snake dropping dimes
You seek vengeance but vengeance is mine
You've learned by watching the ways of the rat
And practice the art of knife in back

You seek every open opportunity
To inject your venom
But you never sink in your teeth
You don't have what it takes to strike like a snake
Rats get devoured when rats take the bait

You pick and you pry, droppin' names, droppin' lies
Outrageous stories, empty excuses & rabid alibis
A sometimes person who keeps swtichin' sides
You should remember to cover your tracks
A lil' better next time you try to hide

Quietly you creep, diseased nibbling teeth
In order to catch the rat you must
Set the trap with left over
Rumors, ego, and scraps

Squealin', squirmin', you are the snake droppin' dimes
You seek vengeance but vengeance is mine
You've learned by watching the ways of the rat
Practice the art of knife in back

So you ruin everything you could never be
You avoid and ignore
The fact that you are a rat doesn't
Annoy you anymore
The spring... it snaps
The trap crushes down upon
The back of the ratOur peace
is now in pieces
But what else would
you expect
But we're nothing
Nothing in truth

Here comes
The internal
Winter
Where innocence forgetsFloating on a sea of false fears,
I've grown weary.
Eternal life before and behind me,
I am at my wits end.
I must express to all that will listen,
the things that I have seen.
All things once hidden are plain to the eye,
the ear, the heart, the mind.
And if I take, in my infinite life
the initiative to see
and record all around and within I may
one day fall off the plane of existence
and rest my weary eyes.
My tale starts now.
The stars gape incessantly,
the orbs scream loudly and give me no rest
when in my stupor I see from afar
a creature drifting through space,
a brother.
Long of limb, brings peace to me.
The one come from the tree of creation.
I am obsessed with his existence,
I begin the chase.
Fear grips my heart as I look ahead,
and a sphere grows large in the distance,
I push away and I watch him fall,
his death brings a world new life.
And I think to myself,
"how can life be so fulfilling
when death that strikes so swiftly
can be such a perfect relief?"
From where I stand among the,
stars I see the growth of,
creatures reaching outwards,
past the borders of reason,
that holds them from the void.
They turn their faces towards the sky.
So I observe their every word,
and long to see what they can accomplish
with bated breath, and a hopeful heart
as to the fate of this planet,
my adopted love.
The years pass like moments with change monumental.
My lack of death forgotten for now,
these creatures born in the wake of death grow strong.
Astounded by their drive,
stunned by their pride.
These people of dirt and bone rise high.
With hearts unsoiled and eyes unshrouded,
they look to the sky and long for more.
No god nor boundary can check their rise,
these perfect children of men issue forth.(Instrumental)Uh huh Oh  Oh I like it Auh Yeah yeaah Auh
Here we are, here we stand
Face to face with a band
Heart in hand together 'till the end

far, too many kids
always, poking fun at him
but now, with his new power
they'll get, what's coming to them
their one, just reward
broken bones and lacerations
they'll learn to leave him alone

Screaming up at the sun
Covered in filth

You, the bright, shining light in a blue sky
Tears for you are tears of joy
You won't ever die

(Running down the line
She would beg for water
Without a tongue
Blood flowing like a river from her open mouth)

Marcus: Who is this, that flies away so fast?
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me
If I do wake, some planet strike me down
Why dost not speak to me?

You were there, lifeless stare
Turning lead white, so serene
Snap your neck
Dead in the cold light is how you came to the garden

You won't ever leave
Bled 'til noon, raped and torn
But this is the last day
Oh, goodbye, shut your eyes
Turn your head away
You died right here in the garden
I killed you with my own handsMy fingers are the artist's brushes
With cold bones and bloddy nails
Ten angels ok knowledge and art
Guides for malevolent trails

Crush my joints and cut my skin
Force my hands to pray
My life is a brick wall on the front of you
Full of heretic years and days

But now my pieces are joined as one
United with the whitest bride
I burn my selfish destinations
And never will this stream of rays run dry

The unification of ten elements
The alliance to gather the wild and the wise
Forget your days of joy and disgrace
Supress the laughter and their criesBombraid on the quiet city,
Abnormal people extermination

Streets become hells blood and fire
Savage genocide of innocent people
(x2)

War consequences
(x2)

WAR!

Sniper, hidden behind town walls ruins,
Slaughter, is carrying death and agony,
Sniper just shoot, by another :
Politics is stiring the hate of enemy

Bombraid on quiet city,
Abnormal peolple extermination
Streets become hells blood and fire

Savage genocide of innocent people

War consequences

WAR!

Child bodies, explode on the landmines,
Many civils, brutally killed by riffles,
Poor women, just survivors ready to be raped,
Torture, hardly pain, death is a delivrance.(Eklundh)

Hey, I like the colour of your skin
Hey, I like the teeth you're wearin'
You look so good in those mellow lips
And those remade hips
Hey, I see you've got a brand new nose
And the silicone that you expose
Goes so well with your extended hair
And the eyebrows you wear 

Are you for real ? Are you for real ?
How do you feel ? Are you for real ? 

Hey, I like the words your mouth can say
And the attitude you got today
Gee, the way you've learned to move
You're much improved 

Hey, I see you got new fingernails
Great looks, never fails
You're almost sincere when you start to squeal
Miss sex appeal 

Are you for real ? Are you for real ?
How do you feel ? Are you for real ? 

What's the smell ? There's something dead in here
Something rotten that won't disappear
I'm so sorry, I don't mean to be unkind
But it's your MIND 

Are you for real ? Are you for real ?
How do you feel ? Are you for real ?Divine justice
Redressing all the wrongs
That have been done towards us
Divine justice

Night after night
I've prayed to the lord
And asked of him
Divine retribution

Rumours slander
Badmouthing through the years
But now time's up

Everything is there
In the scrolls of heaven
Every foul intent
In letters of bile

Payback
Screaming from the sky
Sudden death
Imminent torment

Old insurance claims
All paid in full
Lifelong extensions
Of credits in town

(Chorus)

No more casual visits
From curious neighbours
Only there to pay
A reign of fear will spread
Protecting our lands

You know I've told you
This day will come
Everyone for miles around
Will fear our family
One by one will fall down
In our path
Lenience is no more
Let it out
Watch our wrath

(Chorus)(Instrumental)Ambitious horrors fill
Unspoken dimensions
Lords of the absolute
Requiem of abyssic notes

Visions of sorrows untold
Penetrate the mind's I
Floating in torment
Like drugs of the infinite

Multidimensional pain
Screams of the insane
Chambers of nightmares
Frozen inhumanity

Living reality
In sci-fi blackness
Vacuumed oblivion
Abnegation of interior peace
Downfall of reason
Lost mind's perception
Convulsions of the soul
Roaming blasphemies

A dream sucked
Into the vulva of oblivion
Spat back
Into a planet of worms

Atoms storms crystallize
The primordial fears
Buried underneath a castle
Of petrified rifled tears
Wars of android planets
Shape the seeds of cosmic turmoil
Revolution of stars
Rotten space shelters the vision

Anesthesia of populations
Whose features are lost
In the abyss of time
Obliterating the balance
Virtual perdition of concrete proportions
Rage of molecular spawn
Blowing meteors of insanity
Infinite black holes of no-return
Trespassing the corridors of nothingnessSlam Champion is summoned to introduce you to solid ground 
Once you see, then you'll know 
Fear within you starts to grow 
On a knee, exhale slow 
The blade pressed against your throat 
Eye of death, peering in 
Holy journey to begin(Instrumental)Wake up from your hollow sleep, it's already dark
For how long it's been like this?
There's no way out, so it seems
Lost all words to describe this feeling
but still you hope for someone will
understand your lonely agony and connect to you

Locked away you see this world
through alcohol poisoned obscurity
Locked away you see this world
now that it is come to this
All the things you ever wanted,
you know by now it's all vain
And the people that you cared for,
they're not with you in the end

Long winter's gone,
But you're too tired to carry on
Still searching warmth...

Behind those doors
just empty haunted rooms
And in the streets
there's only shadows to see
Blank faces stareI Seek Myself
Woe
I Seek Myself(Instrumental)Good genius
Offering itself in flickers
Everywhere fragile flashes
Wormholes into an unconceived future

Sun of Sun of Sun
Sun of Sun of Sun

Beads of acid
Bedfeathers flying
Through dried up gashes of air

Indices of the moment
When nature's necklace was clipped
And her pearls sprayed everywhere

Sun of Sun of SunI am alone and I am empty 
Life is not my brother anymore 
There is no light of hope 
There is no life, just the darkness 

I am alone and I am free 
Terrible road is my sweet suffering 
When I wept on me 
I not now 
I am nobody 

Let me die in peace, slowly. 
I will to leave my secrets, my mysteries 
My mysteriesWhosoever would offer sustenance, I come as a beggar before you. Some are called to the table who bring wine, fruit, or tender flesh - a feast for kings. There are those of us who come with only hunger. We'll starve to death unless we learn to sing. A fool before your court, groveling in the dirt for every meal. Hold me down at the right moment. Nobody comes when I call. This cruelty is necessary - no one else will ever see, no one else will ever know. No one else will ever know what the truth is. Now see what you've done? Now see what you've done? Tasted of my flesh. I'm in the circle now, and everything is connected: my bones inside your skin. As daylight's child, I was strong. Here, every night, I'm dead on my back. Though everything's the same, and you'll never hear my words, I'm closer to you now than I've ever been. Some are called to the table out of need. Some of us would have been happier alone. Are you now unready, or unwilling, to eat the harvest you have sown? If I return to you with a cover on my eyes, treat me gently. And though I seem a beggar in disguise, let me in, and let me have my fill. If I come as a wolf before your door, make me welcome. But afterwards, if once you turn away, as if you never saw me - I swear you never will.The winters chill entangles the limbs of nature
Dreams of the dead are buried beneath the snow
Fires of raging war no longer burns
A rotting stench spreads over dying fields

Empty ruins reflects the memories of those who were
The bomb raids have turned this land into a burial ground
The body piles are full of soldiers without any honor
And the blood from the innocent continues to flow

A wasted world
Is all that's left
After the war

Mankind
Is forgotten
After the war

Oceans of radiation, unleash eternal winter
Frozen to the core, the heart no longer beats
Struggling to the end with an immortal foe
Life takes the hand of death and vanish from this worldThis is my life
And this is my friend
And I won't give up
Well not 'til the end

These are our fears
So hold out your hand
But I'm not sure here
What is the plan

All at once I see the truth is all around
I won't see me letting go of everything we've found

This is our life
And these are our days
And I love this air
That we both haven't saved

So these are our fears
Just keep them inside
We won't give in
And we will not die

All at once I see the truth is all around
I won't see me letting go of everything we've found

This is my life
And you are my friend
And we won't give up
Well not 'til the end

So these are our fears
Just keep them inside
We won't give in
And we will not die
We will not die

These are our fears
So hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand...CRY. THIS GRAY MORNING -
THEY FOUND A THOUSAND GOOD MEN HERE.
YOU ARE NOTHING. NOT EVEN A NAME.
WE THROW THE LIGHT
OF YOUR DEATH TO THE SKY.

(SHOULD WE GO DOWN. OUT OF YOUR LIVES.
BITING UPON OUR TONGUES:
BUILD US A VILLAGE IN PRAISE.
AND NEVER FORGET HOW WE LIVED.)

VIOLET SHADOWS THE GROUND.
YESTERDAY WAS THE BURNING DAY.
GRIEF IS THE HAMMER OF GOD.
SOFT LIGHT SHOULD HAVE ENVELOPED YOU.
SUCK IN THE BURNING AIR.
DRY AND SEARING YOUR TONGUE.
FALL AND BECOME ONE.
ONE OF THE SHADES OF DAWN.

(WE HAVE LEARNED TO OFFER THE LIGHT.)

SKIN LIKE CANDLES RED.
MELTING BEFORE YOUR EYES.
SEVER THE SEED FROM HOPE.
DYING FOR THE LACK OF WINGS.

(OH, LOVE WE'LL FLY AWAY.
SWEET AIR BENEATH US.
SURE, IT'S TRUE - WE ARE GHOSTS OF HELL.
SHORN OF FLESH. BUT I THINK I SEE THE SUN.
FAR AWAY COLD NOW.
IN THE GARDEN OF DELIGHTS.
WHERE ARE WE NOW, IF NOT DEAD?)

GIVE US NO DREAMS BUT FOR THIS:
ONE SHALLOW GRAVE FILLED WITH
OUR BROTHERS AND SONS.
WITH SLIT THROATS. ON BROKEN KNEES.
WHISPERING PRAYERS.Why should we proud to take
a direction we know it is not for mankind?
To astray we shall be
Why should we glorify the Hades and the death? 
Those things are not the same
Completely lost their power

Too many aspects in this life will hurt us all
In control of sin, evil hides inside us
All our pain is real, darkness seems to be our nature
Easy to hate, but please open your eyes and see

The devil is defeated, darkness has lost its power
Fire and brimstone will torment him eternally
Death is overcome and never to rise again
What a waste of time to glorify his existence!

Jesus Christ shed his blood, took the sin of mankind
He provides us a way to attain life in eternity

Take the time to learn from the knowledge of the truth
Darkness will rise no more, it is reality(Instrumental)Traverse thousands of light years through interstellar space

Funk, what the funk were you thinking?
You funking dumbfunk
Get the funk out of here
We don't want your funking shit...The dreams are upon me again with impossible seas filled to the brim with equally impossible things with preposterous amounts of teeth
Hereto I command an immortal ship and all ten hands on deck
Standing abreast with the finest men, each thick headed and hell bent on seeing this through for reasons all their own
Patching the sails with the shirts off their back,  I need not sail alone the highest crests will fall like the rest under our battered hull
The beast filled troughs our bow will cross atop their cartilage skulls
The chill of the wind carries the hymn of things sounding disappointingly human
I'm quick to remind my men to ignore these beauties with green skin
A sure sign their blood is too thin, singing lampreys that will suck you dry
This sea has no end
Each of you will give in
Only a matter of time before I bring you all bliss01 - Stench Of Rot, Regret & Loneliness:

this cursed life
i plead for joy
diminishing hope
altered reality

To find joy
where it does not exist

The worship
the whore
the pain
the rapid movements
the dead conversations
what does this all mean

execution, destroy this brain
clean up the visions
set me free
from this torturous world

death exists 
in every second the world turns

stench of rot
regret, and loneliness
every second i breathe
is a burden

searching for life
searching for peace
for the better existence
a world without pain
a world of solitudeOhhhhh 

 Bloody hands, my sin 
 Fire, to forget 
 Now, depravity 
 The lord of weak 
 Perfection, no crime 
 Blind, as if I was 
 The end of hope 

 Ohhhhh 
 Depravity inception 

 Leave no trace 
 Leave no hollow 
 Lord of disease 
 Rape with fire 

 Loooooordddd 
 Life is grey as heaven 
 Loooooordddd 
 Life is cold as iceOpen the urchin and peel back the layers
Before the crows come... Pecking, pecking
Flies have infested my skull and the buzzing never ceases
Pecking they come pecking and digging
Before the man in blue may open your skull

Like soldiers they fly in formation...
Onward into battle lest one who stayed behind
To freeze in the barren white fields
But release these straps sir
I am free to fly and I have many miles to go
To fly or flutter I must get out.

In this skin I am unclean...
Peel it from me so I may reveal myself
Shall I peel it from myself then?
Inside I am disgusting and unclean
But it needs to be seen...
There is a monster in here
Summon the wolves to clean my bones

I crave sleep...Sleep without dreams
Pecking... Pecking and digging they come
Searching for the worms...
My head is full of dirt and the worms may feast
In my skin I am filthy, disgusting, dirty and diseased
Please release these straps sir...

I've found a way out...
The smallest crack in the wall
It's free and bright and light seeps through like fire
The smallest crack in the wall in much to small

I check under bed and behind for you
I can head you breathing in my ear
Telling me things... How to fit through
The smallest crack in the wall

Open the urchin and peel back the layers
Summon the wolves...
I slice and slice... Peeling off skin
It's the only way I can fit...
the only way out is in...(Instrumental)Life, living, lie
things beyond me
things that make me feel so sad and morbid
thoughts away from any atmosphere
trapped inside me
I follow my life... I lied again
All this briefly in an abstract senseI have never understood the art of predisposing against me
I consider it a great honor
I feel no curiousity

(After all) It is a distinction one must have earned
The overestimation, the predilection for pity is not something new
I accept no one,
I denounce you all

This does not discourage...
This does not keep my eyes from being open
(But...)
What else is this?
If not the end of my humanity?
What else could this be?
If not a recipe for my...decadence?(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Pierced by my spear of destiny,
my heart is riped and torn
My fury is now ending
and my life's fire is dying embers
Lying dead on the field of battle
I dream of purest life, of time where I am
Free
And where my will is my own
I now journey to beyond the stars
From where I once came
None shall know my passion
that drove me to my death
None shall know my dream
of what once was to be again
I now leave this existence
and leave this place to mindless fools
I did not belong here
My tim is somewhere else
Under the sign of the wolf's eye
I came to meet this end
I have died a warrior's death
With christian blood on my hands
From a world that is not mine
I shall go, never to returnI am before all Gods
I am before all days
I am before all men and legend of men
I am before all kings

No man may seek my resting place
No man may see the shadow out of time
No man may know the vanquisher of death

I am the power and the knowledge
I am the master of magicians
I am the ancient of days
I am the Abhorrence

I receive the sun at night and the moon by day
I send the prayers of the ensnarers, the liers-in-wait
Before me was made nothing that was made

Blind fiends of Chaos are servants on their knees
Most ancient evil dies when I still exist
Wolves carry my name in their midnight speeches
I am the Abyss and Abyss is me, I am the great mystery

Subtle voice is summoning you from afar
Beware, the word is done, you have no choice
Let me and the wanderers of the Wastes
Reign again, destroy the gate

I am before all Gods
I am before all men
I am before all days
I am the AbhorrenceDepleted uranium in chrome and snow 
The cutting edge is bleeding 

Concertina like clipper chips 
Trash your soul till it's no more 

Thrown by arthritis appended with obsolescence 
Just don't fall down the rabbit hole to hell 
Another crack in the cataracts 
So brilliantly dull 
It's just a white out(Instrumental)We all came down to Delhi
To play freaky music 
And check it out
The vivid scenery

This Danish paper printed
Explosive carton
The muslim world
Took quite seriously

Provocation
Or freedom of speech
The shit had hit the fan
And there we were

Don't go out there
You're oozing scandinavian
Just trust the wisdom 
Of your local choffer

Tandoori stains
And teargas jazz
No we're not Danes
Teargas Jazz

As pragmatic vikings 
We kept a low profile
The mad were mad 
as only mad can be

We all came down to Delhi
To play freaky music 
And check it out
The vivid scenery

Tandoori stains
And teargas jazz
No we're not Danes
Teargas JazzProvisioning drain 
Circuitry of extraction 
Trapped in cancer 
Obsessed illusion 

Rapacity of carnage exceeds tolerance 
Thoughtless abuse practiced rape 
Supervised extraction suits voracious interests 
That sap the blood from the Earth's heart 

The spine of a prolonged delusion 
We are controlled by unseen terrorThere are only seven millions of them
But already they are irritating this world
They need to be stopped before they grow strong
A world without knockers and one problem is gone

Door to door they walk and walk
Spreading their disease

They use their mouths as a weapon they shoot us with lies
They wont take no for an answer convert us they must
They will never leave if we invite them in
We must stand up for ourselves when the will say

We are the future no world without us
Live by our books and live among us
Reject what they preach their word is a hoax

The earth will never be the paradise they seek
Thousand years won't come and they will never live on

I know what I am supposed to do
I don't need them to guide me through
I have my own god
So fuck you Jehovah go away

Door to door they walk and walk
Spreading their disease

They look down on me because I disagree
I hate them for that I am their enemy
Death is what I wish for them
And their cult just a distant memory

They are no future so live as you want
Tell them to shut up or smash their face in
Reject what they preach their word is a hoax

I despise them they make me sick
I want them dead

Die they will die they must die
Die they will die they must die(Instrumental)You are the past half empty you stand soon all alone
The old ones dies kids are not forced to go
Empty church teardown the walls
Satan rise to dominate

The time is now
Dominate
Lambs of God
Terminate

For you it's not the way it used to be
The lack of respect grows as you can see
You will always feed your searching kind
But your parish has gone from big to small

You took them early you forced them to believe
No other choice you gave them
But now it's different don't need your Jesus
And Satan knows it

You are the past half empty you stand soon all alone
The old ones dies kids are not forced to go
Empty church teardown the walls
Satan rise to dominate

The time is now
Dominate
Lambs of God
Terminate

For you it's not the way it used to be
The lack of respect grows as you can see
You will always feed your searching kind
But your parish has gone from big to small

Die the holy church will die empty and no one to fool
Die you fucking holy priest soon no church to hide behind
Die you fucking cross kissers kiss that cross goodbye
Die you fucking Christ lovers dead and will not rise
Rise we all know that he will rise to dominate
Rise to dominate lead control rule
Dominate rise to dominate Satan god of godsLong ago they came, outlaws against his name
Oppressing the weak, corrupting the law
Turning this place into a ghost town
Lucifer and his gang have built an empire here

He came from above, traveling through another dimension
This sacred child, is the one they always feared
Ruler of the universe, son of God and king of kings
His name is legend, he came for our salvation

There was a showdown! you can run from the law!
But you cannot hide, retribution will come!
You thought he was dead, but he will return
He took the keys of death and hell then he rose from the dead

He left his ghost to guide the way, 
Promising to return someday
The legend says he will come back 
Upon a white horse to settle the score

Believe in his name to escapes the fires of hell!The first step is taken. There is no way back.
Finally, I walk my sacred and desired path
INTO THE GRIMNESS

Breathe...
Liberate your mind
In this absence of light,
Freeze your life in this night,
Join the eternal darkness.

Scream!
The misanthropic scream is descending,
The air is bleeding,
You can end all the nightmares,
Take a step in the void, kill yourself!

Loneliness without salvation,
An abandoned creature with damned soul,
Self-hatred is the path to afterlife,
Let silence consume you, lay in black!

Cold moon cries at the edge of night,
Razorblades are calling you to unite.
Satisfy the will of your heart,
Take your last breath and go to the other side.

Loneliness without salvation,
An abandoned creature with damned soul...

Sleep...
Now, time is your prison,
The outer world has nothing to offer.
You can fall with the enigmatic rain of the dead,
You can join the abyss that you have always dreamed about...

Now, you are not alone.
Now, your soul belongs to Death. Enjoy the Darkness.Necroscope
I can see to the other side
I can feel the dying sign
it's a vision that brings the vacant light to surface
 
Sovereign of apocryphal dimensions
Liberate the spirits of doom
 
Necroscope
my one precious telescope
a navigator to the opposite edge
a silver dimension that drives everything in space
 
Sovereign of apocryphal dimensions
Liberate the spirits of doom
 
A sudden death is always like a sudden kiss
the smell of rotting flesh will always be there
 
I see the Hand to approaching in my eye
I consider the truth is an absent vibe
Like a blind man that can see the blaze
I follow the destiny into my own haze
 
Far away, they are dying
I stand and watch
Far away from the light
the sudden birth
Far away, they are dying
A sonic chaos
Far away from the light
a divine watcher, architect of life
 
Necroscope,
The only guide to the unknown
A tool to watch the source of god
an instrument of the devil's shore
 
I see the Hand to approaching in my eye
I consider the truth is an absent vibe
 
Descent, human act - 
A Sinful watcher
Confess the sins 
Symmetric fact
Stairs to the unknown
 
Absence of mankind
A healing tool 
Swear to the top 
like a sick of faithI've looked under the bed 
 and behind the cupboard 

 I've torn off the wallpaper 
 and all of the floorboards 

 but I still haven't found you 
 yet I know that you're there 

 I hear your murmurs at nightWhen I heard ideas igniting in my head,
Thoughts of defraction and change,
My reaction to the crashing of this machine,
Was one of chaos - to disconnect the plug

Powerplant - give me the eye to see the other side.
The see the technicolours of my dreams.
Powerplant - give me the eye, give me the power
Give me the power of my dreams

Doors of perception ore banging in the wind.
echoing through the corridors of the mind.
Khock-knock - it's only me
(I'm coming around again)
Are you still working out the game?

Powerplant - give me the eye to see the other side.
The see the technicolours of my dreams.
Powerplant - give me the eye, give me the power

Give me the power of my dreams
Can you hear those doors Otazka
Are they mine or yours?
Can you hear those doors Otazka
The Door swings both ways!

...this is the end.Departing the orbiting Frigate Orpheon with much haste and fervor, 
 Dispossessed and weary. Incredulous. Precarious. I am boarding my means of separation. 
 We're worlds away and I cannot fathom the distance nor displacement in my absence. 
 I give chase though sworn I never would again, but this is change. Brace for impact. 

 After gathering thoughts and breath, I disembark. No degree of inhalation could have readied me. 
 Vines reaching as far as the eye can see, 
 Vegetation, bulbous and tempting. 
 At the sight, I do salivate but I do not dare indulge. 

 Trees gnarled in an elaborate conglomerate of tangled organic wonder, 
 Doors, hexagonal. 
 Ushered forth by bioluminescent spores in my descent, 
 Into cavernous peril. 

 Exotic foliage upturned by the onset of an ever-lingering humidity. 
 Evoking the thought of an open hand. Here is mine. 

 I endure where you could not. 

 Assuming the form of spiderball 

 Revitalize and resuscitate 
 A biome in my palm. 
 Reclaiming the varia. 
 Among the artifacts. 
 Collected in reservoirs, 
 The blue toxin, nil. 
 Remember me as I am now. 
 Prime.(Instrumental)Sometimes when I look at my life and the empty fighting,
I let go, no I'm not afraid, ashamed to cry
I hurt myself but I won't stop trying, I follow everyday living inside
Finally it's come, let it all go, all that I know
Finally it's right, every sight, not the same
Searching, looking into the mirror, that won't remember
Falling into something becoming blind
Trying why can't I see through the clearest weather
Leave me here with all of my light to shine
Finally it's come, let it all go, all that I know
Finally it's right, every sight, not the same
Turn the pages now, running around, all that I found
Looking out I see, inside of me, just this day
I keep it alive, knowing that soft subdues the hard way
A feeling of faith so new, a silence inside
Bringing me home without the heartache
Love is the place for you.Hide...while you complaint about the Wi-Fi
Hide...to keep a fraction of sanity
Hide...that soul needs some sixteen stitches
Hide...or be damaged permanently

So I hide
So I hide
Yes I hide
So I hide

Hide...from text messaging inferno
Hide...from the white noise deafening me
Tried to bang my bone head bloody
Against the hulking walls of stupidity

So I hide
So I hide
Yes I hide
So I hide

Hide...we could hide ourselves together
Hide...and we can struggle to get real

So we hide
Yes we hide
So we hideI've thought that,
That I could reach the stars
But now I am trapped
Between visions and lies 

Was there a wrong decision
Or just another question why
Paralyzed before my twisted mind

Starring at my window
I see a mirror grey
In the reflection of the glass
My life passes before my eyes,
Before my...

Haunted by my own game
The voice is calling
My spirit is falling
Into the flames
Aching for life

Watch my time fades away
The pain is growing
What if tomorrow
Will never come
Over and over
I'm losing myself

I claim no forgiveness
I am haunted by my guiltiness
Beneath the shadow of my doubts
No sanctuary through my misty mind

Starring at my window
I see a mirror grey
In the reflection
All my life passed by
Before my eyes

A game of illusions
Hear the voice is calling
My spirit is falling
Into the flames
Aching for life

Watch my time fades away
The pain is growing
What if tomorrow
Will never come
Over and over
I'm losing this game(Instrumental)We live in this world
Where life is purely war
We are only scars
That remain on this earth

Holocaust and death
Holocaust and death

The crazy man of domination
Can't understand
That our minds are obstacles
to what can happen

Holocaust and death
Holocaust and death

Each man is the munition
Of attack result
Each one will be a victim
To rum out of everythingBad feeling, so low
Bad feeling, eden destroyed

Can't say, how close
You can smell it, in the airIt's the small details that matter,
Those are what create beauty,
They are the truest of the real,
Hints, clues, things left overlooked,

It's sad how noone sees the full picture,
You'd be surprised what can be revealed,
It's not about fighting travesty,
All there is..is the truth,

(bridge)
Prisoner now freed,
With purity of heart and mind,
With newfound vision, I owe you,
I owe you for showing me I'm alive,

(chorus)
It really is possible,
Someone can know you better than you,
They always remember those things,
Minute details you'll never see,

Keen eyes even miss it,
Madness can expose truths,
Again covering my scarred arms,
The Beast rears its ugly head again!!Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders,
Here are the young men, well where have they been?
We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?(Instrumental)Dead trees like claws tear a dull sky 
An obsidian dolmen upon an empty hill 
Aeons have passed without a single motion 
The air smells of rotten filth 

There is no moon to reflect the light 
A deathlike aura emanates from the land 
The ground covered in ebony fog 
Awaiting a storm that has never come(Instrumental)You reached a certain age and the panic's kicking you
Stuck in that bunker, running out time
Suddlenly aware of your own mortality

When that career isn't exactly a hole in one
What you wouldn't do for a tiny slice of success
To boost that place in the bourgeois hierarchy

I ain't you bro
I don't wanna golf
Bad for mojo
I don't wanna golf
Forever no
I don't wanna golf

The symbolism of another shit-expensive club
Perhaps the Maruman Majerty Prestigio Driver?
And yet you never hit the ball
And you most likely never wil...

I ain't you bro
I don't wanna golf
Bad for mojo
I don't wanna golf
Forever no
I don't wanna golf

Fire the caddie
Take it out on the wife
Thank yout mom and daddy
For your miserable life

I ain't you bro
I don't wanna golf
Bad for mojo
I don't wanna golf
Forever no
I don't wanna golf(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The Lords below, masters beyond time
The Ancient Ones control your destiny and mine
Unholy wisdom beyond compare
The blackened secrets... for those who dare

Your fate is at the mercy of masters you deny
Your future has been written by the forces you defy

For each boundry that has been broken, a new gateway to hell has been opened
For each blasphemous word that is spoken, there is a number and name in Goetia

You search for answers but only find
That darkest dungeon within your mind
We all shall reap as we have sown
Naught but a curse to call your own

For each boundry that has been broken, a new gateway to hell has been opened
For each blasphemous word that is spoken, there is a number and name in Goetia
There will soon come a time when your number is called

I am the sword of the chosen... the dark avenger who opposes
You fucking lie about the things you've done... you parasitic bitch - your time has come
You tainted the gifts that you were given... made your world unfit to live in
Heed the words of wisdom from the man named Thorn:
You fuck with the Devil... you get the horns!

Cosmic violation beyond redemption
Torture eternal without exception
The Lords below demand veneration
The Laws remain without expirationMountains of woe
Explore the deepest holes
Deserts barren and burning
Oceans churning and cold

Struggling with invisible foes
Climbing infinite walls
Swimming against the flow
Drowning in a slough
Fighting for a noble goal
Still losing the soul

The time has come
To choose the direction
To close ones eyes
And go, just go and never stop

The path is brighter with eyes shut
Just go on and never stopI search for another others other
To make me feel whole
Because I feel as though
I'm half empty
But billions know of my entity
Unfortunately
They have no idea that I in you and we exist
They just know
That we are
We are other others
Searching for one another
I guess?
How amazing it is, that amazingly we know this and don't
Perhaps this condition, this inherent need for repetition is an incurable affliction
The human swing, swing swing, the pendulum it swings, begins then swings again
Swing swing, swing swing
The human swing, swings and swings
Swings and swings, swings and swings
The human swing, swings and swings
Swings and swings
Again
Swing swing
AGAINWe infer, rather than perceive 
 The remembered present 
 The harvesting of ruins 
 A regress that always ends in darkness 
 Finite provinces of meaning 
 The moment already far away 
 Blind keys spin 
 Horns echo backward 
 Time is an abyss(Instrumental)What you got?
You got a piece of me
If you don't care
Open your eyes to see
Don't give a damm
For what you wanna be
So try your best and
Fuck you!

You know
That you don't live in my world

Living somewhere places
I will be there
Life is unknow
And sometimes is not fare
Feeling insane
Go to hell
Go cry, go to hell

Don't never say
That you wanna cry
The time is coming
And you must die.ONE SINCERE TEAR TO MOVE A HEART OF STONE
ONE GOOD WISH TO TURN A STONE INTO GOLD
ONE SMILE TO MAKE THE SUN SHINE
ONE GOOD REASON TO MAKE YOU MINE

ONE NIGHT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE AWAY
ONE DAY MORE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE AWAY
ONE LOOK TO PUT A SPELL ON YOU
ONE TOUCH AND I WILL GET THROUGH YOU

ALL THOSE LESSONS FROM LIFE I'VE BEEN TAUGHT
ARE TO TELL THE RIGHT FROM THE WRONG
WORDS OF WISDOM APPEAR ONCE AGAIN
TELLING THAT BLACK AND BLACK ARE NOT THE SAME

ONE FALSE MOVE TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO NOTHING
ONE CRUEL WORD TO TURN LAUGHING INTO CRYING
ONE MOVE TO FRITTER PRECIOUS SEEDS AWAY
ONE STEP TO MAKE YOUR BLOODY DAYBackfilled trenches bury cancer intensive dreams 
In razor wire orchards and bar code reefs 
(Where) Primary extinction communicates its intent 
On a 
Trajectory of 
Ruin 
Acrid 
Stock 
Chokes 
The Ground 
Renewed 
Concern 
For the strontium 90 offspring 

Boiling dust stands in pools of molten glass 
Severe contamination of irradiated dreams 
Nuclear reservations and burial gardens 
Alpha particles stir in the poison breeze 

Planting yellow posts 
In the sand 
The trail markers of irradiated dreams 
Trapped in senseless illusions 
Compressed to a state 
Of critical massIn the bleak wind blown from space
In the dark, alone, unwilling, we embark
Hanging from the hidden roof of night
The black interim, the folded poppy
Mansions of fear, mansions of pain
Crossing the frontiers of darkness
To summon that which may consent
To be delayed, but not to be deniedThrough the unknown wanderer of wanders
Driven by a force I can't help but wonder
Through the ruins, through the forests, through the jungles
Find the spirit of the seven wonders

In the distance there's a roaring rumble
But this gathering is not what it once was
It's almost been forgotten
But I smell the fires
and I can see the smoke as I approach

I can hear it calling me back where I belong
Through the unknown to a Circle of Stones
Walk with me to the places I come from

Closing in on that roaring rumble
Restore the former glory like it used to be
If ever like it once was
Rebuild the fires
The smoke climbs higher, the beacon calls

I can hear it calling me back where I belong
Through the unknown to a Circle of Stones
Walk with me to the places I come from
This earth below my feet where I'll live and die

A little trek across all the regions
I need to wander, I need to wander
Through the unknown inside of it and
Live like I've never lived before

Through the unknown I walk until I'm crawling
I look up and see the one who's been calling

Then I know that I am back where I belong
Through the unknown to a Circle of Stones
When I've seen all the places I come from
And I'm back where I belong

Now I seeGather your men!
We ride to war!

The time has come!
Our blades of holy wrath fall swiftly!
Your end is near!
Trampled grass be thy tomb...

Your death is betrayed by the fall of my sword!
Your grave is opened!

Wrath of God come!
Sleep deeply in death...

Your corpse has risen into the sky...
Bleeding down upon the stars...
You have forgotten deep within the history's tomes...

In the far hills, the Word stands alone...
Christ has come!Dreams' reflections are interpretations of
this world. "Split a piece of wood and I am there.
Life a stone and you will find me." I will never
rest until I am found. 

The closer you come, tempation grows stronger.
You must find atonement for the demons. They 
will come and feed on the weak. I am all around 
you. I live inside you.

We are the enemy. Excommuned messengers
will come. The spirit alive as people put to death
in the name of god. 

I confess. The guilt overwhelms.
Show me his wounds. I must see them to believe, 
for hope has finally died.

On the Lake Geneva shoreline 
To make records with a mobile 
We didn't have much time 
Frank Zappa and the Mothers 
Were at the best place around 
But some stupid with a flare gun 
Burned the place to the ground 
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky 

They burned down the gambling house 
It died with an awful sound 
Funky Claude was running in and out 
Pulling kids out the ground 
When it all was over 
We had to find another place 
But Swiss time was running out 
It seemed that we would lose the race 
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky 

We ended up at the Grand Hotel 
It was empty cold and bare 
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside 
Making our music there 
With a few red lights and a few old beds 
We make a place to sweat 
No matter what we get out of this 
I know we'll never forget 
Smoke on the water, fire in the skyA trip on psylocibine
Hypercommunication supreme
Another toxic god, another toxic dream.

Symbiotic relation
Between nti si tho and human creation
The epitome of the transgalactic generation.

Invisible and Incorporeal
Seeing but not seen
An excursion to aeons of time and space
In the kingdom of psylocine.

New religions, televisions
Frustrations, depredations, this damned place
Would you give it all up
just for the little of bemushroomed grace?

"What today is resolved into the effects of a mere drug
a tryptamine or lysergic acid derivative, was for them
a prodigious miracle, inspiring in them poetry
philosophy and religion."

Phantasmagorical scenes
Beyond the veil of low-life schemes
A quick fix of madness and eternity juxtaposed.

Hollow creations, legislations
Caught within the social maze
End it up, give it up
Welcome to biosynthetic space.

"In truth, he is the five senses disembodied
all of them keyed to the height
of sensivity and awarness
all of them blending into one another most strangely
until the person, utterly passive
becomes a pure receptor
in delicate, of sensations.

As your body lies there in its sleeping bag
your soul is free
Loses all sense of time,alert as it never was before
Living an eternity of night
seeing infinity in a grain of sand.

What you have seen or heard is cut as with the burin
into your memory
Never to be effaced."

" Then, indeed, as you lie there bemushroomed
listening to the music and seeing visions
you know a soul-shattering experience
recalling as you do the belief of some primitive peoples
that mushrooms, the sacred mushrooms
are divinely engendered by Jupiter Fulminans
the god of the lighting bolt, in the soft mother earth.""We're gonna go back to our first album, this is Lunatic Of God's Creation!"

Glenn Benton, you sound funny, your voice is so funny, so funny, so funny! Your voice is so funny!From Darkness To Light
Heaven Is Nowhere In Sight
I hear the shrieks at night
Only to remind me of How I buried her that fateful night
In a cemetary full of fog,
beyond a vast forest
In A Sepulcher Beneath The Moon
There she lay
I shall soon see the whore dead , Her life hanging on by a thread
Her soul no on would ever save
As I stare at her for the final hour...
I look back at what was done
and what I had to endure
In A Sepulcher Beneath The Moon
there is no other way
I was led astray
Only to find your dismay
Now I laugh at what will soon be a corpse
I grabbed the shovel and I put her in her place
In A Sepulcher Beneath The Moon
I opened my heart once and never shall again.
The result a morbid black heart and now the burden
of murder shall start I look down at what I had and remember
what was in a sepulcher beneath the moon
the result a morbid black heart and now the burden of murder shall start
killing the one I trusted, shrouded in gloom
My guilt will never cease but all for fairness atleast
In a sepulcher beneath the moon
the morbid result I killed her so
I opened my heart once and never shall again
Never to see the light again
I embraced the everlasting sin
As a result of this madness I feel consumed
The immense tragic parting of misanthropy
from love once again
In A Sepulcher Beneath The Moon
I CURSE LOVE
And The fire burns deep within me
And thus, the story of how I killed my only one
Sepulcher Beneath The Moon
I CURSE LOVE
And thus, the story of how I killed (my love) My only one.Track list:

I saw last night
a shining blast in front of my eyes
but (who knows why) I didn't wanted to discover
what is hiding on the other side
(fuck, maybe it was even worse there)I am nothing, I am love
I am hate, hate my love, love my hate
I am empty, but i'm hopeful
I can see, and i'm fearful
I am nothing, feel like everything
I am scared

seems this is your final day
have I strenght to go through this
it's easier for you, you will find your peace

in this world, that I detest so much
there's always the need for a gentle touch
one sign of it now it's gone with you
I wonder now, can you see it too
your life passing throughDistant voices they call to me, thousands of screams 
They always follow, Tapping...Ticking...I'm constantly questioning 
Insanity, eating away, this Paranoia that suffocates through the days 
Feeding on my mind. 

I can feel the shadows lurking. 
They seek to suck the life within. 
Hallowed be the empty eye. 
Glued to my every move, eating away, this Paranoia that penetrates 
through the days, feeding on my mind. 

Each passing minute, fleeting hours, dreaded days, 
Something is there, knocking on my window, paralyzed in fear. 

Spiritual awakening I can't resist, as i feel complete submission to my doubts. Who is there? Are you real?Radical Changes

Live, live, live!
Live without lies
Live without hate
Live without greed
Live without pain

We want another kind of truth
Another kind of life
The past is just a image
And future never dies
We look to everything
With another eye
We think at all
In another way

Nothing will be the same
Something must changed
Live, live, live!

We know that a life
It isn't a business
And life it isn't a deal
We know that a life
It isn't a hell
The life is not a dream
Nothing will be the same
Something must changedWith her last breath, her body became faint and dissolved into mist. Edward, who had had hardly enough time to comprehend all that was said, fell to his knees. He wept softly. Edward stood alone, as the fog curled back in. Though he felt that a hole had been opened within him because of his loss, he also felt fulfilled because he had helped her. He knew his love would live on forever...

In the mist, she faded the same
The forest, empty like his heart
Empty...
A meeting of silver starlight and fading beauty
A blessing in the dissolving ether
Lady moon, my dear... my dear... 
Don't leave me hereSiamo venuti dall'Inferno 
Per bruciare le volanti 
Cravattino per distinzione 
Un assassino per eroe 
I corpi stesi a terra 

Touchdown 

Touchdown 

Touchdown 

ToruchdownThe fog is a sinister form of nature 
And it is creeping slowly above the ground 

But on the highway, it kills people 
A sacrifice for Mother Nature?Can't I live this neverending night?
 Your shadow appears before my eyes again
 I don't see your face but hear your voice:
 "Where did you were, Gerd of Golden Rings,
 When packs of hungry wolves
 Pulled my body apart, greedly champing
 And crows peeked my eyes out?
 View of my troops in sorrowful,
 Cause now it's a pile of bloody flesh,
 I have been entombed under strong tree
 At the bridge in alien cold land:"
 I prayed to holy Theothokos for you,
 I cryed on the bordes grey stones
 I asked heaven to give you a victory
 But gods only laughed at me:
 "Ha! Should you mourn?
 After all you had blessed them to death."
 Now my drakkar ran aground forever
 "And my safe sword rusted
 I had became the gray shadow unforgiven
 And doomed to eternal room in Darkness.
 Unforgiven for those, whose blood is on my hands,
 Whose mothers and wives are crying now
 I see companions of Odin will look after you
 Whose bones this bank has been studded.
 It's too great palment for There's a place beyond L.A.
Where the dry desert winds blow
And the souls of children
Lie in the days
Where dreams should be simple
But reality gets in the way
And here if you listen closely
You can hear the little ghosts play

Little Deedrie was her name
Mommy was on methamphetamine
She was ready for Small World
Before the monsters came
She looked out the door
With her pretty eyes
and neatly combed hair
Nobody heard her scream
And no one even caredZu gehen bereit zu gehen bereit
Aaaa Aaaa Aaaa Aaaa
Aaaaaa Aaaaaa Aaaaaa(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)His poor weakened karma
Took wing and faded away. It's no longer here
(not been in the long time)
His whispered innocence, his missing self defense
Made him pleasing for the wolves
He smokes a cigarette now
He thinks of the time he wasted
Trying to be a different man... for them...
He turns his back, sits tight, all In black
waiting to fall down just like a heart attack
He wants to fade away

Oh why? There is something inside. In his head, so bad,
that is hurting and no one really cares to know
The life & death of Mr. Nobody
Oh why? There is something inside. In his head,
so sad, that is hurting and nobody really cares.
The life & death of Mr. Nobody

He's been living his life always holding a knife...
aimed at his own veins
never hoped for heaven he knew this was the truth
Sensibility. His worst enemy
A beautiful child. A sad destiny
Yeah he is still living in a bubble so strong and
yet so easy to break, so easy to break
He turns his back, sits tight, all in black
waiting to fall down just like a heart attack
He faded away... this time he faded away

I throw my hands on him, throw my hands on him
He's so cold like a flower that did not even care to grow
The life & death of Mr. Nobody

It hadn't been for all the malice in this world
He could have blossomed like the purest of roses
Now he is no more...

Oh why? There is something inside. In his head,
he always tried to change for you all but you never
understood his wonderful spirit and soul... Mr. Nobody
Oh why? There is something inside. In his head,
so sad, that is hurting and nobody really cares.
The life & death of Mr. NobodyJesus... 
Great savior...
I am unworthy of Your grace!
What have I done but spit in Your face? 
What have I done but dwell in disgrace?
Your hand is mighty, my heart is weak
Deep in darkness I sit, covered in despair
I am far from You, yet Your hand... 
Your hand sustains me...
Your light dispels the night in my soul!
Father! Father! Your kingdom is forever!Ancient gods have said to me this is the end of vanity 
A child's voice is free to say it doesn't have to end this way 
Whispers from an ancient dream when gods and men 
Would intervene and change the course of all we've known 
And kick our leaders from control 
They've plugged us in and they sold our minds 
And they held us here and destroyed our kind 
And it's been this way forever since the dawn of time 
Look now at the monsters we've become 
For all we are we and all we've seen the paradise 
Turned obscene an evil blight has claimed this earth 
And paralyzed our rebirth 
They've held us back and installed their god 
They've held us here and while they numbed our kind 
It's been this way forever since the dawn of time 
They've plugged us in and destroyed our minds 
While they held us here and erased our kind 
Its been this way forever since the dawn of time 
They've hooked us up and erased our lives 
They left us here and they watch us die 
And it will stay this way forever til everyone has died 
Ages pass pages bleed the truth of our insanity 
We led our lives down the gluttons road 
And let our leaders take control 
Of all we are and all we've seen the paradise 
Turned obscene an evil blight has claimed this earth 
And paralyzed our rebirth 
Behold the pages said to me this is the age of hypocrisy 
Visions burn to change all things the truth about our human dreams 
A child's poem is what we've lost we carry on despite the cost 
Revolution's begun felt in the hearts and the minds 
in mouth and thoughts of the masses 
Evolution's begun felt in the lives in the eyes and heart of the masses 
Revolution's begun felt in the hearts and the minds 
in mouth and the thoughts of the masses 
Evolution's begun felt in the hearts and the minds in the laws of the passive 
Staring out into this abyss, tell me you never loved anyone more 
Holding on to times that went amiss tell me you never loved anyone more 
Tell me you never loved anyone more 
Staring into this abyss tell me you never loved anyone morehave you ever ruminated about over-imposed vanity 
trying to keep the ground from floating into obscurity 
any attempt to summarize manifold complexities 
will find itself in a position where truth is just a mere property 
this room shall blend all the sounds of ideals 
coming from distinct opinions and theories 
unity is chaos and pandemonium on a set of wheels 
walls will administer contrasting sources without partiality 
set your attack - set your decay 
i want to believe there is assurance beyond all reasons 
maneuvers that eliminate contradictory matters of distinctions 
twisting perilously until all sounds start to dissolve and fade 
this selfishness will shatter as space inside began to agitate 

[september - october 2012]We are the one still dreaming
We are the never ending light
In silence we will win this fight...

6 years old, I was told "You got a very bad disease boy"
I won the fight now I'm alright but I'm always on the look out
(But) no disease, no surprise will harm me more than killing words,
The misery you spit on me to show the world you're number one

I am the one still dreaming
I am the never ending light
In silence I will win this fight

In this world, I was told to be heard you gotta shout loud
"Actions speak louder than words" But they tell me I was wrong now
All the shit, all the lies trying to erase my footprints
Listen to that little voice and you will know I'm number one

I am the one still dreaming
I am the never ending light
In silence I will win this fight

No more lonely bleedings no more broken hearts
I'm the one who'll win this worthless fight
I know I'm getting near, I know I'm getting near, yeah

Listen to my silence now. Brothers and sisters hear my call
Few words to say we are an army - We are the chosen ones
Listen to your heart now. And united we will fight against them all
We are the ones, we'll be the winners in the end
Dream away, dream away baby... Dream away Oh!

We are the one still dreaming
We are the never ending light
In silence we will win this fight

No more lonely bleedings no more broken hearts
We are the one who'll win this worthless fight
I know we're getting near, I know we're getting near, yeahEvil forces distend my chest
Blades slash my body
I am on razor edge
The hereafter calls me

I suffer torments
Blood flows everywhere
Death lifts rocks
Fire already burns my body

Flames of Purgatory burns my body
Life strikes back now.

I suffer torments
Blood flows everywhere
I am on razor edge
The hereafter calls me.(Eklundh)

The sun is kind of annoying
As I try to sleep in the back of my van
It is supposed to be autumn
Did someone mess with The Plan? 

Feels like my skin doesn't fit me
But it's one mother of a tan
Barbecued might be the right description
As I walk around in this frying pan

Give me a damn good reason not to worry
Give me a damn good reason
'Cos I refuse to sit here on my ass and drown
When we burn our bridges down

Now it's been a while since I last wrote
The ground has been just as green as before
The yesterday my street turned kinda arctic
Now I can't get out of my front door

Give me a damn good reason not to worry
Give me a damn good reason
'Cos I refuse to sit here on my ass and drown
When we burn our bridges downDamage has arisen from my need to purify
The charm of novelty exhausting my fear of charity
Love like a strong brick to the heart
A bound reality
Lock to a frayed cage that sways
Down to nothingness

Aggression my dirty flesh the sign
Depression needs more flesh to live

Silence deletes this wind
Premature indication of dark
Can't go back and see that face
On the crystal Figurine

Destruction my last vision of life
Masturbation the only friend I have

All alone with a desperate lie
Awake from deep disgrace to hear
There's no recall to surface
The future of disposed land
All alone with dissenter breed
To have bride and will to be
I came along these bitter years
Death surprises my loneliness

The experience of lie kills creative ability
Asylum for dependence is the cure to my disgrace
Oppression falls into parts today
Temination my executed mindIt was the storm that gave me visions of the WRONG

Forced from sleep and soaked in sweat to witness
It's like there's two different skies
Blends of tones and the colours even seem to
Play trick on my eyes
Trembling's passed onto everything around me
Pounding echoed in bones
Flashes're burnt into every shade of the conscious
Thundering their song

No step gets me further
Drawn in is the surface
What is driven outwards?
Mind can't surpass

Up untill this day I had full sway of what was supposed to be me
Now I see him marching away

As the moon is calming wind 
and thickens light and clears the sky
Seethes the madness, soul that's ravaged
Is storming my mind
Wrings the chaos in to blur the sane 
And make me guess what's "I"
Never ending maze of mystery,
never ending maze of mystery
just makes me writhe

The gaze won't reach the mind's eye 

As the moon is calming wind
and thickens light and clears the sky
Seethes the madness, soul that's ravaged
Is storming my mind
Wrings the chaos in to blur the sane
and make me guess what's "I"
Never ending maze of mystery 
just makes me writhe
All wandering,
Pale, I exhale as the skin gets under nails

Boil the cat!!

Boil the Cat
(cat's howling in pain)Travelled in time, left earth behind. 
In search of the I,just to face the inside. 
The spirit layed to the unknown,the body was lost in way back home. 
The passage through the portal 
The choice of outter space. 
Freedom of the dying star. 
Until it's gone it shines green and bright. 
With sharp reflections,Starring the deep blue sky. 
A dark connection, of brain and time. 
Timetravelling, among the stellar world there is no home for him 
Wandering in Aphrodite, eternal problem is the guns , the girls and drinksMusic and Lyrics: Gustavo Sierra H

Voices...In my brain...
I hear...what they say...
Confusion remains (-CONFUSION REMAINS!-).

Terror rising, (the) fear I'm embracing, 
(the) thoughts are dancing...
Terror rising, the things are painting horrid dreams...
Terror rising, (the) ghosts are showing nightmare extremes.
JA JA JA JA! 
(I Should) end now the dream!. 
My mind should be clear 
(I Should) end now the dream!. 
to face my own fear....

Why I'm living?. Why I'm asking (it)?...
Why I'm smiling while I'm suffering?.
Why this feeling?. 
I'm just EMPTY, I'm just DYING... 
(I should) end now the dream, 
My mind should be clear 
to face my own fear 
(I hear a voice remembering me) NOTHING IS EASY, DEAR!...

If I'm smiling why I'm suffering?...
Why this feeling?...
I'm just empty,I'm just dying...
why this feeling? 
Now I see how I'm (still) dreaming!...
terror rising, this fear I'm embracing, 
(that's why) my thoughts are screaming!...

In the confusion's train I'm moving to the chaos land, 
In the confusion's train feeling the noisy rails of my mind, 
In MY confusion's train
(-I hear it clear and loud:-)
weee weee weee weee!!
NOW I'm living in my...living in my...
living in my TRAIN!Why do the babies starve
when there's food to feed the world?
why when there's so many of us
there are people all alone?

But somebody gonna have answered
to the lies, to the oryness, to the falsify
love is hate, war is peace, no is yes
there is nothing we can do!
how many lies! In the name of black blood

Why do the misales are called peace keepers
when they are smed to far?

Why is a woman still not dafe

But somebody gonna have answered

How many lies
in the name of black blood

How many dead

why when there's so many of us
there are people all alone?

(CHORUS)(Instrumental)(Verse) 

High atop the mountains 
I reign down below 
With this wealth, I own 
This land of ice and snow 
Brace for war on my command 
We will fight the horde 
I'm the hero of the day 
Never picked up the sword 

(Prechorus) 

Deep in the castle, I watch you 
All fight, to death 
From greed and lust for, wealth 
For me, just fear this power. 


(Chorus) 

Hearing the cries of the dead 

Death is the law of the land 
The power to speak for the masses 
And fight for the greater good 

Verse II 

Fool atop his own thought 
He gaze from below 
My words are thunder 
And you will fear them all 
Question not, I know this land 
You will sow discord 
I will paint you the villain 
Else divide the nation 

(PreChorus) 

Force of my hand, commanding masses 
Crushed their hope, it will be the first light 
Fire of theirs, I'll see it out 

(Chorus) 
Hearing the cries of the dead 
Death is the law of the land 
The power to speak for the masses 
The masses, the masses 

melodic Verse 

My rule, has spanned, many, decades. 
How dare, he question me, today. 
We must, spill blood, to go, on. 
A rule that will remain as law. 

as I, sit here, upon, my throne. 
I will watch them from, above. 
The wizard will, recall, how 
he could end his life.

-End-Fleeing from cataclysm
Decimation!
Decimation of entire population

Seeing what is to come
Manipulation!
Manipulation of entire population

Being or to become
Assimilated!
Assimilation of entire population

Reading signs from above
Invocation!
Invocation of entire population

We must never allow this again
They will atone for all their sins

Bow down now!Fogging stark crepuscules
awash with squald aghast
course in septic blight

Drones of inequity
servile of manors steer
knell of antiquate tide

Sub-ornament creeking carcasses
stagger blackest harbours
moored frothing profuse

Bow oh graving facesFalling further from your god
Deeper into your casket
Deeper into the pain!
Falling further into Anguish
Into the hollow depths
Into eternal rest.


As I gaze, through the night
Hatred  fills my heart
and the blood starts to boil!
Then I know it is the time
to step beyond the light
to carry on my blood!


I`ll burn you bastards 
to the ground
I will carry on my legacy
The legacy of the ancient ones.
This is my heart and my soul.
The purest form  of divinity
The ancient One!
The ancient Blood!

We are here, over you
Taking  this desert of souls!Once there was a child
feeling the pain
Now he's insane
Look at them now
tearing the flesh, ripping
Into his brain

See how they can play
crushing my strength
releasing infernal rage
I feel it in blood
tethered by fate
Night is my cage

Nothing enters my world
Timeless and still
My bones still scream
Men shattered and drifting
claim to recover me
Now feel my rage

Cold, Vanquishing, Spirit

See me Laughing
Crushing your skull

Breathing Letting go
snapping letting go

Your bond, your word
Vapid and draining
No more shall I
Respect your world

Once there was a child
felling the pain
Now he's insane
Once they were like me
touching disease, breathing
deaths slow embrace

Feared, wanted, and tired
traitors, they follow me
Dripping into the night
They take me away
never too still, fearing
desiring what they do see

Blades, swords at there
throats, lapping their
vanquishing spirit
Into my veinsAn atom of prior insignificance, 
Pulses with devastating potential 
To be more than this mortal coil, 
To devide time and space 

Atomic diffusion! 
The blinding of eyes that see into the heavens 
Incineration of the macrocosm 

The life spreads out, as the death unfolds 
The heavens erupt an earthly hell 
Old gives way to the new, the one remaining law 
The microcosm envelops all 

Bear witness to the miracle, 
That shakes the earth's foundations 
Lightspeed evolution 
A man-made godWhat you see in me is a lie 
Crying alone inside, wishing to die 
I walk on the line, contemplate suicide every day 
Gaining momentum, watching the pavement close in on me, breaking the fall 

Chasing death before I ever give my 
Self a chance 
To live what one would consider a normal life 
But I can't 
Seem to get it right, I always fuck up 
Everything 
Half dead, half alive 

Soul is degrading, waiting for pain 
As another day passes by, feeling the same 
I'm blinded to change, failing to realize other ways 
To challenge myself, give my life meaning again 
Taking control 

Chasing death before I ever give my 
Self a chance 
To live what one would consider a normal life 
But I can't 
Seem to get it right, I always fuck up 
Everything 
Half dead, half alive 

How do you suppose I live when I feel dead inside? 
Juxtapose, carry on even though I know I'm losing my mind 
Desperate to control all the voices in the back of my head 
Telling me that my life is a waste and I'm better off deadDvorkin is a strange man whom nobody ever saw. The sage who created his labyrinth with the help of the stone of Justice & the blood of Unicorn. He is the genius who draw the Maps & who evidently created Amber & it's reflections. We don't really know this old man who was cloistered in the dungeon from our eyes. Only Korvin will get acquainted with him during his imprisonment. Tribute to DvorkinWithout being defiled...
His savage barbarity was equaled by the consummate coolness
I was ready...
There was no rejection

He told me with great solemnity
"Go forth!"
I must forge! I must go back!
Before I do, I must lure him into another section of the forest
My legs were torn in sundry places and covered in blood
In the wilderness, forlorn with hunger, the plan was set
I concluded
Starvation

Voluntarily, I began to eat my own flesh
This is what I wanted
The sound of the wild depressed my spirit
Filling me with the most ineffable sadness

Hatred, manifesting....
Self-loathing, oppressing....

I often found myself regretting my very existence
This thought was often shallow and grave
This was never easy to overcome
Impulsively
Reluctantly
I sank down, mourning over my wretched condition
Wishing myself to be deadAn insistent sadness in the texture of things
Dusk, silence, iron chill
Loneliness in the bones
The sharpness of lengthening shadows
The grotesque transition from day to night
The fear and dread of you
All the beasts of the earth
And all the birds of the air
Every creature that moves along the ground
All the fish of the sea
They are given into your hands
Reasons are echoes,
Make no differenceI swore I saw you sitting on my bow
With a foot long smile trying to convince me
That it's okay to give into the waves
And that I wouldn't feel a thing
When the hounds of the sea start to take apart me ending my suffering
If I should pour the rest of my bottle overboard will it sting the eyes? 
Those black eyes staring up at me from behind all those teeth?
Or should I save the last sip for my frozen gut and my blue lips?Leave me
With the cinder
That is my thought
With the bruises
That my senses
Have wrought
Never rue
And the chance
Never rue
And the chance
That I rebuke
Though a likeness
Never rue
Never rue
I can no longer inhabit it
The essence of my failure
When separate roads undone
Crave timid rain
The weight of memory pressed
Into my skin
Like a brandWake Up Modern Man, Alert Your selvesWe're never seeking for youth
Believing there's something we need
Respect the honour
Splashing the torment of loss

Christ our servant obeys
I'm flattered
He killed my only belief
The negative youth

We build up a chaos
Asylum is not made from grace
Withdraw, we're never
Giving the pleasure of winning

The brains are damaged flesh
I'm staring
Deep down to massive crowd
They're sinking

Now mind's an open time
Drifting out of sight
Trusting in servitude
How come these souls are moved
Now time's an open mind
Negative youth
Our side
Now time's an open mind
Negative youth
Our side

Refuse, we dissent
Insisting our justice is freedom
Remorse - injury
Is not what we're going to ownSuch visions I've seen with shut eyes.
Must believe in the place that you've woke in.
Lidded eyes witness reticent events.

Teething my grind is confusing.
This somnambulist's mind is exhausting.
Who is the master in this house of my making?
Downside up, left side right.Waiting for the sun
to burn away the season
revealing the place we called home
built by our blood and our blood alone

We will find our summit again

This blood does not flow through her veins
as she walks on floors by mother laid
sheltered by the roof my father built tall
to shield us from all that may fall

We will find our summit again
it will take more than the snow
to bury all that you have known

Waiting for the sun to burn away the season
revealing the place we called home
built by our blood and our blood alone
soon will come the winter's end
we will find our summit again
it will take more than the snow
to bury all that you have knownFire!

A scarlet shine into the horizon
A golden beast with blazing wings
Filled with pure and eternal fire
Swirling like a myth in a twist
Like a wraith his smoke arise
Into sulphur fiery skies
A crimson raptor who shakes the earth
Baptized by...

A bird of fire, a satan's seed
From the ashes he is rising
Mighty power, torrid fist

Fire walk with me
Pyrogenesis

Rise! Rise! Rise from the flames
With mighty talons, powerful and proud

Burnt! Burnt! Burnt into rage
A bird that soars higher than a cloud

The only one who resisted from the knowledge tree
The only descendant from the fire and sun
Coming from the constellation of Sirius
Forerunner of a new cosmic era

Rise! Rise! Rise from the flames
Where wind blows and blusters mightily

Burnt! Burnt! Burnt into rage
Reborn from ashes in a vicious heat

Phoenix
Ruler of the earth
Phoenix
Commander of heaven
Phoenix
Bringer of light and hell
Phoenix
The Prometheus' dream

Rise! Rise! Rise from the flames
With mighty talons, powerful and proud

Burnt! Burnt! Burnt into rage
Reborn from ashes in a vicious heat

Fire walk with me
Pyrogenesis
Fire walk with me
PyrogenesisThunder brings in the rain in the day
Of the mystical battle
You can see black horses in the night
Riding over black clouds
In the night, you hear the screams of war
And those screams are the angry spirits
Rising from their graves

War and death
Blood and fire
Will be our victory
With sword in hand
Ready to kill the enemy
Holy blood will spill on the ground
That night angels will cry
Demons and vampires
Will drink the blood of our victory(Instrumental)I might as well commit suicide one day, it is on my mind. However, death is not an "escape" for me. I never could believe those who claim to have achieved a religious or irreligious certainty regarding death. Romanticizing death as an escape or a profane finality is not "realistic" to me. Thinking death is the good escape is the same as thinking any sort of materialistic or personal change is going to be the triumph for someone who is not happy with their current situation. Having said that, it is as logical and as mundane a change as those things for me. Accepting an occupational offer from a distant town is same as accepting to end one's life. Playing with death is playing with uncertainty, we do it everyday. Death is the ultimate uncertainty; nobody knows what is going to come out from it. Just like nobody has any tangible information as to what consciousness "is" they have got no clue what death means to the "individual" if there is such a thing or lack thereof.I won't regret a thing
You made me do this, you know it
Right from the start you tried to drown me
Every single thing I did was a failure
I never got a chance to correct it
Because I were never ever good enough for you or your values

Don't you ever patronize me again
I'm sick of your constant criticism
You will never change me 
So get away from me, leave me alone 

I won't regret a thing
You made me do this, you know it
You slowly disassembled me, unnoticed
I guess I was lost in the infatuation
I have always spoken my opinion no matter what or who
But you used it against me, and took away my only faith 

Don't you ever patronize me again
I'm sick of your constant criticism
You will never change me 
So get away from me, leave me alone

I wish I could hate you
But I know I can't 
Because in a sick and twisted way I am thankful
That you showed me who I might be

I'm not the source
Of your constant problems
Look at yourself instead
To find the roots of your pain

So stop
Blaming me
It's your own fault
I will never regress

I'm not the source
Of your agony
Look inside yourself instead
I already hate myself because of you

So get away from me, leave me alone
And stop
Blaming me
It's your own fault
That your life has no meaning
I will never regress, I will never regret(Instrumental)By your words you will be condemned. Surgical tools - coding. Is this progress? Computers steal jobs. Suffocating. We are what this world designed, we are numbered, tracked and sold. Using cancer as a form of population control. I smell you suffering from ass to cunt. Nuclear holocaust. A new world leader. You worship your Television. The mass departure of consciousness. Your souls consumed. Our heroes suck from open wounds. Our lives systematized by occults. Evidence destroyed.(Instrumental)The quick and the dead have all been judged, 
But not me...
I've been chosen immortal,
For the gods have a different plan for me,

Even upon the calling one must choose their own fate,
Blessed are we to have this right,
Like pawns in a game, but with minds of our own,
We choose what side we fight on,

Good?..Evil?
Victory on either side has its spoils,
But they also have their curses..their duties,
Their callings...

What side am I on anyway?
Perhaps..I'm too mad to know...(Instrumental)Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light!
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light!
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light!
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light!
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never landForces that be have left you to flee, nothing you knew could save you. You've seen the same patterns within everything you beheld and thought that nothing will ever change. The only reason that you haven't committed suicide was for fear of worse. Convinced that you are a prisoner, you felt like paying the price of something you don't remember. You hate yourself and everything around. What if
I told you that there is an out of this prison and it is not mere suicide, something much harder to accomplish. Something that needs constant concentration, something that needs true devotion, perhaps the reason you are here. Like a psychedelic nightmare addiction. Like infected crosses raining on you, a morbid vision. Enter the world of the underworld, the neverending spear of the foe. Work through your confusion, as confusion replaced rain forests. Walk through thoughts that beg for order. Walk as they make you bleed. Walk for the moment and taste your own pain. A new you is born every scar, a new time, a new space, a new dimension. Once open the eyes can never close. Follow the bringer of true light!Mount vein is high
Rake side by side
Walls lurch, they cry
Preys mourn, they fly
Seas turning black
While ashes crack
Birds seeking flesh
Dark earth has bled

Ancient pain,
Fire goddess
Burning sane,
All sirens
Giants rage,
Hades power
Molten hate,
Haunting cloud

Crave pounding cross
Eight horses of lust
Lake christ is near
These clouds of fear
Gold, marts of slaves
Wood, endless void
These lands of sheep
Urged mermaids of deep(Eklundh)

Hey, what's going on?
Drool before I'm gone
Waste some precious time, you know 

Sure I'm looking good
Don't you think I would?
I got Cindy Crawford's video 

Go and get the blow
I know where to go
Coolest place you ever seen 

Maybe we can dance
In a bathroom romance
To a ballad of East 17

Try some ecstasy
Get as dumb as me
Read even Sting's a fan 

Rave 'til the end
Invent another trend:
Mandela joins the Ku Klux Klan 

Any way the wind blow
I swallow everything!
Any way the winds blow
I'll sing the words you sing!
That is how the story goes
Consume 'til I get sick!
Any way the winds blow
Proud to be plastic! 

Prozac with tea
One happy family
Still remember how to laugh 

Dad gets Mommy wet
With porno on the Net
My brother spits his guts in half 

I don't really care
Gotta do my hair
To get Eddie Vedder's autograph 

I am V.I.P
You can come with me
Just get another pair of shoes

We can rob a bar
Then we steal a car
Smoke someone and we'll be news 

Show me you're romantic
Let me your chick
Shoot some dude to prove you're mine 

Show me you're romantic
Let me your chick
Send shivers down my teenage spine
Any way the wind blow
I swallow everything!
Any way the winds blow
I'll sing the words you sing!
That is how the story goes
Consume 'til I get sick!
Any way the winds blow

Proud to be plastic!(music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras)

Don't like it easy, and I'll never will
I never saw myself there standing still
A time for passion and a time for pain
none of the things I do will be in vain

Never, never will I change shape and leave you alone
Never, never will I swallow this stone

//chorus
All the sins, the mistakes I am not gonna break
and I'll never turn my back, never turn my back now
I may have lost just a couple of fights
but I will win the war, and never turn my back - no more

The storm awakened, storm got me down
in this blue ocean they have made me drown
But even though they'll never disappear
the wounds have healed - now I have no fear
Never, never will I change shape and leave you alone
Never, never will I swallow this stone

//chorus

You make me feel like someone, you makeme feel
You make me feel like someone who's not gonne die alone

Five milleniums of history
On our path of blood and bones
Territorial and holy wars
In the name of never seen gods

Oh Gates of Babylon
We opened out wide
with greed and hate
Cursed by our heritage

All religions praise their judgement day
But can't you see we made it dawn, eight centuries ago?
And now it's much too late
No way to face our grinning fate

Oh Gates of Babylon
We opened out wide
with greed and hate
Cursed by our heritage

[solo Chris, Luca]

Oh dear, now it's too late
Taste the knife rippin' up our back
On a black and slow decay
The chance we had, we wasted away

Oh Gates of Babylon
We opened out wide
With greed and hate
We all failed and now we'll pay!

All religions praise their judgement day
But can't you see we made it dawn, eight centuries ago?
And now it's much too late
No way to face our grinning fateCollision
In the whirlwind's eye
Decision
To lose all faith
Rejoicing
Consecrate the doom
The brooding
Of the serpent seed
Cold moon, fiery sun
Behold the sky
The feast has begun
The morning
Birds with beaks of stone
The drowning
Into the dance of rays
Universe
Constellations collapse
The lost verse
Of the inverse genesis
Cold moon, fiery sun
Behold the sky
The feast has begun
Betrayal...
You must purge your soul
The trial
By fire and virgin snow
Collision
In the heart of the world
Decision
To destroy to rise again(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Pure disease, a chasm of souls
parasites of endless things, in divinity's well
Infected with curses, the flames of God
Imperial races, Chaos Enthroned

Marvels like snails
a wheel of depression
Dehumanizing the shaded breed
 to zero and one

Generators of plague, never ending mind control
diagramming the spheres of the seashell
In the source of all evil, the ultimate devastation
A torrent of existence

Chaos Enthroned

The space is bleeding, with the hate from the race of Memes
universal prototypes, an open door to infinity
Insected with corpses, the apostolic wrath
Etherial crossing, Chaos Enthroned

Cyclones and storms
the last days of humanity
This corrosion in perfect design
to zero and one

The Action, Reaction, dementia like a maze
Creation, Corruption, the universe in haze
The balance, Imbalance, the edge of obscure realms
A zero, Subhero, the life of human breed

Chaos EnthronedI see your Pantera lines
I'm gettin' high
I'm free to be myself here
My system is all plugged up
And I can't shit
Pantera takes the stage
The girls, the coke, the rage
I'm shifting my weight around
I have 20 lbs. of shit stored up
But these people and I are one
Rockin' together
I'm uncomfortable but free!As part of a movie tie-in
Burger King offered a premium
A blackened coffin with a child's meal

You disturb the undead
You dig up the blackened coffin
The spirits call it murder
And will destroy the consumer

This imagery is beyond you mortals
Do not taunt these demons
Who lay rotting in blackened coffins
Waiting to get evenWill spring of human consciousness come ever?
Will dead consciences spontaneously revive?
Will only one real way out of a situation
Be a persuasion boring a breach of the
Human thoughts freedom
Will I live to see a better tomorrow?
Will I see a lights in the darkness?
Or maybe will I remain a wretched blind
Man for perpetvity?Weapons will be rise and will be destryed
For the age of the wind and the wolf
The war will last for three successive years
For the age of the wind and the wolf

The Age of the Ax
The Age of the Ax

Join your legions and fight for your old ideals
And you will see your death
In the last of the battles
While the siblings will tear your own bodies

Starry skies will be the scenery of the bloody age
Nor the most beautiful woman
The vampire Strigoi Stryx will survive
In the arms of Siren
I watch it

Our spotted flags
It will move above the hills
Winds blow perverse
From all the directions our total fury

Clouds of blood hover the valley
Screams and pain rivers reign forever

Axes will vomit an endless hate
Above the craniums in pieces.Cherish insanity, digression grinding 
The cogwheels of a cool eloquence lined with an undimensional joy 

Amusing ourselves to death 
Before reclaiming a lifeless life 

Subscribe to whose iconisms 
Rallied into a closed circuit 
Of dreams turned sour and then turned on themselves 

Exotic variations (of nothing) 
Can't think beyond conditioning 
Now stand at the end of life. 
The broken promise of wasted activity 

Endure this world without end in total silence.Lady moon...
Fairest of all...
Come back to me...He would make his bed, 
If he could sleep on it.

He would make his bed with white sheets
And disappear into the white,

Like a man diving,
If he could be certain

That the light
Would not keep him awake,

The light that reaches
To the bottom.These helices, models of my internal design. 
 Illustrate, color and shepherd my physical being. 
 My vessel. 
 My everything. 

 On a molecular level, I am as complex as any other. 
 We all share a frame of reference. 
 Nucleic acids, strands of pure information. 
 In search of all life's origin, unwinding the double helix. 

 Genes replicate, scripting one existence at a time. 
 Duplicate. Direct my composition. 
 Developed natural practice.

 Growing. (Resonating in us) 
 Shifting. (An ever-constant pulse) 
 Changing. (Inclusive and open) 
 Evolve. (This frequency does pull) 
 Adapt. (To deny connection) 
 Create. (Is not to separate) 
 Improve. (This is everlasting) 
 Perfect. (This bond is sarosanct) 

 The tree of life, once only a seed... 
 Of which I was the sower. 
 Is still but a mere sapling within an orchard of distinct eldership. 
 Much like a lantern on a window sill, left as a beacon, 
 I will always be here. Glowing, hopeful and forever-prompted. 

 Fiber based and carbon formed, of all the things I've felt before. 
 Nothing equates or can pacify more, 
 Than the answers I seek being washed to the shore. 
 As I relish the findings and bathe in the wealth, 
 Of the knowledge of gained about us. About self. 
 I am assured, substantiated, relieved. 
 That I am more than I've grown to believe. 

 The chain remains unsevered. 

 Prokaryotically, from whence we have come. 
 Genetically predisposed, radiated by the sun 

 Mathematically developing continuous strains of reality. 
 An elaborate procedure executed with surgical precision. 
 And through all of this... 
 Change will occur. 

 And our roots gather foul water; diluted nutrients. 
 Yet we wonder why we remain unripe.Endless days he spend in vain attempts to find his calling 
With the gaze that night absorbed 
Yet 

Like mournful soul hope that was killed was lost forever 
Was cradled was consoled by blackness 
Will heal never 

Tormenting wound that bears for ages my damnation 
Is being in heaven mourned in deep distress by angels 

Mighty Father help my to find my self 
So that I could see my predestination 

Torn to pieces, destroyed is his perception 
Hope is gone but he tries to find salvation 

The light of absolution hidden by the scales 
Of sufferings from his eyes shone warming his tired soul 
Exhausted by everlasting wanderings 
Blood did not warm the cold stone against my hope 
Search for fate was cut by death(Instrumental)Starry-eyed fools 
Sharing ideals 
Hoping to consruct new ways 

Blindfolded slaves 
Opressed by their thoughts 
The King OF PANDAS controlling them 

A giant cuddly bear 
Blood dripping from its hands 
Smashing the skulls of rebels 
Yeah lets dance dance dance 

I just want to scream out 

Oh its all in vain 
Making the world green 
Won't happen today 
Nuclear is bad 
So let's burn more coal 
And tell everyone 
That we are saving them 

Mouthy idiots 
Blapping about 
Saving the squirrels and flies 

Fundamentalist 
Opening cages 
Rejoicing freedom when fluffy things dieI am your captain follow me to the gates of Hell 
Battle beckons at the River Somme where corpses swell 

River of blood flow over me 
Show me the beauty of Death 
Fallen Angels teach me your secrets 
Show me forbidden ways 

All that I asked for was given to me 
In a gold plated puzzle box, lovely to see 
I fondled each feature, it began to transform 
When secret portals to the darkness were born 

(The suffering of strangers, the agony of friends 
There is a secret song at the center of the world 
and its sound is like razors through flesh!) 

Oh, what pleasure, delicious pain! 
To the brink and far beyond 
As I felt the nails sink deep into my skull 
Memories of former days were gone 

I rose to a new position, the High Priest of Hell! 

A foul cry molests the air as the demon roams the earth 
The puzzle box a seductive snare for the man who seeks his worth 
The Lamentation Configuration sends its message to all 
A young rogue by the name of Frank received its lovely call 

"We bid you welcome! Come know the joys of Hell!" 

(Pater noster, qui es in Inferis ritibus nomen tuum 
Et priapo est, de scorto sugit nectar 
Ex tumore pulsans malleus hominem 
Virgo in utero ejus nubilem ac discerptum, 
Dolens prava in ecstasim!) 

Larry loves Julia but Julia loves Frank 
She longs to feel his manly touch 
The blood of victims brings him back to her 

Lovely and young, fresh as the dawn 
Kirsty arrives to comfort her father 

She never trusted Julia 
Cold and distant, Julia 
Not like her mother, Julia 
Hurting her father, Julia 
Loving another, Julia 
Daddy's own brother, Julia 
Where are you going? 
Julia, what are you doing? 

Kirsty opened the puzzle box 
Cenobites arrived 
They long to show her the joys of Hell 
She wants to stay alive 

Come Mr. Hell Priest, have I got a deal for you 
Someone escaped your torment 
A degenerate deviant, I can lead you straight to him 
So take him back to Hell!(Instrumental)You sound so tired these days
When the weight of the world
Sits on your shoulders
And it's awfully hard to keep
Keep your eyes open
So you look past the stars
Through the nightmare sky
And you wonder if it's true

Would things be any different
If there really was a man
A man in the moon

And the pressure's so strong now
You just want to cry
But the tears you shed
Would just rust your eyes
And it's awfully hard to keep
Keep your eyes open
So you look past the stars
Through the nightmare sky
And you wonder if it's true

Would things be any different
If there really was a man
A man in the moonGens ista avia et secreta habitat,

It spreads, like a disease. 

The noise inside my head. 
It batters. It never ends. 

This pain, it never rests. 
It spreads. It conquers my mind. 

The pain inside my head. 
It tingles. It never rests. 

I'm being hunted! 
I'm being mocked! 
I'm the enemy! 
I'm the prey! 

I am hated to death! 
I am scarred to death! 
I am left out here to die! 
Listen! Here they come again! 

The earth shatters before my eyes. 
The ground opens. 
Then the gap's gone again. 

The wind takes me away. 
Trees bend to break. 

The fear. It is excruciating. 
A fear that won't go away. 

The loneliness. It is shattering. 
I'm broken. I cannot hold. 

All light has been taken away from me. 
I am lost. I am done. 
All has given up on me. 
I run alone. I hide alone. 
All hope is gone. 
All hope is gone! 

I fall. I drown. I shout! In darkness. 
I raise my hands to the moon! 

I whisper. I beg. I cry! In silence. 
I raise my voice to the This is the culture you will never know
Of wicked faces, tube will never show

Strikes forth yet again

I'll spit upon as you fall
But not before the maiming

Paint pictures with your blood.Clash of steel,burning down
Dripping gore,heaven bound
Fallen cross of blooded bronze
Choking smoke of cloven earth

And the lies of god will never
Chain me
Not me

Believe or die
And the kings of the earth will mourn

You'll wish you'd never been born

Get drunk on the blood of peace

Restless in the night
Streets are quiet
Evil kept out of light
The beast cease to rest
As there is smell of fear
Savage attacks will go on
Morbid howls you still hear
Secret passages we use
And crawl behind your back
Deformed souls of hell
All compassion we lack... lack!

From chambers and cellars
From the gutter and the grave
Transformation of the wicked
Feel no love just pure hate
We appear from the darkness
And gather in the fog
In an animal form
One wolf and a dozen dogs
To worship the devil
Is the call to obey
To hunt down the meek
For the meek shall pay
These are no disguises
We don't wear no mask
This is our real face
How we go for our task

The mission is set
With the oath by the fire
Dealing satanic death
Rising higher and higher
Gateways and alleys
To new ends of the earth
Whores are the mothers
Who ever gave birth
These are no disguises
We don't wear no mask
This is our real face
How we go for our task
We cannot be killed
For we are already dead
With endless thirst
When there's no blood to shedBlack holes in the sky! 
I see my face on the sun. 
I see my soul among the stars. 
And I fly. 

This vivid insane whisper 
(It) follows each hazy step I make. 
It comes in solid shapes. 
And as an aura it goes. 

I have denied. 
Everything. 
For it, 
Even my life. 
I will be crucified, 
For it. 

I am your saviour. 
I am a messiah. 

Listen to me! 
If the light takes us, 
whom are you going to betray? 

Listen to me! 
Whom are you going to blame, 
If the darkness is upon us? 

Whom will you betray? 
Whom will you blame? 
When it is judgement time! 
When everything falls apart! 

Which side will you pick? 
Which disease will you spread? 
When it is time for war! 
When everything falls apart! 

Whom will you betray? 
Whom will you blame? 
When it is judgement time! 
When everything falls apart! 

Which side will you pick? 
Which disease will you spread? 
When it is time for war! 
When everything falls apart! 

If the light takes us. 
Or. 
If the darkness takes us 
Prepare. 
You will be alone. 
You live as you dream. 
Alone.(Instrumental)Bow down before No One
worship No one
I will not bow down
I am a god

worship no one
bow before no one
answer
i will not answer to no one..Look into my eyes and lay your door ajar
I'll force my twisted soul in yours
stare into my face, watch the world as it falls from grace
but proud and solemn, I'm soulless

I am sick, guilty, I'm the father of all sin
all I've done and seen
the filth, a curse, I'm the walking scream

I break the seals and no secrets dwell or live
I'm the holy beast undone
that what's wrong

I'm the filth divine

Ask me for answers you'll never dare to hear
and I'll break my silence, my sworn silence
a pain in your ears
But no, don't look at me with your angel eyes
I'll make you blind
I'm the dark, the light in black

Look into my eyes, I'll make you blind
my twisted soul
the father of all done and seen
the light in black, the walking scream

Look into my eyes and lay your door ajar
I'll force my twisted soul in yours

The doors of perception will open and close
Hope will exist in a problematic relationship with reason
Libidinal energy will whirl round like a rattle rattling
Hearts will be stopped bones will shatter shattering

Hoping to gradually fill the glass

The time has come, 
For me to leave this mortal existence 
My mind is cleared by visions of exalation 
The silence of infinte space 

Mechanised drifting, 
An elegant movement 
Never colliding, 
Those great speheres of light 

Mo more waiting, 
My final deed is done 
My soul is drifiting into space 
Behold the rays of our sun, 
Are but tears in the flood yet to come 

"This I cannot comprehend, 
my feelings, the ovwerwhelm my soul..." 

So I come to face destiny, 
My place among the stars 
Mesmerised by blackness, 
In my capsule of thought 
I drift eternally...I don't know why i'm here but i woke up 
And she was staring at the corner of the room 
There's no way out 
From the witch house 
This place is scary as fuck 
She's coming closer 
Before the sunlight comes 
She will hold my head 
There's no way out 
From the witch houseFeel the time, touch the air
Glide through the skies of sorrow & dispair

Searching for illusions
To govern my mind
Floating through eternal space
The black hole of mankind

See the dead, living in disguise
Threatening deceptions, visions in my eyes.

Creating my illusions
Subjected to this kaos
Images of another place
Lost faith in these times

Flee this space, voyage of demise
Returning from my karma, wider frame of mind

Mind Glide - Mind Glider(Instrumental)You have a feeling that you ahve
lived a lot-but you do n ot
want to die-you do not find yourself
You may have never feared.

Only the strong survives
Everyonedies who is coward
There is hate burning in your eyes
You do not have to be encouraged
You kill!

There is revenge seething in your head
The anger has already, blinded you
You only think of today
Through your blood is already debauched!

Darker side!

Each day is an anguish
By day you skulk, at night you live
You trample the weaker an the foot
This worls is yours.

You have  a feelings that you you have 
Lived a lot.Prepare for the battle!
The enemy approaches!
In this perilous journey, shields shatter; minds shatter...

The battle has been won...
There are none who can stand against us...
We come with fire and metal...
We come for thee..
The battle is at your doorstep...
We come for thee...

Hey!

We come with fire and metal...
We come for thee...

Unsheathe my sword!
Unsheathe my sword upon you this day!
Unsheathe my sword upon you!
Pierce your flesh!
With fire and thunderstorms!
With fire and thunder!Walk in silence,
Don't walk away, in silence.
See the danger,
Always danger,
Endless talking,
Life rebuilding,
Don't walk away.

Walk in silence,
Don't turn away, in silence.
Your confusion,
My illusion,
Worn like a mask of self-hate,
Confronts and then dies.
Don't walk away.

People like you find it easy,
Naked to see,
Walking on air.
Hunting by the rivers,
Through the streets,
Every corner abandoned too soon,
Set down with due care.
Don't walk away, in silence,
Don't walk away.Slowly - everything is quiet
There seems to be gray
I can barely feel me
Restless i am

All feels so hollow
I am afraid to leave you

Has my journey began
But then, what happens then
Is all really done
What if i am gone

Do i go now
I can't let go

A warm white light and some
Deep voices told me: come

Now i've finally arrived
An everythings is quiet
I have it hard won
And eveything is done

Now I am gone
I left you I left you now(Instrumental)Cheese is good!On your trail Almighty ghost
Spiritual trust with both eyes closed
As we arrive upon the hill
He holds up his hands to show our good will

We made it through the giant gate
Expecting a welcome
Dear brothers of faith
Not faces pointing down at the ground
Silently without any sound

Was it him?
The one we are supposed to honour
Was it him?
The one who was above all others
About his words you better not twist
It is up to yourself if you choose to exist

All that the prime priest took
Can be returned by the book
The book has been hidden for ages

Living to die...learning to forget...
to feel suffering!
THIS is our essence, this is our life...
Or is it just a lie?...
We are born in sin. They're pushing us to live.
In this way, Without knowing the reasons,
Without knowing "why".
(i'm) alone against the world... a world full of therror
We are empty souls, we are wasting, wasting
our time...

-CHORUS-: We are just a Human Waste
creators of the pain we feel inside our brain
Vain fool (-full-) of human waste!

It's the moment to change the rules, don't continue
running without direction, Don't be affraid...
Because the destiny of humanity is in your fucking hands
The opportunity is presented just once in a life...
Don't be affraind (2) because the destiny of humanity
is in your fucking hands...enjoy your life without limits
-DON'T BE AFFRAID-I think we should throw in some of my, doodoodododooddoo's!

- REMNANTS Lyrics by Michael Gee.My army advances through the ruins
The sky is turning black and death is our seal
The enemy's hiding - my armour is so cold
I feel the smell of blood - I hear the noise of swords
The flags of horde appear and battle begins
Fire fills the sky and thousand of arrows fly
On battlefield my army defeats the enemy
I carry thy black flag on land of victoryOh you
Who appears as mine
Disappears
Without a trace
Of anything
And leaves me stranded

Packed up your things
Presumed dead
No warnings and no signs
I loved you
So this must mean
Goodbye...

But no-one knows
The truth
I won't reveal
As I stood on that hardwood floor
Laughing inside
While you decayed beneath me

Under that hardwood floor
With that stupid, tortured
Look on your face
Laughing back at me
But at least my smile
Is filled with teeth

Covering your broken face
In both blood and cum
Bash in your lying eyes
For the second time

Angel with ripped off wings
Now a bleeding disgrace
And if I was ever to care
Now is NOT the time...HUNGRY!!

In the house where the mad man resides
Darkness - Shadows
Seven stiffs beneath the floor lie
Torsos - Bodies
Dire smell form the dead below
Sour blood - Putrid feet
But what to sell when the budget is low
MAN FLESH - MAN FLESH!

Dead and gone - Flesh for the public
Eye by eye - Sold in chocolate
Lung by lung - in fine pulp lies
Stand in line - For the gore inside

Skin made gloves
Blood sausage
Nails as chips

Bowels soup
Fresh baked tooth
Tongue in bun

Dead and gone - Flesh for the public
Eye by eye - Sold in chocolate
Hair by hair - In toothbrush lies
Stand in line - For the gore inside

Dead and gone - Flesh for the public
Eye by eye - Sold in chocolate
Breast by breast - Blended with rice
Stand in line - For the gore inside

10 new recruits in my fast food chain

Cook them - Fry them!(Instrumental)and God saw
the wickedness of man
man had become
full of evil
it repented the Lord
that He had made man
and it grieved Him
in His heart

and God said unto Noah
"the end of all flesh is come before Me
for the earth is filled with violence through them
I will destroy them with the earth
make thee and ark of gopher wood"
and Noah did at God's command

and it came to pass
after seven days
the waters
were upon the earth

and all the flesh - died that moved
upon the earth - both of fowl
and of cattle - and of beast
every creeping - thing and man

every living 
substance
was destroyed
which was upon
the face of the ground

the waters prevailed
upon the earth
a hundred and
fifty daysNow these days will be rewritten, all today's children will be cast away, all the people of praise and their animals slain and blood drunk by the clay. Are you the new-born? The soul without sin? Your silent lies, the reveal you... Seeking destruction under these stars, all the marks and symbols are stagnant. My sword can find you despite your saviour, dying, lying, procreating or pregnant? Are you the new-born? The soul without sin? My hate and open hand, now clenched to the fist... This point of light is a helpless witness of uncreation, of death of life. And the truth which burns all lies will come forth like a doom in the sky... Are you the new-born? The soul without sin? My hate and open hand, now clenched to the fist...Ramai orang berkumpul di halaman kotaku. 
Bergaduh lah mereka. Gaduhlah!

Bangitkan semangat, janjikan kemenangan

Rusuhan, kemarahan.
Nafsu engkau yang menjijikan 
terlukis pada wajah kau,
Jangan meragu, menyimpang dari agama. 
Jangan berkompromi
Menyimpang dari kewarasan
Langsung tiada kompromi! 

Kebodohan manusia inilah menunjukkan betapa bodohnya Tuhan.(Instrumental)My breath gets cold
Again I run from you
This is our fate
Snow covers everything
But not these tears of farewell

Painful and deep
Like a scar within us
Which will never heal
And while I go away
A shadow with me
A part of your souls's with me

In life freedom has an high price
Everytime my heart
Is wrapped by darkness

One day I'll return my dear
I promise yout hat it will be forever

Our eyes closing on a promise
That one day we'll be free
To breath together foreverOne definite progress meter
built up by the burden of strain.
Uncyclical infinity,
eternal journey to the yet unknown.

Nothing is so complicated:
when it's done, it's done.
A sentence cannot describe
the will to keep moving on.

I just take this strange continuum,
leaving all my peers bemused and clueless.
Have I changed, have I gone insane?
Even past is haunting me,
I have no time to turn around.

As mysterious as the universe itself,
my reveal is also my secrecy.
Everything is relative to the other,
issues that will never ever be solved.

At the end of the day we would realize
we can never expand our time in space.The richest people from the woeld,
They'd like to decree without us.
Prague, Rome and Los Angeles
were places of the summits.

Is this planet for the rich only?
Why does only one side arbitrate?

Where are the representatives
of the other people and communities?
It's a scorn on humanity.
Nobody wants to listen to the
voice of the habitants of this star.

Strikes and disagreements.
Fights and disturbances.
Blood and barricades.
Flames and broken glass.

We want to speak about our lives
will you listen to us?
So kill us! Kill us! Kill us!
You've a lot of money for guns.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Man is like a crow on the grave
Without movement or sound
The silence required by the tomb
Peace created by the void

The eyes reflect from the walls
Sharp and full of despair
The corners of a mouth
Hanging down like black hair

This man doesn't ask for a dance
His power is in silence
All energy aimed at the soul
A wicked soul!

Stained by the fears of this world
Transformed into a great lion
Fangs hunger for relief
Blood and chaos

The key is in silence
Without silence the beast is free
Shelters crushed in the wind
A wind of knives and grief

Return to your shell
Return to your hell
You are like a crow
On the grave(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Nor a brother's keeper, nor a mother's son
equilibrist
walking the hyphen between ludicity, with neurosis six feet underneath
contortionist
twisting between wind and serosity, gifted chosen remnants of the golden
mean
I the martyr, the hero, the sage, bringer of beauty and truth in my wake
I the shadow, the leveler, the end bearer of envy and greed in my trail
my will be done
this duality, coalescnt counterparts
this binary converging
why? the purpose of existence
what? the nature of reality
no
obey
caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
the storm is coming
stop
never
pallbearers rake ove the ashes at the eleventh hour
our savior, time is up
redeem us from the kingdom of bane
deadened soul speaks no more
callous heart beats forlorn
I fear for all I love I left behind
these voices, they made me do it
a Thousand eyes are lurking, as the mute are leading the blind(Instrumental)(Instrumental)You say you don't wanna run and hide
A face that no-one knows
And everyone ya meet, you're gonna show
You're nobody's slave, nobody's chains are holdin' you
You hold your fist up high,
And rule the zoo

Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody......to cry out

I wanna be somebody,
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too

You say you don't wanna starve
Or take the table crumbs that fall
You don't wanna beg or plead at all
You don't want no nine to five
Your fingers to the bone
You don't want the rock piles' bloody stones

Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody.....to cry out

I wanna be somebody,
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too

I want shiny cars and dirty money
Lotsa rock and roll
I will live in fame and die in flames
I'm never gettin' old

I wanna be somebody,
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too

I'm gonna be somebody,
I'm gonna be somebodyStalwart Lair Wurm
A new challenge
For an old blade

Bleeding White
Imbues colors
On a world of Night

Solar Winter cross
It guards
As I take aim
Hades sighs
Makes He LOX rain
Worlds collapse
Into One

A Mercury Planet
A sea of Orange
A sky of Death

An overwhelming presence seeks me
Watches me paw through the air like I was insane
I can feel them shudder and stare in disgust
But I know I have reached a great Holy Place
I touch a pair of fiery green eyes
As the fire consumes my body, my mind becomes clear yet distant
Burdened and Illuminated

Fall on
Void dust fields
Perception fails
Falling through

Outside
Unnerving Pain
One Hour
No WordsRotten rotten rotten
Flipping rotten pancakes
Serving salmonella
Smiling winking service
Doctors like the pancake
They like the silver money
The cakes are two dollars

Rotten rotten rotten
Flipping cakes with discolor
To serve to hungry patrons
The dyrup hides the spoiling
That made their stomachs die
And fall out of human bodies
Leaving angry people
Who cannot eat spring of mintThe time has come for us to make infernal dreams reality
And turn the world into a funeral pyre
The gates of Hell are open
Filling hearts and minds with hope
The time has come to cleanse the world with fire
Television angels falling,
There's a revelation calling
This world will never be the same
No more false prophets preaching
An end to all the lies they're teaching
Everything is going up in flames

Synagogues and churches is burning
Can't you see the tide is turning?
How many fires will it take?
Before you realize that god is dead
Until you open up your eyes and see your god is dead

God is dead...Satan lives!
God is dead...Satan lives!

This is the new Way...Hail Hellfire!
This is the new Age...Hail Satan!
This is the age of lust and dark desire
It's the age of anger, it's the Age of Fire

Burn! Burn, baby, burn! Burn! Burn, baby, burn!

And the pulpit of lies is crumbling now
As the puppets of Christ come tumbling down
Let the fire in our hearts become a fire in our minds
And let our minds light fires among all mankind

Burn! Burn, baby, burn! Burn! Burn, baby, burn!Pushed to the wall
Then one stroke after another
Living in submission against your will
Spoil the dream of demokracy to those in power
Fight of survival tights up your hands.
Do only whatcha want - fuck what they say.
Resposebility adn conscience are like handcuffs.
And if you don't get rid off it you will die hand cuffed.
Fight of survival tights up your hands.
Do only whatcha want - fuck what they say.
If you wanna stay alive -you gotta save yourself
Get away with what you got and care just for yourself
Don't be a prisoner of society where those in power
Don't give a flying about you.I prefer feeding myself with dead flesh,
Cutting up pieces of body,
Hearing long and deep screams of agony
From my victims, so bloody get apart.

Men, women , olders and children,
I don't like better, one or the others,
Cleaned up, skin off and guts out :
All we need is a treamendous meal

TESTICULARBURGER!

Testicularburger, a genital organ eater,
Testicularburger, a very deranged killer

My wet hands are petting bodies purified by death
Brightening fire is appearing in my enjoyed eyes,
When a beautifull explosion is now going out...
Endless, great objects of desire are now coming...

Out from the body!

Testicularburger, a genital organ eater,
Testicularburger, a very deranged killer

Balls are toasting in a slow fire,
Delicious smell is inviding the air,
Flesh is grilling on another pan,
Just great to wrap testicularburger

TESTICULARBURGER!(Instrumental)Rome wasn't built in a day
But it didn't take long to go up in flames
Fire is a beautiful thing
A gift that fallen angels bring
We will set your soul on fire
Feed the flames of your desire

Burn your cities to the ground
Bring the heavens crashing down with...

HELLFIRE!

Our father who art in Hell
Hallowed be thy name
Give us the power to purify
And cleanse the world with flame

We will set your soul on fire
Feed the flames of your desire
Fire is a beautiful thing
A gift that fallen angels bring...Putrefaction
A scent that cursed be
Under coat of dust
From the darkness
Rise a succubus
From the earthen rust

Haresis dea
Once a majesty
Now exposing bone
From the darkness
Rise as succubus
And usurp the throne

The moon is full and shines
An evil blinding light
Under a monolith, her likeness
Marble white

Ghuleh... Ghuleh...You corrupt, You enslave
Enforced taboos, to the grave
Make me right, to fit your mould
Make me right, like your moral code

You distort, You destroy
You own, You lie
Make us follow, like the sheep we are
Make us follow, we need to believewhat if my life is a one way story
what if my time is a one last chance
if every moment is pre-decided
every day will complete your life

killing the sense of a sacred story
wasting your time with a senseless fight
life is a game with a moving target
truth is a place wich is hard to find

You follow a thousand ways - where do you go ?
Minds focused on the human scale fail to see all

oh, how can you be so sure
about your destination
oh, how can you smile
when the leafs are falling

Time - passes with the speed of light - shadows on you
In spite of the the world we know - we fail to see all

knowing the things I don`t want to follow
is taking me to an adventural place
There is a siren that keeps me fighting
will you take care of your one last life?

You follow a thousand ways - where do you go ?
You walk into the strange unknown - fail to see all(Instrumental)(Instrumental)"I don't have to be psychic to see that you're in a very dark place."

We're not so blindThis is my body
my sacrifice to you
this is my blood
which shall be shed for your sins
i have come to be the light of the world
not to judge but to save all of you

As darkness sets, 
the agony begins
one of you will betray me with a kiss of death
pray that you may not enter into temptation
God gives me strength, I`m going to be crucified

A crown of thorns
and disgraced by scourge
I took up my cross
had to carry it to the skull
do not weep for me, but for you
and your children
Father forgive them for they know not what they do.
Why did we turn our backs on him
how could we let it happen
just stood and stared at the man on the cross
the time will come when we must face life alone.

You got to make up your mind
for what you know is right
let`s not be another face in the crowd
we can do it together

Let us pray
for those who crucify - christ have mercy
for fools who follow fools - christ have mercy
for those who walk in darkness - christ have mercy
and for all of you - Christ will come again.ANGEL OF LIGHT,FATHER OF LIES

Like galaxies receding
All I see
Is water and the horizon
No habitat within reach
I gaze longingly into the sun
And the random colors
Of perpetual hibernation
This final second
This state of nirvana
You see in my marble impassive eyes
Snowball earth
Come visit us once again
Supplant this fallacy
So our bodies can rest
In coffins of ice
Feeding the sediment
I laugh at your remorse
One last time
Before my mind turns numb
The worms are chewing
On my organs

Nobody knows the song they recorded
Nobody felt their madness

Sad but proud till the endShow me a hell that I've never seen before 
A thousand lost souls, begging for more 
Sky cast black, clouds turn to gray 
Waiting for this moment in total decay 
Scenes from a book of lies we all thought untrue 
Face to face with the beast you change your point of view 
Head dipped to one side, creature from the deep 
Devouring lives, my soul he's gonna reap 

Waves crashing all around, the tide is rising high 
A bellowing horn, I know I'm gonna die 

The pressure is true, my only desire 
A satanic ritual of funeral fire 

Sign of the serpent, in total unrest 
Casting my shadow in the west 
Spawned from hatred, created by fear 
Visions of your death, drawing ever near 
A love violence, what a thrill 
I'm never gonna stop, until I've killed 
A different kind of insanity, trapped in a cage 
Plague of this earth filled with rage 

Waves crashing all around, the tide is rising high 
A bellowing horn, I know I'm gonna dieMost people look anywhere but down, and yet you like to look down, and converse with people about below. People tell you not to look down and concentrate on the climb alone, yet you feel the need to know where you are going. Some suggest looking up instead, but you think it is pointless, thinking that is not where you are headed, and it hurts your eyes for nothing and renders you incapable of even seeing the rope. Yet people tell you not to look down. Some jump off, thinking it is where they are going anyway. Most try to enjoy this climb, yet you try to ask people about below. Some claim it is going to be white like above, some claim the climb will restart in another rope and yet you know nobody knows, and they get uncomfortable when you ask.(Instrumental)The descent from the vault
shows itself to be infinite
Transcendent and complete
revealed an attribute of divinity

Sidereal zones of waste
another one garden of silent guilt
Religious supremacy sense
the land of gnosis under the human beliefs
The shining orb of the moon,
the human race and the wild beasts
by earthly limbs and flesh
This fusion mass brings the world to birth

When everything has been tried in vain,
like the storm of modern duality
Marching in existence
the whole heaven shouts and shakes
The mankind was born of the waters
now it's time to return in flames
The stars are set beyond death
and heaven looked upwards for the human race.

Nailed in centuries, the fall of crest and crown
for all the fires are dim, our souls are still in bounds
And through all varied smoke and cries, the roaring of the sun,
The noise of little lives and brave, reflects the steps so far

Doom and Hope
Denial and Fate
Regret and Return
Hail! Hail! [2x]

In a cosmic reflection, immortals we will be
against the laws of gravity, we climbed and disappeared

Nailed in centuries, the fall of crest and crown
for all the fires are dim, our souls are still in bounds
And through all varied smoke and cries, the roaring of the sun,
The noise of little lives and brave, reflects the steps so far

"Some are hung splayed out, exposed to the empty winds,
some are plunged in the rushing floods - their stains,
their crimes scoured off or scorched away by fire.
Each of us must suffer his own demanding ghost.
Then we are sent to Elysium's broad expanse,
a few of us even hold these fields of joy till the long days,
a cycle of time seen through, cleanse our hard,
inveterate stains and leave us clear ethereal sense,
the eternal breath of fire purged and pure.
But all the rest, once they have turned the wheel of time for a thousand years:
God calls them forth to the Lethe, great armies of souls,
their memories blank so that they may revisit the overarching world once more
and begin to long to return to bodies yet again."

I hurt him in his holy heart, and break his wings

My Guardian Angel forgive me for all
I'm killing and tormenting our crying soul
I'm evil, a sinful man in all this world

But one day I'll take my cross and go to a shameful death
Alone, alone with us is our holy faith

"What has been will be again,
what has been done will be done again" (Ec. 1:9)

I got dirty in the mud, I want to be free
And in my soul became dark, I want to be healed
My angel saw the light that shone forth in me
He stopped crying and came back to be with me

My Guardian Angel forgive me for all
I'm killing and tormenting our crying soul
I'm evil, a sinful man in all this world
Embrace me, support me, I don't want to fall

But one day I'll take my cross and go to a shameful death
Alone, alone with us is our holy faith

"What has been will be again,
what has been done will be done again" (Ec. 1:9)

"Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless" (Ec. 1:2)

But one day I'll take my cross and go to a shameful death
Alone, alone with us is our holy faithThere's something inside me 
It's, it's coming out 
I feel like killing you 
Let loose the anger, held back too long 
My blood runs cold 
Through my anatomy, dwells another being 
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding 
Brutality now becomes my appetite 
Violence is now a way of life 
The sledge my tool to torture 
As it pounds down on your forehead 
Eyes bulging from their sockets 
With every swing of my mallet 
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in 
through the cracks, blood does leak 
distorted beauty, catastrophe 
Steaming slop, splattered all over me 
Lifeless body, slouching dead lecherous abcess, where you once had a head 
Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust 
You will never live again, soon your life will end 
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face 
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half 
Crushing, cranial, contents 
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes 
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised 
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon 
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions 
Suffer, and then you die 
Torture, pulverized 
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free 
To kill as I please, no one can stop me 
Created to kill, the carnage continues 
Violently reshaping human facial tissue 
Brutality becomes my appetite 
Violence is now a way of life 
The sledge my tool to torture 
As it pounds down on your foreheadHey now!
Let's make it clear
It's all about love, all about joy
Reproduction and ways to get high

Hell yeah!
Let's make it even clearer
When bass drum kicks too sallow
Animalside takes all control

Know what's in your mind - Know what's inside
Kid you're feeling pale - tell us of your hate
Know what's in your mind - what's in your fucking mind!?!!
It goes
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

I should know what's inside
But I don't mind I just wanna stay high
Every time this world turns shit anew
Someone finds new way to kill it too
Rock on!

Hell yeah!
Let's make it fuckin' clear
When bass drum kicks too sallow
Animalside takes all control
When whiskey tastes like red wine
Someone's way too goddamn high
Rock on mo'fo!

That's the way a-ha now shake that ass yeah tits and coke!The Neo-Con agenda will leave this world in ruins 
Consolidate financial empires (under the guise of the) 
War on terrorism 
Axes of EvilI was born in the place of the fear
with all the difference surrounding me
The only knowledge I got was so dark
"Satan is the only Lord", they said

Lived in darkness, served the serpent 
Nothing that's good I had to follow
Committed all crimes, "do what thou wilt" 
Something evil stored inside my head

Rose from the ashes of confusion
I did not know what the truth's about
For this I was charged of being guilty 
of all crimes against humanity

Something happened within my life
In my darkest hour, came to me
the light of Christ, real divine love
I felt ashamed of all I have done

Forgiveness I found, He gave me a new life
Knowledge of the truth open up inside
The devil might steal my youth away,
but now he cannot stop my will to be free

Satan never fulfilled his promise to me
He just invert all the truth
Now I have a chance to live eternally
In Christ, my soul has been freedNight-shining shapes light-denying rape
Extraterrestrials... and rogue meteors
Unintentionally... bend vogue wars
Out of control: marked passive
And on a mission
Great amounts of heavy metals
Decode without any unsettle
How it evolved as this unraveled
Hit a stellar wall and erupt in travel
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of controlAin't nothing to eat
Ain't nowhere to stay
Ain't strenght to wake up
Ain't nobody around.
Luxurious cars and huge estates
Swimming pools and cheerful faces
Full stomaches and safes packed to the top
And no conscience...and...bloody hands!
Scent of grill and stink of trashcans
Shiny cars and filthy rags
Baroque music and ultimate heartbeat
Joy, happiness - sadness
Laughter - cry
Live - die
Is this the beautiful life?
Is this the world of justice?(Instrumental)Flowers...Be My Eyes, You, New Reality

Welcome to this endless nightmare 
You can't escape 
Darkness begins to consume you 
Succumb to fate 
Eternities of endless torture 
Won't compare to this 
This is a one time show 
You won't miss 

This isn't easy, I hope you know 
The misery will not let go 

I'll endure 
Run no more 
Win the war 
And I'll 
Haunt your dreams 
Fill your screams 
Bow to me 

Close your eyes, let the fear sink in 
Embrace your doom 
Sit down and stay for a while 
Why leave so soon 
When I am through with you 
You'll wish for death 
My name will forever haunt 
Your every breath 

This isn't easy, I hope you know 
The misery will not let go 

I'll endure 
Run no more 
Win this war 
And I'll 
Haunt your dreams 
Fill your screams 
Bow to Me 

Oh god, what have I done? 
I have no soul 
The monster inside has awoken 
And taken control 
What to do with this guilt 
I haven't a clue 
Forgive me for I know not 
What I do

bin auf der Suche nach der Stille, 
doch fehlt mir der inn're Wille,
wenn ich erschein', so ist es mit der Ruhe aus. 

Ich eile immer schneller, greller wird mein Schein,
was ich nun sehe und erlebe, (ich) erbebe, ist mein Sein! 

Ich sehe Zank . . . Neid, 
erlebe inn're Einsamkeit,
bekannt sind Mord und Selbstmord mir,
an Stell' von Ehrbarkeit steht Selbsthort hier. 

Bin auf der Suche nach der Stille,
mich zu finden ist mein Wille!I kissed her goodbye, 
Although much has been left to be desired 
Forgive me for everything I'll do, 
It's all about pain, my betrothed 

Murdered the innocence 
Lost what used to be my mind 
Gone beyond my world 
Got rid of what we cherished 

Cherished... cherished... 
Loved you in torture 
Cherished... 
Crowned myself a leper 

Cherished... cherished... 
Loved you in torture 
Cherished... 
Crowned myself a leper 

This is my final waltz 
If I'd (only) thought of what it may end in! 
Forget me and everything I've done 
... this is my private pain 

Lying here, (motionlessly) passing away 
A disfigured heart... a condemned soul... 
Wiped out from inside, lovelorn 
A cripple man... a cripple man... 
... this is meI have seen a thousand dreams
believe me they were real
I have touched the skys in foreign lands
It seemed as if they were friends of mine
Do they belong to me ?

I made my days with hands embraced
While shadows cover the way I go
To get the choice to choose my place
Reminds me of what my father said :
"You don`t belong to me"
Do I belong somewhere at all ?

How many roads how many dreams
Led into the night ?
It`s getting so hard to find!
End of a mile - the start of a new
No one is immune
To the longing for other lands
It`s an odyssey it`s my own desire
Do I have roots to return to ?

Certain skys and secret ways
All the things we don`t understand
We waste our lives and sell our dreams
but were we do belong I don`t know
Do they belong to me ?

How many roads how many dreams
Led into the night ?
It`s getting so hard to find!
End of a mile - the start of a new
No one is immune
To the longing for other lands
It`s an odyssey it`s my own desire
Tell me where I do belong ...

How many roads how many dreams
Discover the truth and bury the lies
It`s not the same to be where your roots are
Or just anywhereVERY BIZZARE YOUR LINEAGE 
IN FORGOTTEN NIGHT OF ETERNITY
OMINOUS ICE IN THOUSAND OF NEEDLES
AND BLAZING EMBERS OF REBELIOUS EARTH

YOU'RE TOWERING INDIFFERENTLY OVER THE WORLD
NO MELODY CAN TOUCH YOUR PRIDE
SNOWY FEATHER IS A MEANINGFUL CROWN
TEMPERING STONE IS AN IMPREGNABLE THRONE

YOU RARELY OPEN PRIVATE GATES
SPARSE MEN HAVE SEEN YOUR MYSTIC FACE
YOU PREFER TO SING TRAGEDY TO PILGRIMS
AND TO COVER WOMB WITH COLLECTIVE GRAVEWell I just want to know if
Something could come early
Like a sunshine drop, like a ray of tear
Or simply like a cloud of hope
Cherish by those who wants to feel it
But there is something you should know
Other the stars, through your look in the sky
Another one might wanted to know if
You know, you are insane or not
Come down, earlier to show me that
You deserve to feed my questions
Mister enigma
Don't you want to introduce me your culture
It's interesting to know if
Something could come early
Like a sunshine drop, like a ray of tear
Or simply like a cloud of hope
Cherish by those who wants to feel it
You bloody know the meaning of this non-sense
It simply means that, The craziness hijack my brain
My loneliness, my ,oh, fuck it!
But there is something you should know
Other the stars, through your look in the sky
Another one might wanted to know if
You know, you are insane or not
Come down, earlier to show me that
You deserve to feed my questions
Mister enigma
Don't you wants to introduce me your culture
It's interesting to know if
Something could come early
Like a sunshine drop, like a ray of tear
Or simply like a cloud of hope
Cherish by those wants to feel it
You bloody know the meaning of this non-sense
It simply means that
The craziness hijack my brain
My loneliness, my, oh, fuck it!A single red orb dives behind the vast blue velvet
Fragments that have been cracked/ torn since innocence
Old hands are making sure of the deteoration of the world
Assuring that the human race goes into rural silences
- in a profound, elegant, sick way.

We can scarcely distinguish between reality, lie, dream and truths -
We find ourselves too incompetent to do
Something necessary - it has ended in cruelty.

Unstuck in time.

Celebrating by clapping their frustrated hands
We find it putrid - we do not even have a meek faith
in passion - we have been sedated
They are happy that we are only issued dazed
Wanderers - a collective congregation.

Livid sunset - array of scarlet clouds
A single red orb descending into autumn greyness
There is no reason in you wearing a dead man's clothes
The world turning grey as the orb descends
I am living in a clay pit - clenched pressure
Insignificant atom in an earthenware dish
I am suffering a chronic dumbfoundness
I inherit a smaller legacy - my only chance to escape
From the grim imprisoned life - it is marked as my destiny
Moving towards a solution - uncompromising as if it was inspired
by love - a new inventive iteration.

I am restraining myself
My savage affections roar in my head
Consisting a present hideous behaviour
A gruesome callousness.

Why me? Why them for the matter? Why anything?
Because I simply am, this sad true moment is!
Trapped in the amber of this moment
There is no why!Day of loss, night to celebrate
Greet the shadows for their bliss
No joyful stars to salute
They hide themselves and miss
You...

When you fall to my feet
When you turn your other cheek
I touch the blood on your forehead
I see the fate of the meek
Day of loss, night to celebrate
Greet the shadows for their bliss
No joyful stars to salute
They hide themselves and miss
You...

No wings to fly
Just soil to kiss
No tears to cry
Just horns to meetBy the winds
Of chaos breed
Where man has no future
Only buried past

Translucent skin
Shape shifting features
Belching vocal patterns
Communication sequences (of unknown origin)

Famine upon its wretched lips
Spreading synthetic thoughts
Through it's misshapen orb
Emitting ultra violent intentions
Emitting ultra violent intentions

Unlike anything
Heard or seen
Deathstar oblivion arrives
In the womb of the alien's dream
In the womb of the alien's dreamThe dead in Christ shall arise first...
For the Lord keeps his word and faithful promises!
No more shall the enemy torture our brothers..
Sin will pass away!
And every knee will bow to him!

The dead in Christ shall arise first,
for He is worthy and victory is ours!Let us suppose for a moment that the world is not quite as it seems.

Let us suppose that all society is controlled surreptitiously by covert, rather than overt dictatorship, all modern wars, disease and famines are manufactured to happen and that the true meaning of our life here on earth hidden from us by the "illuminated" elite and their tentacles of media, banking, religion, politics, mis-education and centuries of lies.

Let us suppose that there are fundamentalist, paranoid and merciless governments that would willingly attack their own people under the guise of terrorist attacks (employing the Hegelian Principle - or - thesis.anti-thesis.synthesis). Through mass-media manipulation and censorship these conspirators are then able to convince the rest of the world that we need to follow their utopian vision and establish a "new world order".

Let us then imagine how the realisation of this hypothetical truth would affect us mentally, emotionally and spiritually?(Instrumental)The Great worm rise from the pits of crimson
Hungry mouths descend to feast on the flesh of the sacrificial lamb
Boiling blood drips down from the gnashing jaws of the beast
From atop a bleeding mound of death sits the blood god.

Prechorus
Toppling the great corpse flower
Crippling the Lotus Tower

Chorus
Amid the bloody refuse more lotus towers rise.
from the deep black waters where all sunlight dies
Devour with blind fury, belching blood into the sky
Commanding war-born worship, and ritual suicide.

Prechorus

The altar proclaims crimson trophies, tokens of war.
The revelers paint the world red, in his name
skulls piled high, a monument to war glory.
The bloody handed god, raises his spear to the sky.

Prechorus

Chorus

Prechorus

I am the demon who spits on the lords, of deceit
I am the serpent who feasts on the flesh, of the weak
I am the great lord who sits on the throne, of the damned
I am the great worm who waits to consume, all of man.

Cowards Beg
Cowards Scream
The blood god's ire
is what they glean
Falling to thorns below
Stifling the crimson flow.

The great worm awaits at the base of the tower with hunger in his eyes. Gathering the corpses, the human detritus, the feast will soon begin.




_________________________________________

This track was initially intended to be about ritual suicide, with Aztec imagery in mind I began sculpting images of the sacrifices given to a blood thirsty god of war. But this creation swiftly outgrew my bounds and a doctrine of blood spilling and murder was formed in the dark corners of my mind. The crimson lord of war, the bloody handed god, the great worm, among other titles tolerates no cowards, no beggars. Those whose cowardice displeases him are placed within a lotus tower. A great mountain of calcified corpse's, arising from the blood slicked muck. From this tower they are compelled to fling themselves over for all eternity onto the jagged rocks below. In the guise of a giant serpent or worm, the lord of war periodically gathers and gorges upon the scores of the dead. These periods are marked festivals, where in the tribes honouring him in any of his many names, make war and gather trophies, usually skulls, and spill blood in his honour.(Instrumental)Sitting with empty thoughts on my mind
No help from the silence. nor the candlelight
All that`s to be said is to be done
With these symptoms I`ve sure to have won
With de-harmin-high-zing sounds
that eases the time

Symbolic bells have lost their chimes
But still the twisting clouds in the winds
Voice speaks softly
The back light of night is where I find...So let's go to the church
Celebration beginning soon
Wine and chips don't need
There is celebration by fire
Don't forget to bring
the can of gas and lighter
Afterwards you're going
and you will see

You'll see Virgin Maria
You'll see all saints
Candles will blaze
and people too naturally!

Mass suicidal party mass suicidal of fanatics
This celebrated party survive nobody!
Almost six hundred people
They're burnt in church
How many people dying
till present day for god?
Why? Why die for god?
Why was this mass suicidal of the sheep
God only knows

Manipulation with people
Manipulation with possession
Church needs more
Church will have more
Endless pain of sheep
Endless smile of the saintsArterial communication
Has failed its service
The carrying of the blood
Is at risk of breaking up.
See arteria digitalis
Supply the fingers and the toes
Live in hand and foot
She no longer exists!
The legs don't walk alone,
The fingers don't respond.
Out of hand, out of control,
Body sets apart.
Neurons mutilator
Selling the grey matter
Organs being decimating
Sleep the life view
Dispatch the memory
Rage and sacrifice!(Instrumental)When will one become one with itself
And feed the night with ungodly cries
fiend of blaspheme. and brand myself with guilt
A portrait painted madness that this life has dealt
Twilight skies and heaven's gate ignites
We are here to bleed the fruit of the holy seed

Pollinator of creation
Bred by the spirit of death
Pools of decaying thoughts
Evil flows adrift
A Bruised mind. mangled from a social wrong
Breathing words of refuge into a morbid song
I free my murderous nature into a human kind
Symphonic syphoning
Shrills burn the eternal eye
Euphoric rushes of a conscious flow
Bleeding to extinguish my internal glow
I sanctify through murderous words
My freedom from the human herds

Seek my soul that is brought forth
unto you which has endless love for the carnage
Your distress upon my enemy...enemy
Whom have symbolic thorns?
Wrapped about their throatsAnd the yoke weighed heavily
Upon the neck
And the tractors placed their tracks
Upon the cowering soil

The arrow cast
The bow pulled back
The arrow cast

And the chains were linked to other chains
Forged obliquely, freeing no one and everyone

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

From river to sea
The waves sing and shine
Untrained, unrestrained
Desiring nothing
From hill to vale
Form gives way to form(Instrumental)Don't look now - but there's a stranger in the window
A stranger in the window
Keep quiet & stay calm - the strangers been watchin' all along
Time and time and time again - it gets so close
You can feel it crawlin' under your skin
Stay down, stay outta sight
He just might strike tonight

Don't look now, but there's a stranger in the window
A stranger in the window
Ski mask surrounds his eyes
Hidden in the shadows, beyond the light
Keep still, make no sudden moves
The stranger's got his scopes locked on you
No one knows what the stranger knows
But the stranger's gotta go...
Stranger's got to go.

But I waited, too late, 'til we came face to face
Then it all became so much clearer
There never was a stranger in the window
Just a stranger in the mirror

Stranger in the window

I just might try to strike tonightTake your wife and daughters,
Then you will be banished to the Kingdom of Tshatogua,
So will fall rains of sulfur that will wash Sodom

And two archangels fall from the heaven:
The Ecstasy and the Incest,
In your home the damned old master impaler
Afterwards, he will burn and will sell your skins

Are the archangels made of flesh?
Are the ruins made to the eternity?
Is the statue of salt sweet as honey?
Madelaine in the paradise of my pleasure

It's cold as the death
Transcendental intense ardor
She has the equilibrium of the insanity
In your mansion rise the Armmagedom

In the sacred hill the blessed orgies and psychotropic teas in consumption,
Impure nights,
The old master fuck the wife Madelaine and your daughters,
Mediocre's children

Blind divine archangels,
They're violated
In the sacred mixture of semen and sulphur,
Sacred existence destroyed,
Andromeda in cancer

Toy of the pure eclipse
Humans destroyed, archangels destroyed.I searched for 7 years for the bear that stopped me from going to the Coffin Rape show

The search for the bear

The search for the bear

Hear the majestic war cry of Garyone would argue it was far too close 
for a greater society reversing into calamity 
unbolted its threshold of fear and angst 
confusion heightened at the crossroads of destiny 
somehow nearing the boundaries of turmoil 
karma, justice, divine intervention 
equalizing intermingled imbalances 
from gloom, rise forth the glowing spirit of hope 
we should never dissolve our leap of faith 
keep reeling out to the omnipresent reality 
stretching our mere limits of understanding 
where the end is really just the beginning 
perceive what matters most to earn contented state 
realize its true forms of the animating principle 
the past, the present, the future as well 
god shall reconstruct our microcosmic aspirations 

[july - october 2014]When the dead cease to dream
& nameless stones
become the graves of you and me

flowers of frost
wither to ash
where yawning flames
carve our faces in the clay

cum in me
and set the world free
for a moment in time
together are we.

Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Except the man who killed for god

Look upon the faithless
The forsaken tindered corpse
Here is the joy of murder
And the sweet smell of cremation
This man who killed for god
Who walks where dearth is king
Who gives us blood and flame
And all that terror can bring.(Instrumental)When the master comes.........

suddenly he appears from his mother earth

kissed by the light of a new eve....

Eve of majesty and knowledge we see....

so from the deepest cave his gift comes

How to understand the language of lightning

how to communicate with eldest creatures

beauty of our land is a joy forever

never pass strong as a rock in centuries

 

He unbars the knowledge of haruspicy

removing the veil of ignorance

westward of our origins we found

a new Hall of forefathers for Eternity

 

 

Where Light and Darkness in perpetual decay

Lodge and dislodge burns in eternal flames

A melt material to be atomized forms

Grateful Gods generated from primal chaos

Veltha, Tinia, Nethuns and their breed rules

the fate of mortal kind

 

He leads the twelve peoples in the Fanum,

Sacrarium where gods listen us

Ancient caverns with spirits pursuits us

The souls of the reckless one!!!

reckless one!!!

reckless one!!!

exploding from a ditch he comes

brought us tables of Holy wisdomsI wanna fly... back
to the future, back to the old days
When we were raised with vinyls, tapes and cassettes
I wanna roll... back
Roll back time a little and say goodbye
To all the fucked up crazy shit ov our time
And rest my soul
I wanna Dance dance to the top
Rock the night and never stop
Wanna make it all with you
I wanna dance dance to this sound
Rock this place down to the ground
Wanna live it all with you!
Oh, yeah!
The voice of Michael J. it saved our day
Music was our own way to get away
All the epic stuff we did, from right to wrong
No need for likes or tweets, here we dont belong
And here we go
I wanna dance dance to the top
Rock the night and never stop
Wanna make it all with you
I wanna dance dance to this sound
Rock this place down to the ground
Wanna live it all with you!
The masters of the universe
taught me all there is to know
Jason brought me to the lake
to attend his horror show
There was no Nightmare
without Freddy or without Pennywise
Ghosts were busted
Laura wrapped in plastic, Aliens from the sky
Big hair, loud rock, freedom and parties
We left our hearts in the 80's and 90's
Things moved forward and since then
we have been pulling through
But please let me live one night like we used to!
Dance like we dont care, a kind of magik fills the air
Wanna make it all with you
Oh, Dance we will never stop, we'll be rockin till we drop!
Yeah!
I wanna Dance dance to the top
Rock the night and never stop
Wanna make it all with you
I wanna dance dance to this sound
Rock this place down to the ground
Wanna live it all with you!
Oh Dance dance
Yeah!Worship the son, I'll worship sin 
Strive for heaven and await your death 
I'll strive for transcendence 
I understand the inevitability of death 
But do not fear death, because of it 

God you've forsaken me 
And given peace 

You're shit 
Inconsistent 
Unreliable lies 
Your words are empty 
Your life is shit and you deserve itI'm gonna kill myself!
I wanna lie, dead on the floor.
It's none of your fucking business!
What I live and die for!

I'm gonna hijack a plane
I won't do it for glory or fame.
And when they catch me, they'll see I'm insane.
Twitching mind on the raggity shame.

I'd do it over, again and again.
I'd do it over, again and again.
I'd do it over, again and again.

Blow up the Embassy! (x4)

I'm gonna kill a marine.
I wanna ruin his family.
Point a gun at his head.
One shot, then he's dead!

Pull the trigger, again and again.
I Pull the trigger, again and again.
Pull the trigger, again and again.
Pull the trigger one more time!

Blow up the Embassy! (x4)

I'm gonna kill myself!
I wanna lie, dead on the floor.
It's none of your fucking business!
What I live and die for!A way how I''ve lived
Terrifies me
Fills me with fear
My dreams are
A black abyss
Without the beginning
And the end
A hideous vision
Of the future life
Of my awareness
Awakening brings and alievation
A sudden liberation
A deep reflection
Something tells me
It''s not yet too lateOnce you got it right
Twice you got it wrong, oh so wrong
I'll never deny
That you were meant to die, yes, die alone

We will never meet again
In the dephts of hell

Flash in the mirror
It's what you see
Death in the mirror
The gift I give

You never ever thanked me enough
For all I got for you, no matter what
Well, now it's much too late
To say you're sorry and expect me to excuse you

You can dig your grave
And wear the crown of thorns, the crown of thornsBabylon's burning, you'll burn in the street
You'll burn in your houses, with anxiety

With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning

Babylon's burning, you'll burn in the street
You'll burn in the ghetto, with anxiety

With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
With anxiety, Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
Babylon's burning baby, can't you see?
Babylon is burning with anxiety

You'll burn at your work, you'll burn at your play,
This monster is smouldering, with ignorance and hate

And with anxiety etc

Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
Babylon is burning
Babylon's burning, Babylon's burning
Babylon is burningA maiden died when her home was left behind 
a soldier was reborn and a new kingdom came 
ruled by the laws of God and her own faith 
All the battles she won 

even the church the miracle disgraced 
queen of madness she was called 
walking on clouds of peaceless joy 
heaven's light was feeding her faith 

Dreams of success 
reaching her fate, 
On old unbreakable minds 
with two angels at the sides 
a saint was now at the head 
and with great fear of being damned 
the fools had burned a saint 

captured by the enemy 
the heartless crowds rejoyced 
with no soul, no love to share 
these acts were just the spark 
that lighted on the fire

Now Joan of Arc is history 
but we have her legacy 
she made a "good firm, lasting peace" 
either by love or by force
walking on clouds of peaceless joy
heaven's light was feeding her faith 

Dreams of success 
reaching her fate, 
On old unbreakable minds 
with two angels at the sides
a saint was now at the head
and with great fear of being damned
the fools had burned a saintMy bones have decomposed
You stand on the soil
That will strike you down
You will be absorbed
By your own weaknesses
The misanthropic deities
Cry down at you
From the lightning in the sky
This is your final warning
Someday you will cross the line
Eons have passed
My signal is fading
I have shed my physical form
All I have is this spirit
Blown by the wind
Across the sea
Leaving the solar system
Beyond the galaxies(Instrumental)High, high, high in the sky
Apple, apple, apple pie
Rye, rye, chicken on rye
Oh my, my, my, my!Rub the red crown
Tie the knot of veins

Red crown
White collar
Golden tooth
Hang the chandelier of bones

Rub the red crown
Wear a purple robe of meat

A sparrow flits his feather
Like a chain of bubbles
Soaking in heat
Fucking in an orgy
Of primordial undecidability

From chaos to the brain

I am an army of pulses
My hard skin is a flute
My brawn is a catapult

Rub the red crown
TIe the knot of veins
Rub the red crown
Hang the chandelier of bonesBetween blood and bones, a web of scars.

We cannot separate between night and day.
We are not able to see, so we started to pray,
We call you father, make us complete.
Yet we are blind, you are the eye we need.

Captured in questions and pragmatic analysis.

We cannot separate between right and wrong.
Grant us your morale, oh please, divine one.
We call you father, make us complete.
Yet we are helpless, your guiding hand we need.

In sensuous moments, a mendacious praise.

We cannot separate between life and death.
We are your creation, so give us your breath.
We call you father, make us complete.
Yet we are useless, your reliable lung we need.

An idolatrous temple is the asylum of mankind.

We give you our word and we give you our tongue.
Make us one with your world and light up thy sun.
We give you our soul and we sacrifice you our breed.
We are your wandering blazing priest, oh father, you are all we need.

Forever they shall bark, inside their malodorous vaults,
Like dogs hold in cages, smelling the mendacious.I see Douve stretched out. In the scarlet city of air, where
branches are battling across her face, where roots find their
way into her body- she radiates a joy strident with insects,
a frightful music.

     To the black tread of the earth, Douve, ravaged and exult-
ant, returns to the gnarled lamp of the plateaus.(Instrumental)Life strays away from lamenting leaves
Trees stand as ghosts of what they used to be
Yet 'neath the wintery soil
Their roots bide in rest out of sight, safely
Holy skies bless the Earth with rain
Resurrecting waters stream once again
Face the ancient stones so cold
They greet the Sun deriding times' defeat
Yet concrete temples tower lifelessly
Cast a fleeting shadow at their swaying feet
Come the day that marks their defeat
As woods gently reclaim the forlorn streetsMERG, SNUIT EN WAM

Slowly, day after day I'm waiting
For someone I wanted to be close in my life
But all I have to do

Tomorrow I will leave my home forever

Wait, I haven't change myself for you

Longing for this brand new world for so long

It's all OKLooking at death is looking at life without any veils of illusion; you
are looking at something without any form.
Form is an illusion, like this record, it just pretends to exist within a destructible medium. Neither experiencing it nor being unaware of it or its total annihilation makes it a constant or void; fleeting moments make it dynamically desirable or undesirable for other fleeting moments. In this regard, an illusion of total freedom arises. Like a feeling that since nothing really "exists" one can bend all reality. But no! You still have to master the ways of this inherent "illusion" to make way for this idea of perceptual or spiritual total freedom how is that freedom? And if it is not freedom, and freedom does not exist, why do I long for such freedom? Where does this longing for something that does not exist come from? Even if I somehow reach this alleged ambition, why did I ever have to fight all my life to reach it? And can it actually be reached when such question is ever asked? Isn't this the reason most accomplished so- called people end up depressed and suicidal? This is a game that has promises of possibilities in it, nothing more.Give me the poison to restore my wounds
this filthy water drive me insane
I know, this trance it never ends
all that I want is pure death...
 
Whatever I feel, 
whatever I breath
 
Silence, I am the one who speaks  
Silence, let snowed white dreams
 
I want to be lost - forever
I heal my past
 
I swon the seeds of loss
in the valley of unexpected realm
where flesh and dreams reborn
reaping the harvest of rain...
 
...Is beating till bled my heart
this pain I feel will never be undone
fill my veins with dope and ecstasy
I am of my own creation thing
 
It's like a plague that never goes away,
It's always there hiding in the corner of the mind
And waits...until you're ready to embrace your warm body
 
Like a plague that never goes away
a broken toy in the garden of Eden
painting the disaster of the physical substance
 
I want be to lost - forever      
I heal my past[Typhon Seth]

I invoke thee, the terrible, invisible, almighty,
God of Gods,
who dwellest in the void place of Spirit,
Maker of destruction, Maker of desolation,
O thou who hatest a calm household,
for thou wast cast named he who destroyeth
and is not conquired!

[The Heart Gift With A Serpent]

I invoke thee, the bornless fire who
create the night and the day
who create the darkness and the light
thou art the Perfect Osiris,
whom no man, had see at time
Thou art life-bread-flesh
Thou art love-wine-blood
You make the female and male
You produced the seed and fruit
I'm the Prophet,
reveal your mysteries to me
for I am your True Angel
hear me and make all Spirits
subject unto me
upon the earth... under the earth
on dry land and in the water
of whirling Air and of rushing Fire ...... Hear Me!
Aoth: Abaoth: Basum: Isak: Sabaoth: Iao
I am He! the bornless Spirit
I am He! the truth
I am He! that lightenet and thundereth
I am He! the grace of the world
The heart gift with a serpent is my nameA fallen throne in a fallen palace
Glows sadly like the eyes of an old man
There the remnants of glory
Withered to dust and bones

A majestic figure and stainless eyes
Now eaten by the smallest rats
A pounding heart and flaming blood
Now silent and faded away

Every tear of joy and grief
Every home of belief
Every pride and every shame
Now forgotten and without a name

Stone tablets full of honor and deeds
Bronze trumpets ready for fanfares
But who has skills to read or play
To remember this long and sad tale?

Gather gold and build monuments
See them rise and hear the cheer
In the end you are all the same
The king, the beggar, all the same

Every tear of joy and grief
Every hour of belief
Every pride and every shame
Now forgotten and without a name

For such is the way of this world
Where all glory is stained with old dust
Rising from the feet of fallen enemies
Descending over the tombs of victory

There is no sound or remembrance
No pictures to decorate the forgotten halls
An empire stripped of life
The woods crackle with age

Every tear of joy and grief
Every hour of belief
Every pride and every shame
Now forgotten and without a name

Every small laugh and glee
Every great victory
Every drop of existence
Now gone like everything else

Every tear
Every grief
Every hour
Every pride
Every shame
Every laugh
Every victory
Everything(Instrumental)Some people look towards the sky 
See a dead ending 
Many reach further they say 
Only to fail 

True nature starts to Unveil 
Shown by the pressure 
Come crashing down to the sea 
Or live to tell tales 
Only time shall reveal 

As I move past the sun 
I see fragments of those long gone 
Signs of what could have been 
Ashes of Burnt Wings 

Can you live with yourself never knowing 
Better submerged by the flames 
Then live lost in wonderI love the dead before they're cold
They're bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see nothing
I love the dead before they rise
No farewells, no goodbyes
I never knew your rotting face
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave
I have other uses for you, Darling
We love the dead
We love the dead, YeahI call to the Gods Divine
Beckon from the ancient realms
Fathered by the sacred elders
Abandoned to Ungodly plain

Taught and raised by mortal hand
I've come to learn the ways
Have i spawned from the heavens
Or the gates of Hell

I've journeyed to the end of time
I've journeyed to the end of light

Before me now i see
The gateway to the Gods
Come to me my fathers
And see your bastard son

Cold and Darkness surround me
From within comes a light
A figure emerges
My father surrounded by night

Conceived in darkness
Transflamed by fathers
Son from the sun
Pazuzu's sacred one
The blood of demons
Courses through my veins
A power strong and true
AAAAaaaaaaahhh.......

From within the mystic shroud
Uprises the unholy liege
Traverse the unholy plain
Unforgiven by holy Yahweh
Godless and surreal
Undefine the scared vacinity
Subdue the human race
The light will fall and recede

Lechery i howl
Anoint me
Devilry i howl
Appoint me
Lechery i howl
Confine me
AAAAAaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

Time, has become
What i see
I become Spirit of the sun
Call to thee
Incant me
Race of men
Call to thee

Spirit of the burning disk
Spirit of eternal night
Spirit of the rendering of the veils
Burning in the fire of night

Let darkness fall

Spirit of the burning disk
Spirit of eternal night
Spirit of the rendering of the veils
Burning in the fire of night

Look upon the queen of graves
Armed with the rays of flame
Shammash uncalled Kia hearth
The dark waters stir and decease
In the darkness unseen monsters
Spirit of the fire remember
Shammash, lord of the fiery disk
Race of man, Banna by Uggae

Hear me sacred father
I've done your unholy deed
Destroyed the realm of Kia
Now i claim my divine position
I assail you father, torn to shred
Place your head upon(Instrumental)Decimate those 
Who deceive 
Your soul...
Deduct their 
Wings...
Decapitate them
Alive...
Squeeze their
Lungs...
Remove all
Vital organs,
Bibs, bones
For burning...
Stuff with straw...

Your mind refuse to believe, but you eyes sees the truth
There's no use to scream for help, only you can see them
All to well you recognize them, the victims of your life

Do you really think you can hide from them
The victims are feasting on your morbid soul
Only you can make them disappear
Still your desire for murder grows stronger

Every time you collect another soul, you know that you will meet it again
Every night the number grows, always a new face to see
You're the Soulcollector, a murder without guilt
Your mind is a gallery of death, painted with blood and flesh

The only thing that's missing now, is your own maimed corpse
What can be better than joining them, to slay them all once more
A murder in the spirit world, that's your destiny
So take your life, and start all over againInto the unknown corners of the mind, an array of light twists you round to see, release of euphoric dreams, running through the stream of here and in between. 

Senses unreal, is this reality, that you see? 
Furthering the fascination of what lies deep within, flow through the infinite doors to dwell in distant memories, begins to surround, suffocating on the haze, unfound sensations running down your spine, catch your breath, close your eyes. 
Still are the sands of time. Stars and Sun align. 

Perception gone, the visions swirling in the whirlpool, flashes of light, flashes of absolute darkness, contained to the state of being. 

Be still and clear your head, is that what you see alive or dead... 
Just try and run away, realize there is no escape.... 
Try to call out to your god, found the devil instead 
Find a place to lay your head, sweet words he said.... 

Into the treaded corners of the mind, an array of light forces you to see 
Release of decrepit things, drowning in the stream of here and in between.Without a soul / you can rule the world
You can curse us all / how could you fall?
You're an empty shell / built from brick
A living hell / spewing shitKidnapped when you were just a boy
No experience, youth was just a toy
Goodbye innocence, death embodies your salvation
Kill or be killed, another match - abomnation
Say goodbye - kill or die - fear's out of control

Kill him with your bare hands
Choke him like you don't care
To survive just one more day
Rape her with indifference
Torture 'till the final breath
In their foul snuff-twisted play

Beaten on the floor you're the next live prey
The only things you see are hollow shades of grey
Now it's easier when the opponent's falling
Delirious when you hear the curtain calling
Easier - delirious - no fear's under control

Kill him with your bare hands
Choke him like you don't care
To survive just one more day
Rape her with indifference
Torture 'till the final breath
In their foul snuff-twisted play

Your master showed you how to rate the pain
Your self-control will not fade away
Your indifference and your lust for death
Will you ever free yourself from these chains?
But tonight one more match and you will kill again!

Kill him with your bare hands
Choke him like you don't care
To survive just one more day
Rape her with indifference
Torture 'till the final breath
In their foul snuff-twisted play(Instrumental)After scaling the Wall of Death, Ghoul descends into the sewers of Creepsylvania, sneaking their way towards Svatoplunk Square and the bomb... but shifty eyes espy their descent. 

IV. DUNGEON BASTARDS
 
Exiled... condemned to the sewers
Troglodytes in a realm of manure
Eerie decrees from a mummified head
You will grovel for your daily bread
 
Merciful Kreeg, you are noble and wise
Command us O Lord, as we lower our eyes
You are the chosen, you are the few
And this is what you're gonna do...
 
GO FORTH AND KILL
Secure our domain from the infidels
GO FORTH AND DIE
Take your place in the clubhouse of paradise
GO FORTH AND KILL
Try to remember to make out a will
GO FORTH AND DIE
And don't ask why!
 
Agents of chaos reduced to slaves
Broken wills and degenerate knaves
For a mummified prick, they want to cause our demise
But we're gonna cut 'em down to size
 
Ropes are slipped, esophagus ripped
Spraying blood into quivering lips
Burying hatchets into sunken in chests
As we urinate on denim vests
 
Bastards! Dungeon Bastards
Bastards! Dungeon Bastards
 
Heads roll as the tables turn
They didn't know fear, but now they're gonna learn
Penitence from the slobbering masses
Taking names, then stomping asses
 
Kreeg's head is smashed to bits
A cacophonous wailing from the ignorant twits
You will follow and we will lead
'Cause we're fucking GHOUL, and we will make you bleed(Instrumental)I embrace great victory! 
Ride spread the word 
Take to my people the great news 
We shall return 
To our splendid Capital 
We shall return 
And bask in the glorious greetings 

Bask you shall 
Bask you shall 
Fools 
Senseless fools 

Hark! Across the horizon - I see it 
Our homes - great capital 
Come forth and ride 
March on and return 
Our great victories 
Will make us heroes 
Our great battles shall make us nobles 

What am I? 
That follows 
That which is 
Unseen 

We return 
To our homes 
Oh great city 
We return 

I follow 
Come my lambs 
I call to you 
You shall follow 

You feast your armies 
- I'll take your sons 

Lead me to your precious babes 
I come for them 
And yet you know nothing 
Of all that I am 
And return with that 
Which shall take 
All that it desires 
All that it desires 

Oh! Father 
Can you see it... not? 
It calls me 
Beckons me to follow 
I feel a will overpowering me 
Save me - I must go 
The elders see it not 

Oh! Children follow 
My will captures your souls 
I take you and you shall follow 
Watch as they follow 
See not that which leads 
Those fools they know not of me 
But you my children 
Shall learn all 

To the mountain 
To the mountain 
Come infant disciples 
I shall grow eternally strong 
You hear my song 
It enchants your souls 
You are in my power 
I shall take you awayOnce in a blue moon
I feel it's way too soon
Never trust who's dressed in white

The tables have turned
As far as I'm concerned
There's no actual reason to fight

The twilight's gone
The night is here
The stars are shining
The cut runs deep
The line of fire wasn't meant to be
No it was not
It was never ever meant to be
No, it was not!

Flying on a balloon
All the way to Neptune
No, there is no end in sight

No one has returned
Lies will just get burned
To the people that seems alright

The dawn is gone
The morning's here ( the night is here)
The sun is shining
The wound is deep ( the cut runs deep)
The line of fire wasn't meant to beThey were hiding from certain death 
Red snow mountain, no way to escape 
Eyes pulled out 
Torn apart limbs 
Mysterious death 
Otorten(music by Andrea Piccardi, Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Piccardi)

I can hear my whisper
in this room so cold
I can hear my heartbeat
the night is knocking on the door
Rain upon this place, shadows dance with pain

Empty glasses and cigarettes
Songs to remember, songs to forget
Rain upon this place, rain inside of me

//chorus
'Cause I'm missing you
I cry for you
I feel lost without a reason why
so let me close the door and turn off the light
'Cause I'm missing you 
I cry for for
now you sleep with angels in my mind
'cause you're a star inside my nights

Someday we'll meet again, don't cry for me... here I am
Now that you are gone I sing to you this song
Your flame still burns here every day
'Cause angels are never far away...

//bridge

I want to think that you're still near... that you're still here
'Cause sometimes I need you,
I want to think that you still smile
'Cause in the sky I can see your shine
From where you are, what do you see? Can you hear?
I send to you these words... oh, please now listen to me... it's my gift for you
it's my gift for you

//chorus

An empty dark place
When the lights are gone
I can talk to you again
Now hidden from this world...
I know that you'll be watching over me... forever

//chorus

//chorus

Oh, yeah, I'm missing youI am what you despise
I am a needle in God's eye
No congregation of yours can change who I am
A lecture from one of your priest won't change what I am

I am forbidden to man
I am an abomination to God

I know how it must sting in your eyes
for you to see how I walk over Christ
I laugh at your cross I laugh at the way that you kneel
in front of a man that was nailed to save you from me

Your holy water won't cleanse me from sin
I laugh at your Christ and his crucifixion
Bleeding your cross with each breath that I take
Preacher I know that your stories are fake

I am forbidden to man
I am an abomination to God

I don't care what you say
I don't care what you think
Everything that I do I do it for me
Nothing you can do to stop me

I am forbidden to man
I am an abomination to God

The church means nothing to me
The cross means nothing to me
I refuse to live by your holy laws
Never will I live by your holy laws

Your holy water won't cleanse me from sin
I laugh at your Christ and his crucifixion
Bleeding your cross with each breath that I take
Preacher I know that your stories are fakeI poop out of my weiner!(Instrumental)The excuse for our existence seems so far away 
How longer before we start to comprehend 
The further we walk along the line 
We only seem to be getting further from the end 
Incapable to detain the answers 
Will we ever be able to apprehend 
Bound with limitations 
To see, to get, to admit it 
Could we ever understand? 

Shut your eyes and give up the fight to see 
End this quest for clarity 
We're led astray, sufficed for me, needless to say 
Shut your eyes and give up the right to be 
End this quest for clarity 
We're led astray, sufficed for me needless to say 

Had enough of what it all means 
Shut me off I'm caught in routines 
And after all it's not what it seems 
Had enough of what it all means 

Could you tell me why are we blind to see why 
Instead of answers we are given ignorance? 
I lay in innocence and accept that it doesn't make a Difference 
The distance between us keep us from reaching 
The cause of our existence you might as Well turn me off 
That it I had enough of this lack of Evidence! 

Shut your eyes and give up the fight to see 
End this quest for clarity 
We're led astray, sufficed for me needless to say 

Had enough of what it all means 
Shut me off I'm caught in routines 
And after all it's not what it seems 
Had enough of what it all means 

Do remember this is nothing but a gesture 
In search of truth misled 
Further and further from the proof 

Further from the end, I'm led 
Further from the end, I'm led 
Further from the end, I'm led 
Further from the end! 

Do remember this is nothing but a gesture 
In Search of proof misled 
Further away from the truthLook behind the mask and you will see
That this is not your destiny
In a time when the hope is dead
And happiness only brings pain in the end
You escape into your silent halls
And sits in the corner like a king of agony
Mourning like a widow on your own funeral
Hating your life for every single mistake

Use your weakness to grow stronger
Instead of letting it pull you under
Wanting to be the king of agony
The ruler in this world of misery
Allow yourself to see the good things in life
and not just the painful lies

Trying so hard to keep your eyes shut
To become a servant in this suicide nation
Building your kingdom with your fear
Keeps your mind unaware
Of the world outside your royal illusion
Hiding from the origin of your life
Why can't you realize
That your worst enemy is yourself

Use your weakness to grow stronger
Instead of letting it pull you under
Wanting to be the king of agony
The ruler in this world of misery
Allow yourself to see the good things in life
And not just the painful lies

Sitting alone on your throne
Planning your revenge
On the thing that made this fatal injury
Falling deeper into yourself
You could have been it all
Instead you sit there and suffer
Is it so hard to see
that you weren't meant to be...

The King of AgonyOverloaded with power, the transmission destroys the minds of the hapless townsfolk, sending them headlong into a mindless orgy of consumption... 

Tooth and Claw 

Ravenous bloodlust 
Consumed by a sickening urge 
Hunger gnaws at bloated guts 
Compulsively driven to binge and purge 
Chunks of chewed up tongue are puked 
From salivating jaws 
Autophagous bacchanal of mutilated flesh 
Red in tooth and claw 

Tooth and claw! 

Skin is flayed with razor blades 
Appendages chewed down to stumps 
Gulping down flesh with a gurgulating belch 
Vomited carnage is oozing in clumps 
Bones are smashed with mallets 
Marrow drooling from their maws 
Autophagous bacchanal of mutilated flesh 
Red in tooth and claw 

Tooth and claw! 

Slithering torsos congregrate 
As they're drawn to the transmission source 
Panic in the lair of the Basilisk 
Entrances are reinforced 
Shattering glass in the throne room 
As the multitudes seek to be fed 
The Basilisk flees into the swamp 
His acolytes are ripped to shreds 

The compound slaked in gore 
When Dissector passed the gate 
He smashed the dungeon door 
And Ghoul made our escape 

Solo Digestor 
Solo Dissector 

Tooth and claw!The Pre Apocalyptic Stare

Demons from dark minds 
Infect us so sublime
Ultimate dark tide 
End of humankind

Vacant eyes, violent times 
A common hate to seal our fate 
Desolation annihilation 
Take your time, forget your life

Gazing faces unaware 
The pre-apocalyptic stare 

Forgive us not, leave us to rot
Nuclear future
Feel the flame, taste the pain 
Take a breath, welcome deathABSTRACT

Abstract essence
Of the reality
Controls, the limits
During many years
Believe , the truth
With pain will be arise
Tormented, as death
Will be corrodes your mind

Do they fight
Do they die
Rise up for their rights

There's nothing in the life
Of a man without a dreamWHAT THE FUCK!

It was Friday night, and Gary grabbed his keys to his car.

HOLY SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK!

When he discovered he was out of gas and he had two tickets to the Coffin Rape show.

HOLY SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK!

Distraught, he called his friend for a ride.

WHAT THE FUCK, FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

Gary: Hey goatman

Goatman: Yeah

Gary: I need a ride, to the show tonight

Goatman: I'll be right over

Gary: Alright

A half an hour passed when he realized that Goatman wasn't there

He was eaten, by a bear

He swore that one day he would get his revenge

THE REVENGE OF GARY!After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

Circle of the tyrants!

The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

Circle of the tyrants!

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads...
...of victory and defeat
I hear the tales...
...of frozen mystery

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque... glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque... glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars
Are like everlasting shadows(Instrumental)Disposable morphology 
 Caving in the cage of my body 
 Sarcophagus full of black water 
 The galling sense of intolerable restraint 
 Straying through an infinite nothing 
 Wasted youth chained to this tomb 
 Torn away from that self who could do more 
 Yearning to crawl in among the machinery 
 Rain over black algae 
 Charred cruciblesMachines that rape
Conquering these lands
Hills under the eye of the hawk
Valleys flooded with blood
There is no turning back
We must return to glory
There is no sign of peace
Terror rages forever more

Not only the wind
It's the breath of death

Smell the victory
Celebrate the lifeless flesh

Consume the enemy
The curse of life's circle remains

Do we want our death?
Do we really deserve our freedom?
Level of sacrifices too heavy to bare
Victims of our choices become ghosts
They never leave us alone
...and that ain't no freedom!
Who are our people?
Who's on our side when the wind of steel arrives?
We know the truth
But we still don't have the way to represent it

We need no education
All we need is a voice
The arrival of an antichrist
Refuse the illusion of paradise
We stand for the reality and the pain
No relief no justice
The way of our life is our endYOU WILL SEARCH AND YOU WILL QUESTION
YOU WILL CHERISH AND CURSE ME IN THE PAIN
THE MORE I LET YOU GO THE MORE YOU STAY IN
THIS IS THE VOICE FROM WITHIN

YOU, WIELDING YOUR HEAVY SWORD
I WILL BRING YOU DOWN WITH MY WORD
THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN THE TIME BENDS
COLD, PIERCING LOOK
FREEZING EVERY MOVE
THIS IS THE DAY WHEN OUR WORLD ENDS
BUT WHAT DO WE GAIN BY THROWING THE STONES AT US?

JOY, FAMILIAR SENSATION AND THRILL
UNBREAKABLE URGE TO KILL
MAKING BEND YOU DOWN ON THE KNEES
WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY
BUT CHANCE IS LOST, HEARTS LED ASTRAY
IN VAIN YOU TRY AS HARD AS YOU MAY
BUT HOW CAN WE SEE WITH A FIERY RAGE IN OUR EYES?

TREPHINATION, TIME AND AGAIN
PREMONITION, UUUUGHHH

ALLURING, CONSUMING, WATCHING THE HEAD TO HIT THE SKY
ABUSING, CONFUSING, FALLING DOWN CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY

READY FOR LOSING YOUR MIND
STEADY, ONE OF THE KIND
THIS IS THE SAME AIR THAT WE BREATHE
DON'T TRUST MY ANGEL ANYMORE
FEELING FURY AND HATRED TO THE CORE
AND YOU REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS SANE
HOW CAN WE DANCE WHEN OUR FEET IN THE LAKE OF FIRE

ALTERATION, AGAINST THE GRAIN
CHALLENGING, UUUUGHHH

DISRUPTION, DECEPTION, MISSING ANGEL FOUND ON THE BRINK
INTRUSION, DELUSION, THE HEAVEN IS HIGHER THAN WE THINK(Instrumental)Pipe dreams and amnesia ceilings coordinate my subordination
Movement I recommend
Bullet proof heart, disordered head

The perfect compliment In the cross hairs of Promethean scope
Propaganda is omnipotent
Dote on every whim

Pipe dreams and amnesia ceilings coordinate my subordination
Spoonfed sawdust
Glares nest
Mental screen saver
Without reverse means
Slavery
To
Me(Instrumental)Pay homage
Come and greet your brothers
Blood is on their hands
Tears are on their faces
Dusky song
Rising up
Mothres mouths
Hipnotic lament
Tears of victory
Bitter cry flows by
Heat of stake can't burn today
Bodies of those
Who are dead
Where are they now
They are just there
Where ground is sinking in blood
Where black bird flies above
Dusky song
Anthem of dead souls
First of anger
Is clenching now
Fire of vengeance burns heat
You'll rise up in arms
Dusky song
Every note
Will sound once again
Call of anger
Blood for death
For death blood
Which song
Can you hear
Marching off to fight
Dusky song
To throw sword
To look back
To wipe tears
Today him
Tomorrow you
End of game
Lapse into silence
Song of vengeanceworlds, tearing apart at the seams
true chaos
a wormhole opens...Take me to the light
And show me what's inside
Come play with me
And make me how you like
If there's one thing that you know
It's I will never go
'Cause I love you more
More than I thought I might

So my child, well I will never leave you tonight
Open up your eyes and let them weep
Sinful as I am, please take my hand
And let us lose our cares for life

It's hopeless here I know
But hopeless we will go
Into the days
The days that drop like flies
If there's one thing you should know
The last day we will go
Into the dark with nothing left inside

So my child, well I will never leave you tonight
Open up your eyes and let them weep
Sinful as I am, please take my hand
And let us lose our cares for life

So my child, well I will never leave you tonight
Open up your eyes and let them weep
Sinful as I am, please take my hand
And let us lose our cares for lifeCommunicating with the void
Staring into an illusionary wall
Running without any destination
Trying to put the pieces in place

Fragmentary moments of completeness
Rush before the inner eye
Too fast to find the whole shape
And the only thing that remains is emptiness

Darkness falls over the jigsaw puzzle
And fate awaits the next move
But like a puppet master who forgot the responsibility
The hand never changes the pose

Fragmentary memories of the painting of life
Disturbs the precious sleep
But when the mind awakes
All that's left is a fuzzy shape of the solution

Unspoken words haunt the perfectionist
As misunderstandings suffocates the true meaning
The pieces turns to clay
And the only thing that's in place are the nails in the coffin

Fragments of a forgotten soul
Begins to grow and connect
And the obvious solution is the one who's always there
The puzzle and the painting is left completeSo ageless
this darkness
I can't die
trapped all time

These visions
you hear me
Masquearde
no ending

The waters of christ
cursed me to what I am
The blood of the nazarene
Shall be shed

This bloodline
Centuries past
All clouded 
Nothing lasts

I dream life
I can't know
All future
Goes to slowSomeone told me that I'm lost in time
Someone told me that I'm lost in mind
You make me release my deepest fear
You make me believe the words I hear

Long ago beneath the tide of the moon
The treasure began to burn with lazy fume
And many came to celebrate the pain
In hope their lifes would than never have an end

Endless life means running forever
Endless thoughts seem to turn away
Even time can be pulled together
But no one has got the chance to live forever

I tremble in balance of the years without me
I look at the gravestone but I can't believe
We only have one act at the stage of the world
Gathered in the wild open end

Nobody knows why but all face the facts
The ones who don't have to wait the same time
In spiral circles a fusion of mind and time
Imagine one day you only have to fuel the fire(Instrumental)Insulting our intelligence on a daily basis

Taking for granted that we are not allowed

To kill without consequence

If I only could shut you up for good

By burning  your head while stabbing your chest

With a knife and crushing you legs with a hammer

 

Staring at the corner to take away all your hope

Praying still the moment they slit your begging throat

There's never enough time to bleed remembering all the sins that you know

Your torture never ends, descend

 

Failure, an absolute waste of space

Collapsing, your skull sickeningly ruptures

Aversion, to your fatuous ways

Abhorrence, I must erase you

 

Warped minds find my actions

Sick and depraved

I only act on instinct

The stupid must DIEFace straight down to the endless depths
Cage stained with blood of devil's sons
Defiled all the frown's of psychopaths
Walls collapse, poles apart to the...
 
Faith dead calm for the souls that lost
Eyes closed tight and praying to god
trembling warm breath and disharmony
Walls collapse, poles apart to the...
 
Suicidal cross, so many years ago
stare into the life, a haze for your torment
suicide, suicide..., wrapped in nothing
 
Face straight down to the endless depths
Cage stained with blood of devil's sons
Defiled all the frown's of psychopaths
Walls collapse, poles apart to the...
 
A knowledge for the aeons of slavery
the sound of genocide
 
desperate and alone 
storming down the pillars
a blasphemy from apart
the instinct of killer
the one for the soul and skin
a curse for life
a labyrinth with repeat
a hole in our mind
 
Once Finite - Burning the end of time
Once Finite - Trembling the god's hand
Once Finite - A line of sand and tears
Once Finite - Holiness from the past(Instrumental)She's waiting for the black uncle
Dressed all in white
She has her womb full of blood
An unintentional implement of physical satisfying
Let at disposal of a restricted cerebral capacity
Scars that will never get healed up
Forced simulation of comfort
A vaginal alien having a ride through the body
She might defy one day
And will not feel like
A used implement of physical satisfying
...of a restricted cerebral capacity(Instrumental)Music/Lyrics: Fischer 

Come 
Now's the time 
Hear their lies 
Of power, war, and fame 
You will be forever shamed 

Blind 
You will go 
All alone 
Forgetting all you love 
Blood will stain this snow white dove 

A selfless hero 
A perfect vision 
Hell now will cut 
Its first incision 

This is a one man war 
What are you fighting for 
This is the end of all you know 
And when the dust clears 
Will you have faced your fears 
Or given up all hope 

Gone 
Is your pride 
Give your life 
You've only one to waste 
Why spend it in such a haste 

Take 
Take your shot 
All you've got 
You'll burn eternally 
But this time you'll be set free 

A lifeless hero 
A blurred decision 
Hell now cuts in 
With such precision

Treated like a social disease 
Cast out, he was a slovenly twerp
Heavy Metal was his only release 
Picked on, he got a beating a day
While everybody looked the other way
Headcase, living in a fantasy world
His nerves were starting to fray

Comic books! Vacant looks! Brain sick! Horror flicks!
Schools out, and the bullies await 
Little Billy was gonna get trashed 
Headlock, and a punch in the gut
They tore up his homework and his glasses were smashed 
Graveyard, Billy ran there to hide
And he fell into the tunnels below
Darkness, and then a light from the void
For eons in slumber, the skull, now, aglow

Mutate! To Mutilate! Transform! Gore Boar!

Muscles ripping through his clothes 
A snout where there was once a nose
Wiry matted hair 
Studded denim outerwear

They begged for their lives when they saw him
He made them beg him some more
He cut off their heads and he tore them to shreds
On the Satanic night of the blooThe Ambush

The journey went on, through a black
forest of misfortune.
Woods of murderers and scum.
Far away they heard laughter.
Many eyes followed them.
Narog scented their were being watched.

[Ref.]
"The second trial is awaiting you."
"In the battle I will be on your side.
My sword will kill for you."

The scum attacked from the ambush.
A violent battle began.
The bodies of the scum were torn into pieces by the swords.
The blades were drilled deeply into the scum's bodies.
The silence turned into beastly screams."I feel I am becoming a god"

Now that you have been deified
No fear - to cross the sunless waters
Now that you feel so dignified
No fear - to enter the dark suffocating crypt

Master of the winds and seas
Controlling man's last breath
Will the people bow to thee
Or lead you to your death?

To stay in the mind of the people who's strong
Is the greatest effort of all
To stay in the memories for oh so long
Then master they will you call

At last a failure has brought you down
You're begging on your knees
Your people has retrieved your crown
You loser of winds and seas

Now that you have been crucified
Great fear - to cross the sunless waters
Now that you feel so damn denied
Great fear - to enter the dark suffocating cryptGo bug Melt Banana for the words.(Instrumental)I love you Satan my father my pride
You showed me the right things to do
Reject the poison of god

I open myself for you

I can feel you inside me
I can feel you inside my veins
You are the energy I need
You make me strong inhuman

Bow your head for Satan
Bow your head for Satan

I am in you
You are in me we are together
You are my paradise my everything
You are my hell when I need it
You are my heaven. I will always love you

FOREVER

Bow your heads for Satan
Bow your heads for Satan

You are my paradise
I need you in my life
I am trapped inside your flames
Love that never dies

Bow your heads. Bow your head
For Satan
Bow your heads. Bow your head

My soul belongs to you
Forever there with you
My body belongs to you
And you will feast upon it too

Bow your heads. Bow your head
For Satan
Bow your heads. Bow your head

Together hand in hand
We destroy the ones we hate
Our enemies will fall
Dead bodies we will rapeVisions of another place
I've washed my sins away
A new day has come

March into the abyss
In my quest for harmony

I search so long for the silence
For some peace of mind
Night and day
I seek a chance for redemption
My path for heaven lies ahead

Lines in the sand
Are guiding me into the land of tomorrow
Lines in the sand
Voices from the other side
Are calling me

So let the wind just carry me away
And guide me to my destination

I'll spread my wings and fly
Higher than the mountains, than the sky
Far beyond imagination

Lines in the sand
Guiding me in to the land of tomorrow
Lines in the sand
Echoes from the other side
Would you follow me(Drifting I come to a gateway. It opens. Singing voices overwhelm me. A choir 
of vocal beauty. But yet beyond this divine eternity something sinister lurks.
It's not as it was
Wait! Great eyes stare down on these beings and onto me!
Two large eyes eternally watching! Staring! Obliviously they persist. 
Something dominates the chorus of voices. A language of alien tongue. 
They hear it not!
But yet it hears them from afar. Then I fall. Fall into the seas of Mother 
Earth. I clamour for the surface in a sea of mannequins. The shores ablaze. And 
in the heavens this watcher fixes upon me. As I fell my senses awaken...dragging 
me into the depths...)Sailing Alone 
On a forgotten path to the sun
All this people
Fall from their ways and die on their own
Years of searches
Didn't find out anything strange
Planes and huge ships
Just disappeared in the nowhere

Tunnel of death that brings to the deepest
Side of hell

The Devil's triangle

Powerful storms
Just can't explain all these cases
So many souls
Were lost in this place to ignore it

This endless quest will be the final test

The Devil's triangleOnce Upon A Time As Black Metal Ruled.
The Blood Was Hot. The Hearts Were Strong.
The Future Seems To Be Ours.

But Nothing More Remained. Because Black Metal Died.
Gone The Days Of Pure Underground. Of Spirit, Pain And Fire.

So Listen To Your heart, What Black Metal Means To You.
You're Weak Destroy Yourself. You're From Old Days Remember His Corpse.

So I Summon The Old Warriors. That We Shall Begin.
To Kill The False And Hate One To Satisfy Our Hate.

roses as I lie naked in the

body underwater and we may float to another 
dawning world to drink another 

love me for a moment (baby I'm tired) 
can't you fucking hear my words protruding 
through the depressed dirt where I linger 
with the footprints of a gypsy universe 
examining my corpse for gold and trinkets

exhausted waste in a bottle of brandy 
that god is drinking as we're left naked, swimming...Music and Lyrics: Gustavo Sierra H

I'm in the jungle, 
Alone in the night, 
ready to kill...
No asking if (what I'll do) it's right... 
(I'm ready to KILL and I won't ask if it's right) 
My job is "to kill", 
My job is "to serve"

-YOU ALL !!!-there was time that we were wary of our life
all those days we spent taking instead of giving
watched my world collapsing in front of my eyes
i'd exchange its debris for a small new beginning
in the coldest freezing breeze of winternight
i see stars on my path all the way back home
in my dream i could embrace my whole world
and the future that is here within a reach

THAT STOOD AGAINST THE WHITE PLAGUE
THAT TOOK US ALL
WINTER'S HEARTDoes the patriotic flame burn as bright
When you see the napalm rain
Do you support your government until death
When it's only interfering to maintain capitalism

Do you really know what you are fighting for
When the blood of the enemy
Slowly transforms into your own flesh
As the legions of fury invades your head

Are you proud of the flag on your uniform
When you see another village in flames
Can you look the little girl in her eyes
After she'd been raped by your platoon

Suddenly you see through the eyes of the enemy
What this war have become
And your hatred turns against your own
As the legions of fury invades your head

Killing every thought of humanity
To feel no guilt while pulling the trigger
Is this really what you came for
Everyday slaughter, every night madness

The legions of fury guides you again
And you know that you are war made flesh
All the lost souls are gathered now
As you lead the final attack, ARMAGEDDONAwaken! Your body rests, yet you wander
Awaken!
What is it that makes you writhe?
Great councillor
Unleash upon me your fear
You hesitate
Great terror hides behind your eyes
Bestow
Teach to me your learning's
Great one 
Doubt grows heavy upon your brow

Brothers! I've seen...
I've seen the thing of greater terror
Fear, fear the words I am to speak
My dreams
Contaminated by this horror
Relentless, these visions I wish to bequeath
Voices! I hear their voices 
Its calls flood into my soul
Unleashing this greater terror

It seeks...beyond my eyes
Yet I see not the seeker
Its screams brining me to my knees
The terror tears into my soul
I hear the singing. The beacon
Beckons this beast
It listens
It hears their calls

It's time!
My brothers we must realise
Evolve, we must now evolve
It's near, it comes
We need to reach the greater planes
Oh my brothers, it seeks us
This thing that comes ever closer to this earthThe ugly sun reeks, slowly the ordure thaws in the heat
Lepers crawl out of the darkness, they lost their eyes to it
Their elated irises are swallowed by dreary distances
The odours vibrate the hairs of every nostril to ever breathe
They extend their tongues and contort them 
And in desperation trying to find clean strains of water 
or even plucking the last nutrience from the dung
They worship the warm shit with bent tongues...

Black blood whirlwinds flare across the stale horizon: 
I see clouds above their church crenelations, above their house-roofs
I see clouds linger, brooding, over their guileless shoulders
When they put their eyes upward, the clouds reflect upon them:
Aloof, from the safe distance, they look tremendous, awe-inspiring
But any sane mind would rip off the mask and unveil: 
Grey, hollow, withholding nothing but small chemical conflations
Creating an illusive grandeur beyond their actual significance

As above so below: 

The clouds are mirrors in the eyes of Man, as he gazes upward
Human thought and value bound together fragily, just like them
Unsubstantial, scattered thoughts arranged as a larger sheaf
And spread out to all hungry, impoverished children starving!
Here we have meaning! Here we have the deafening clangor of peace!
Of righteousness! Of morality! Of the farthest reaches of this journey!
We've all heard the constant bleating and moaning and weeping
And complaining and brow-beating and all these self-important fools
Freedom! Democracy! Worship it, for it sat down on the empty throne
Now we can be "free" and happy together! As conscious as a family...
We can be charitable, because with freedom comes respect
 With freedom comes love, hope and peace, and perhaps we can start over?
Perhaps we can cure all depthless wounds on this abused body?
...But all the alms fail, and we are left with infection. 
Clap-clap! The curtain falls. 
Wake up.

Freedom! Freedom! The chains fell to the ground they thought...
Sirens! Sirens! They call out independence! Autonomy! So we've heard...
They do not seek freedom, they would not want freedom! They rear away...
Why would cattle, alone, venture into the dark night for fertile riverbeds?
Here they have just enough water...

...The philosophy without a spine...

Easily dispersed, just as mere clouds, by a thick, black smoke
Rising out of the abyss of thought, and thus returning toward its epicentre
This conflagrated sky is underpinned by weak timber
Moth-eaten, black, feebly rooted in moist marshes 
And in these marshlands sabouteurs sow small fires 
Which, of course, with some mild assistance, grows larger
Thus emitting a foul, thick, black smoke that scorches the clouds
And from it, acid rain beckons the earth, much like Wormwood 
It intrudes holes, damages crops, sickens the cattle,
It devours the pastures, it embitters the sweetest wines
It poisons the wells and makes love with all this misery
It will crush the mountains of thought as if they were piles of litter
And from the ashes of these bonfires, new forests emerge
And breaches gates to a new world, without murder, without pain
Without degradation and the abuse of the shepherd's crook
In there, what alone exists is the bitter victory of genocide;
the slaughtered pig of false hopes and self-deceit!

Those who seek the world shall find a corpse
And those who find a corpse shall be too good for this world.(Instrumental)I want to put a piece of myself into you
I want you to feel what I feel
In this moment, joined as one we are
Ancient communion, as old as mankind

From the sixth tower
The 24th verse.
36 Chapters...
Condensed to One.

Can you feel me deep inside you?
See obscene vistas of my dark desires?
There has come a sign, joining the salts within
Move the body, summon the flesh

The 7th and the 2nd
Homage to glamour, homage to lust
May the 13th vex deniers of pleasure
And empower the talisman of the free

Take it on the chin
I pass my power on to you
Accept this gift with willing fervour
Let it drip across your contours

Dreams and desires as I hold myself
A rite of passage for each man
To know oneself is to look upon the face of god
The feeling makes it soThe wonder of new life
First scream of the new born child
He doesn't know what the people are
his jolly face
and guileless eyes
which look to dirty mug of man

Violation of the child 
Violation of the child 
Violation of the child 
Violation of the child

Little defenceless tiny tots
that must to suffer on account 
of imbecility of bastard without brains 
who execute these vile perverts

Disgust in mind till to the end of life 
Horrific acts before eyes every night 
Does some punishment for this beast?

Tooth for tooth 
eye for eye
for violation of the child alone death 
capital punishmentDarkly vault, cold and seep,
Nobody can hear your scream,
Bonded at decomposing corpse,
Stay with him for eternity!

Your sores began to open,
Slow succion sound,
Yell your distress,You're shorty
Going to faint
(x2)

Before dying!
(x2)

Little Necropolis fauna,
Is going to appear and work,
Your body now become
A swarming vermine

Little Necropolis fauna,
Is going to appear and work,
Maggots don't waiting your death
Before to scoff you

Intestinal Maggots Enema,
(x4)

Your sores began to open,
Slow succion sound,
Yell your distress,You're shorty
Going to faint
(x2)

Before dying!
(x2)

Intestinal Maggots Enema,
(x4)

Creeping loathsome glow-worms,
Transpix still healthy flesh!
Multitude penetrate in your mouth,
Suddenly, nausea, vomit

Two bodies bonded by chains,
Are shaping a disgusting heap,
Devoured flesh, substantial feast,
Repulsive creatures get out by all orifices.Bleed it...
Bleed it dry

Apply salt on open wounds
Never apologize
The cup is half empty
So am I
And like water from the rock
I have come to bleed you dry

Bleed it...
Bleed it dry

Forget the facts
I've got the patience of a razorback
That's been entwined in veins

Pushed deeper are the thorns
Lodged in your side
Scorched by the year of the drought
Just like a hook thru the mouth
I refuse to choose sides
Like water from the rock
I've come to bleed you dry

Bleed it, bleed it dryDarling, we had it all
The cold wind of the fall
Lie there in the leaves
They warm you in the breeze

Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways
Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways

You said, you said it hurts
The warm touch of feeling it first
Darling, we had it all
The kindness of the fall

Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways
Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways

Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways
You swore you'd leave (look at our ways)
But it's only fair (look at how we suffer)
So darling please, (look at our ways)
Look at the ways (look at our ways)
We suffer alone (look at how we suffer)
The wisdom of crowds (look at our ways)(Instrumental)Crucifuck...Jesus Christ
Died for you, not for me
Is this your savior saving you?
God's not there to answer you, as you kneel and beg to him

I live my life undevout
Jesus Christ I am without
Burning in Hell for my own sins
Living in insanity for what that preacher done to you

Inverted cross sodomy,
Bleeding in the confession booth
Burning in Hell for my own sinsI come from the deep forest
I am one with the trees and paths
The night comes fast and far
And my brothers are free as the eagle flies
The camp fire crackles and shines so bright
We raise our wooden pints and drink
Singing long throughout the dark night
Until the forest ceiling cracks
And down come the sobering light

I wander with the old ones by day
Hearing tales of men and gods
Of gods and women and men
Walking with the wolves as we sing
Of times when the wind whispered your name

It is the time of feasting
And the bow pulls taught and snaps
The arrow flies far and finds its home
Gather the mushrooms and berries
Tonight we feast on the offerings of Tellevero

Goddess of the forest we raise our tankards high
We eat this meat in thanks of you
We drink this because it tastes so good
The sun is high and we've no worries of sin
This ale tastes so good and out stomachs are full
The night comes fast and the night goes far
Flames dance high and flames dance bright
We raise our tankards and raise them high
Our legs love to dance and arms reach the sky

Come my child and dance with my
Ill tell you tales of the mother you never knew
With hair like fire and a smile so bright
As you entered this world
Ajatar stole her away into the night

I grew up with the bears and wolves
I call these woods home, no desire to go
My belly is full and my heart is too
I live life a child of the forest
Proud and mighty a son of TellervoMillions of dead red skins 
Hundreds destructions of culture 
Primary inhabitants are killed 
Their ruin has named gold 
The precious metal 
bearing trace of blood 
Not for god but for caesar 
and for kings dying people

People kill today for gold too 
Their lust for power is infinite 
Grasping is human character 
Where are some limits? 
Where is some conscience?
If you have gold 
you have all
even if going over corpses

Gold for his majesty 
Death for the others 
Gold for yourself 
Death for the othersDisagreements foretell the future, blazing embers dive from the sky, and a putrid decaying stench ferments the air. Shadows fill the cracks of my brain and fury pours out of my soul with intent. Enshrouded in flesh-dripping
armor, I race into a sea of blood. INTO A SEA OF BLOOD! Flaming beams of light attack the ground destroying everything in its path. Darkness fills the eyes of
vicious men. Power seeking mortals with apocalyptic dreams. Our own kind destroying every reason to exist. To Exist. Nothing can take away my pride as a human being. And I, will brutally dismantle anyone who stands in
my way. Darkness fills the eyes of vicious men. Power seeking mortals with apocalyptic dreams. Our own kind, our rulers, our government. Divided we'll fail.
My opinions may contradict all that you would die for, but when all is being crushed, and humanity is threatened we must fight together as brothers. BROTHERS! UH!(Instrumental)Skorzeny 

The one eyed sailor has come to your land 
The thrill of the hunt with blood on his hands 
He runs through the streets in sinister form 
From the mouth of the sailor a werewolf is born! 

Chorus: 
When you hear that howling know that evil isn't far away 
You can hear them screaming when Skorzeny ventures out to play 

Refined and distilled from bloodlines of old 
His malice like fire, his heart black and cold 

Bridge: 
Hundreds of years ago when he was still so young 
Chased by a gang of thugs who were armed with knives and guns 
Backed into a corner, he fought bravely, a blade pierced his eye
A transformation occurred and his adversaries died 

For ages he roams, over forests and plains 
He can never go back to his homeland again(Instrumental)Void in my dreams, I'll never lose control
Search for the right war back - lost in the darkness of death
Leaveme behind the wall of innocence, destroy, destroy all my life
Take a seat next to your fate, I can see what you've done

I feel that voice, those visions, were never seen
They are here for the hate, the truth you created by time
I know their sacrifice was never made, and clouds descend to the sea
Was my face and whipe these scars away, my mission is time

I can stop this time forever for you, I can stop this time

I've died and reborn, now you become what I want
I'll save our souls, holding my breath on you
I see what I've cut behind me, just see me here
There's no rain that purifies all the pastm you and I we become one

Light shine through an open window, one time everyday

Time to clear my mind, to feel my heart is burning, this will be my guide, forever

Outro:
And now...you can bring me down
But it's time, to run for a while
Fron now we're not afraid to die
'cause we know it could be our last timeLike a dead recall
I'm crying out your name
With pain and guilt
Ruins of a life

Like a shadow disappear
Within a glimpse of light
Like a star that left alone
In the morning sky

Hiding in rooms of desperation
Cutting myself into pieces
Gazing the sun
But I'm so afraid of the dawn

Watching myself in the mirror
Feeling so scared by my own reflection
Vivid dreams and nightmares
Hunting me

Into the night, stars falling like rain
Into the dark, I cry your name

Lost in this fatal deception
Hunted by parasite dreams
I am the shadow of nothing
But still so afraid(Instrumental)(Instrumental)In those insane, and yet familiar places, where death lies beckoning.
It is the unseen, of metaphysical nature, That pierces through, beneath the veil.


Rise - Eu Daimon


Face to face - with one and the many, the terrible truth of rememberance.
For the horned god, of infinite seed, Read into platonic verses.

Rise - Eu DaimonWe're lying in the dirt, as still as can be
Peaceful, not a care in the world
As we decay and insects feast upon our flesh
there is another world we're all too aware of...

We know this world will come to an end by our hand
and extinction is our destiny
But perhaps it already happened
Maybe we're fucking dead!

Maybe we're already dead and life is but a dream
A sick illusion we share amongst our minds
Perhaps everything we held onto is hollow
No longer faced with this charade
And death is the ultimate release

From one hell to another
We must thrive on our own suffering
SADISTIC DESTRUCTIVE CREATURES
Getting off on pain and misery
This is your one chance for freedom - end it all

Maybe we're already dead and life is but a dream
A sick illusion we share amongst our minds
Perhaps everything we held onto is hollow
No longer faced with this charade
And death is the ultimate release

There is one escape - one true escape from this hideous illusion............A twilight sky hovers above
A fell veil of despair
rain falls upon the spirits that dwell there
They crawl and drag their fingers across the ground
Hopeless and blind, they search for a love that can save the hearts within.
The trees twist and groan
They mourn and drip tears, for this land is a breathing tomb...
Torturous and unrelenting
Such sorrow exists in the absence of light
My body was born in this grave and I shall return there one day
Alive and triumphant in death
For there is no other name under the heavens by which we can be saved
Jesus Christ, the keeper of men's souls...
Father, we seek your hand...Alone in night
Away of world
You feel the dark
Behind your soul

You're so exhausted
And so confused
You have no choice
You can't refuse

The gift
What's something wild for you
To wait is what
You have to do

Until the demons take your body and you'll be a malefactor
You know demons come
The demons take your legs
The demons take your arms
The demons take your eyes
The demons take your heart

Nowhere to run 
No place to hide
The demons are deep
Inside your mind

Inside your vein
Inside your blood
I'll take your being
I'll take your life

You know demons comeSeeping darkness gathering from within my soul
Terror is the shadow of my fear
Publicated in front of the world to see

Assigned to the theme of being under the guillotine
They didn't wait for the opportunity to believe
Solemnly, they wait for retribution

Waging warfare against the tyrants
Sunlight falls from darkness into darkness
Bound for glorification
There will be no reconciliation!

(repeat 2nd paragraph)

The mystic shade is perpetuated, consumed against all
Sworn to the black
Enslaving with terror and haste
By fate ordained
Spiritual apocalyptic heresy
The dawn has come - The plague engulfs me...

Enlightenment will bring us to the promised land
We shall find redemption

Succumbed impending pandemic righteousness
Falling from above, summoning humanity to its death
Eternal winter cast from beyond

There will be no solace! (x3)
In ordaining this apocalypse
Salvation forsaken...
...Never to returnI Woken up from my nightmare, I Saw my grave emptied of its wealth 
Who are the jerks who stole me my jewel? Someone dares to disturb my reign! 
Im the powerful Pharaoh, then be afraid of all my hatred 
I would pursue you up to my second death. 

The thunder lights the sky. While my anger resound, i finally found the 
Scumbag. He's running with my amulet. I absolutely have to get it back. 
Or I would go straight in hell

Stolen from their treasure 
The key to the Kingdom. 
In the hands of a worthless man 
Rise of the mummies 
Stolen from their treasure 

The key to the Kingdom. 
In the hands of this man 
How can i accept this 
Now the pursuit begins 

At the end, at the end of the run 
I caught him and we fought 

At the end, at the end of the fight 
I got back my amulet 

Evisceration, taste my fist, source of vengeance. 

At the end, at the end of the fight 
Broken teeth and blood everywhere(Instrumental)Depleted uranium in chrome and snow 
The cutting edge is bleeding 

Concertina like clipper chips 
Trash your soul till it's no more 

Thrown by arthritis appended with obsolescence 
Just don't fall down the rabbit hole to hell 
Another crack in the cataracts 
So brilliantly dull 
It's just a white outYou think that you're in control 
Master of your fate 
You think that you have a soul 
Time to contemplate 
You think that you can decide 
Everything you do 
You'll find that you cannot hide 
Though you cannot see the truth 

Wake up from your dreaming life 
Dream on in awakened light 
Wake up 

It's the way you see through eyes naive 
It's time to change the way you perceive 
It's the way the world conspires to blind you 
It's time to break the chains that bind you 

Learn to unwind yourself then you can find yourself 
Learn to shed your skin, motivate from within 
Learn to see the lies with true unblinkered eyes 
Learn to change this state; choose to deny your fate 

Rise, wake up 
Leave your dreams 
Rise, shake up 
Live your dreams(Instrumental)Gluttonized foundation 
Well versed in the art of slavery 

Patrons of feudal interest

Ask the Father how to.
How does one accept such truths, such real worlds.
Fall on your knees if there is a meaning.
The Solar Plexus raves.
Now let me convince you.
It's strange. So strange.

Those who've seldom begged, find their sweet salvation.
How does one resist?
Avarice, vice ruled soul.
Lord, hear the moan.
Many headed God of war.
All is laid to rest by the Solar Plexus.
It is strange. So strange.(Instrumental)My eyes in the close.
I am a dead.
My soul can not fly.

And what gives them right?

Airstrip One has been way surpassed
And no one gives a shite

Sloppy
I am getting sloppy
You're getting sloppy
We're getting sloppy

Target of interest? Too bad for you
There is not recovery

From the 24/7 Orwellian
Mass surveilance machinery

It's all for the "greater good"
So we are doing as we're told

The truth of the matter is that everyone
Is being seriously cornholed

Sloppy
I am getting sloppy
You're getting sloppy
We're getting sloppy

Deaf, dumb, blind
We're getting sloppyThe pathless woods
The lonely shore
The roar of the deep sea
The occulted screeching of owls in winter
The roaring of lions
The howling of wolves
The hopelessness at the heart of lust
The light that hangs above the fields
The church not made with hands
Lost portions of eternity
Too great for the eye of man or his moribund gods
All gone in a flash
The fear and dread of you
Look at it
Look it straight in the face
Look at it and without doing anything, suffer inexpressibly
Suddenly life has no meaningThe dull colours of a silent sound,that take so slowly the etherial of a female body with sensual touch. 
Exquisite harmony of a blank face.Beauty that you can only sing.A flower that needs gold to bleed. 
I can see you are my made of pain and the art of seduction is running through your veins.A dirty maiden dressed in elegant cloak. 
The perfect symetry with long legs.The pale skin with red hair.Her beauty referred to visual satisfaction.I cannot carry on, 
Drifting beneath the canopies, 
I pass a rotting song bird, 
A sign as the sun sets for the last time, 
In search of a home for my bones, 
I've torn myself apart, 
Over something I can't fix, 
I reminisce over past days gone by, 
Shedding a teardrop for blood, 
Thriving off my own decay, 

When I'm forgotten, 
You'll be given the comfort you needed, 
A warm place to stay, 
As my days remain grey, 
Though before I'm gone, 
I mark these words in stone, 
Engraved with one thousand razor blades, 
In scathing blood, my body swayed.Track list:

Of human sacrifice and parents' tears.
Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud.
Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire.
To his grim idols. Him the ammonite.
His temple right against the temple of God.
Moloch! Solitude! Filth!
Incomprehensible prison whose mind is pure machinery
And whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen.
Slips into the brazier.  To pass between flame and flame.
Rendering infants immortal through purification.Draining dry the very mind
All we know is what they show
Never seen - the chains that bind
Lies enslave you (down)!

We are slaves to the subliminal
Choice to accept or reject
Heading straight for the source
Below normal awareness

We are slaves, to (the) subliminal!
We are slaves!
We are slaves to (the) subliminal!
We are slaves!

We saw the signs - we heard the call
The glory days will come again
We saw the ravens - caw for war
We stand as one, we die as one
Like black wolves - we'll sweep the lands
And the black sun will shine again

Vile embrace of the one who beholds
Robbed of thoughts and of feelings
Drugged docile by the embeds
They enter below the thresholdDark at the beginning the dwelling-place of Devils but now, illuminated by an extraordinary green. A light shines from my mouth in the course of this Emerald Vision.(Instrumental)Dark night, I'm not scared of you,
Trust in this brightening moon
Pray the Lords of the sea,
Is some hope left for me?
Wondering now, maybe I will return

Silence rules in my soul
My friends I'm missing you
I'm the master of the seven seas,
I fight for my ideals, no one will see me fall
I follow my way, so I keep to sail,
To nowhere I'm flying (Solitary man)

No, I won't stop,
I feel it in my heart.
No destination around...
Waiting for some shore

I follow my way, so I keep to sail,
To nowhere I'm flying (Solitary man)
No, I won't stop,
I feel it in my heart.
No destination around...
Waiting for some shoreAn unforseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
Judgment day the second coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die!

Forgotten children, conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality

Chaos, rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

Bastard sons bagat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity

Chaos, rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath

On and on south of heaven!...

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
A never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity

Chaos, rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

On and on south of heaven!...What the fuck (4x)

A flame burning through the forest
Wandering beyond limits
Clambering out on the precipice
We cannot return
What we have lost we cannot regain
It cannot be made right again
And so we are
Wandering the world of ash
Waiting for the end of the end
Dust is our food
Clay is our meat
Like water hurled from crag
To crag,
down into endless uncertainty,
I now give you everything(Instrumental)You can't poison our minds
You can't tell us what to do
You can't keep our feelings locked inside
If you do we'll come right back at youWith three of the four fiends in chains, the Basilisk prepares the monstrous mezmetronic mind-control machine for its inaugural transmission to the unwitting dupes of Creepsylvania. As the final test before a worldwide broadcast nears, he reflects on small achievements through history... 

Morning of the Mezmetron 

We were there in the palace square 
When the Pharoahs took their thrones 
We whispered lies into Caesar's ear 
And our knives cut to the bone 
We raised a temple for Solomon 
And we made damn sure it fell 
And when that charlatan was crucified 
We wrote his story well 

Gaze at the unblinking eye 
Watch as your consciousness dies 
And welcome the new order's dawn 
Tremble in awe of the Mezmetron 

Emperors and Presidents 
Have fallen to our blades 
Weaving spiders are ensnared 
In the webs that they have made 
Guiding hands, overlords 
Call us what you will 
We are the authors of the prophecy 
And we shall see that it's fulfilled 

chorus 

Solo Digestor 

Sleep, Sleep 

Now the final act begins 
It's the end of all mankind 
No more hatred, no more fear 
No reason for a mind 
Sit and watch the Mezmetron 
And you'll feel yourself go numb 
You begged for this, you prayed for it 
And now your day has come(Instrumental)GRIM REAPER
(Pate, Mandat, Fate)

CLOSER AND CLOSER YOUR DEATH, AWAITING IN A COLD SWEAT, YOU FEEL
ASCENDING THE FIRE, BURN YOUR SOUL
THE REAPER HAS COME, NOW YOU KNOW YOU'VE NOWHERE TO RUN

TIME FOR YOU IS GONE, JUDGMENT IS PASSED, JUSTICE IS DONE
YOU ARE CONVICTED, LIFE IS YOUR CRIME
YOU HAVE FORESAKEN LIVES YOU HAVE TAKEN, NOW YOU MUST DIE

YOU SCREAM FOR YOUR LIFE, FOR YOUR RIGHT TO BE HEARD
NO ONE'S THERE IN THEIR EYES, NO ONE CARES HOW YOU DIE
THE REAPER HAS COME FOR YOU NOW, YOU HAVE LOST, THERE IS NO TIME
JUSTICE CALLS FOR YOUR LIFE, NOW YOU FACE THE REAPER'S FATE

THE REAPER HAS COME FOR YOU'YOU HAVE LOST YOUR LIFE!

(leads - Mandat)

YOU SCREAM FOR YOUR LIFE, FOR YOUR RIGHT TO BE HEARD
NO ONE'S THERE IN THEIR EYES, NO ONE CARES HOW YOU DIE
THE REAPER HAS COME FOR YOU NOW, YOU HAVE LOST, THERE IS NO TIME
JUSTICE CALLS FOR YOUR LIFE, NOW YOU FACE THE REAPER'S FATE

THE REAPER HAS COME FOR YOU... YOU HAVE LOST YOUR LIFE!Destruction is ritual 
You are dying in a living ritual 
The soul dying from fear 

Just die a little 
Appease me... High above the pantheon, beneath the lunar clouds
A majestic mirage strays beyond the spiritual skies,
Hornshadowed images vanishing into the gallery of doubts...
... I see the angels dying and behold their fear-filled eyes

I saw them dying, with tears of pain no human may conceive...
I saw them dying, upon the throne of beast -
Vampiric lord in the shape of a ruthless wolfen grief...
I saw them dying, taken by the winterstorm they may not resist...

Blessed be the rain filled with angelic blood
Blessed be the nocturnal realm where I belong to...
... where I praise carnality and
hail the pleasures of flesh!Manowar, you are no kings of metal. Because I am the master of the wind. I am the golden warrior. And most of all, I don't wear gay clothes.

You have no balls!You feel the hunger for terminal beat
The heart is sinking
I live my days by hearing your dreams
And will to pain

No waiting until the dawn
Your bleeding empty soul

The real lies of friendly mind
Can't touch your face
I came in peace but I leave this
Place with war inside of me

So come and realize
Look through my mind and see

I can feel the fuckin things
That burn inside of me
Cannot feel I'm freezin more

The hate of dream with ultimate scream
To get my pride back
I have a lust for deadly deed
Curious to find me(Instrumental)Here we have the lepers!
A hundred bodies moving as one, sneaking to the side of the road, 
walking crouched in the ditches beside the royal chariots, 
beside the caravans of worthy people, like sick cattle, 
evicted from eyes, condemned to a filthy corner of all minds; 
the featureless face in the moved audience:
They nearly suffocate to death by each minute
Their unfinished yawns colour empty faces in weird tones...

Their virgins mock themselves with own fingers
The Blessing Hand retracts and the palm closes
They cover their genitalia in fetid gall
And proceed to love slum hounds, as they do with men
The beasts conquer their moist vaginas
Bestial semen colour their intruded holes
Torrential spouts of blood-clotted plasma
Their prolapsed wombs moaning like a miliard organs... 

This is the birth-site of depravation, where its mother writhes in labour! This is all source of depravation; where people live by ideals that are not their own, and where they have sunken slowly into quick-sands of passive consent, and worse yet is the most hideous sublevel of this depravation; the cesspool where voices do not ring loud, and the flaming tongues wane in the cold air, where self-deceit and self-love unite in a most absurd, downright tasteless matrimony... 

Their feet stand on murky ground; their feet all sink into the ordure 
their wombs are barren, and they stutter lament
Bent-open mouths have had their teeth smashed out
Bodies are raped of so-called beauty sleep.

They falter through living worlds  and at the sight of it, shed tears and sob
Razor winds blot portals, blood and dirt, and they are terrified
They can not bear the weight of truth because they feel pain when their illusions shatter like glass mirrors, once reflecting their ugly faces but now the shards cut their pink flesh; 
blood spurts out; tears fall; lies smother, all gives way to suffering - 
for these yokes are heavy, and they crush our shoulders to dust, lest one prepare... 

But this is not their life! 
This is a river delta of unfulfilled hopes, crushing despairs, the ruin of failure and desertion; they can not yet see all their embers but they all know it is there somewhere;  a luminous sun in the darkness.

Now! Consumed by the reticence of all deserts, in visions,
The scent of catastrophe ever pervading their nostrils
The vision of impending doom ever befalling their eyes
The taste of embittered gall ever contaminating their tongues
The sound of holocaust hooves ever droning their ears
Their whole lifes became acts of rebellion; their complete existences are like razor blades resting dangerously on the wrists of tomorrow's children... 
Raped Beauty Sleep!!!!!rise up from the shadows and give form to voice in light
fear shall find no strenght in here, ascendancy denied
reek and indulge in the unspoiled charts of ignominy
cravefor what's owned, sapience shall grimly follow
stern lies
accede to the name
incitement
seize verity
sway to the caltiff
the essence resides
culpable negligence
prosperity cleanses all disgrace
languished conscience
no one is chaste
abecedarian
damning with faint praise
remorse proceeds the vultures
yet a penitent man crafts his own ot
the living soul mirrors of the world
no equivalency with those meant to burn
all diluted by the absence of acquiring something to be reckoned as worth to die for
then the time has come to eradicate life for being the greater enemy
fiercely drawn by this grievous cerebration. A path once enlightened transformed to dust
thus eradicate life for being the greater enemy. finish it now
in valor there is hopeIt's not up and not down, neither East nor West.
This feeling is all around me.
From here I see no stars for I am far, far away.
My mind is on another plain,
Just a blade of grass in an ocean of shields,
To tempt the wrists of Gods.

Have I become a thorn in the side of this holy ground I grew in,
Destined to go up in smoke and leave the rest in ruin.
This poor man's tale, of a mind now lost. I can't conceive what his sanity cost
Never to be seen again...

A voyage of contrition, through mad abolition,
I am the seed of angels tears.
Glistening on a bed of emerald green,
Waiting to be sown again & again & again...

A survivor of time, I'll show you the way.
Which many have lost, in the world today..

"While heaven wept, I held a cup to catch the falling tears.
And from this prison released my mind, held under all these years.
So on and on I've sown the seed, like chapters in a book.
And freed my dreams from constraint, to have a second look".

Have I become a thorn in the side of this Holy ground I grew in ?
Desined to go up in smoke and leave the rest in ruin.
This poor man's tale of a mind now lost, I can't concieve what his sanity cost.
Never to be seen again...

A voyage of contrition, through mad abolition,
I am the seed of angels tears.
Glistening on a bed of emerald green,
Waiting to be sown again & again & again...The time has now begun for life to flow straight to me
What did you dream about this afternoon?
A woman in your arms?
The sea at your doorstep?
No you dreamt of me and of the grave
I know because I was there
And I can be there every time you close your eyes
The pain I cause you in the room upstairs
Is nothing to the pain I can cause in your own mind
Remember thatI shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot the deputy

Bugs in my hair

And all I did was to twist your broken hand

Splatter - rancid smells your bloody face

Practice - slow motions till your death
Reaction - metabolisms waste

I'm going to tear out your eyes
Your look will be better and nice
Crashing noise of spinal saw
Warmed up by your frozen gore

Splatter - before your blood face
Is better - rancid smells this ugly place
Shudder - by the last words you've spoken
Crashing - it means your neck is broken

I'm digging a hole it's the grave of your garbage bag
An important disposed there is no escape your cadaver react
And I retrospect what I've done to you
There is no escape no way out your cadaver react

Your bones are rotting in the grave
I'll never be a modern slave
The sound of suffer made by me
In Earth your body disabused

Splatter - before your bloody face
Is better - never see this ugly place
Shudder - by the last words you've spoken
Crashing - it means your neck is brokenthe spectre rose in pain
a shadow brown , obscure and vast
like a statue of lead
bent by its fall from the high Totem

Deus..?(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Night full of ecstasy
I remember I was there
But my palms forgot
The softness of her skin
But my voice changed tone
I remember, I told her
Thousands of unnecessary words
I remember only the one

If I say that you died
Will you forgive me your tears?
As a punishment I am empty inside
I scream and bleed in my sleep

And I do not know where I left you
Because you wanted to find yourself?

Words meaning nothing
Many confessions, intimate ones
I found consolation in a secret
And though there were many words
I saw your other face - You laughed

I am tired of this waiting
I forgot all the nights we spent together
And if I say that you died
Will you forgive me my desire?
I wrote these last few words
Because I remember what I told you

And if I say that you died
Will you forgive me my desire?
And if I say that you died
Will you forgive me your tears?

I will never know the secret
I reconciled my life with the time
And when I am alone I laugh asking
For your favourite colour

And I already remember what I told you
I told you that you died"We're about to begin a journey through the cosmos. We'll encounter galaxies, suns, planets, life and consciousness coming into being, evolving and perishing. Worlds of ice and stars of diamond, atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms; It's a story about us...and what our fate may be..."

The night sky sings;

Solitude reigns, black sun risen again.
Dark night of the soul, no one to share my pain.

Back to Beyond - back to where I belong.
Symmetry of passion and hatred, borne beneath these wings ; the night sky sings.

Higher and higher and higher ; mountains graze my feet.

You cannot save me now, destiny intrudes.
Summers are now gone, contentment eludes.

Falls are not so great when heaven's winds guide your way,
Tomorrow's eternal light, born in the darkness of today's... today.YOU ARE DEATH, WINGS ABLAZE,

Until you see what you wanted to see 

For once! Abuse me
Abuse me! Until you see
See! Now! Now!
Now!Humans fall to decadence
sadly, like last autumn leaves
birds sing their mourning song
quietly, in grief

cities are now so silent
streets empty and dark
houses are abandoned
like an old grave, forgotten

even when i'm alone
i can hear the voices
they are screaming
like a misanthrope

the past is screaming a conviction
for the people who once here lived
because of them the world is ending now

They raise their fists into the sky
Many didn't suffice to bring the death to some of them
They prayed to gods they died with pride
Some of them sufficed to bring the death to all
Their swords drilled into their skull
The blades were hungry and now have to be sharpened
and freed from strange blood
which is precious for the clairvoyance
The barbarians prepare
to leave now
to get closer
to their aimMagabathi-Ya Nanna Kanpa!

The voices of the rites of ancient Sumer
Are deeply summoning in immortal minds
The abyss of knowledge is open and close
It's path to perfection but not to be sought
For therein lies the truth Death,
The ocean of wisdom, the secret of all
Learning of uninteligible things
Took brains of pagans, atheists and priests
Researches into the forbidden and forgotten
Have always existed and do exist
"The Enchirion of Pope Leo The Third"
"The Arbatel of Magic" and "Lemegeton"
Suffumigations and "Sworn Book" of Honorius
The brothers of the left hand path
"The Seven Mysterious Orisons"
Composite rituals of ancient wrath

Mystical science, the regeneration of Enoch,
The fourth book of Agrippa the mag
"The Black Pullet", "The Druid of Menapienne",
"Black Screech Owl", "Heptameron"
Are signs of unknown, forbidden and bad
The keys to the Netherworld locked in past
Ilusions of mankind created the trend
Confusions of all minds elected by names
Day of birth - eternal might
End of life - eternal might
Unconscious fate - eternal might
Turn your mind towards the side

Being's sense - eternal might
Price of death - eternal might
Future and past - eternal might
Live or die in truth or lies

Mainstream consciousness and things ignored
Sinister revelations of Crowley's wisdom
As above so below - "The Emerald Table"
Most ancient of covenants
Necromantic evokations, "Theosophia Pneumatica"
The blackest grimoires, oracles and ghosts
The world of Dementia
Cursed Netherworld

Day of birth - eternal might
End of life - eternal might
Unconscious fate - eternal might
Turn your mind towards the side

Being's sense - eternal might
Price of death - eternal might
Future and past - eternal might
Live or die in truth or liesBecause
Time never lasts
It ran down and out
Frozen we never were
Once endless
Now entropic and relative
Ending with no fanfare
In the beginning
Of the end
We tried to find escape
But time
Never lasts

Our hearts became so cold
But once burned
With cores of fire
Our auras everlasting
If only those moments could last forever

Joined as one
We chose this existence
Now all our works will be lost with time

The attraction fades
We drift apart
You grew so cold
We'll dance no more
Off into the dark
To orbits far from here

When young we played
Between the stars
We never knew
Time was set against us
And when the distant 
Began to fade
We'd stayed too long
Our time was gone

Because time never lastsDid climbed real high
But fell real low
Need to get back
To where I belong
But you stole my time
You took my soul
You thought you could
Just lead me on

Now time has passed
There're no more rules
You'll make for me
I'll take from you
But I don't want
To get down on my knees
You can go to Hell
You can do as you please

You are a lying cunt
You are a pretty doll
You don't believe in R'n'R
Now I'm sick & tired
Of your stupid thoughts
Stick it up your ass
Lousy tenderness

Smooth and lazy body
Waiting for my kisses
Can't you see I'm geting ready
Can't you feel I'm coming baby

Don't cry it's not a misery
Misfortune never comes along
It's memory or my obsessionDo you remember when...
We fell from grace and were cast out of Heaven?
Our paradise denied
God-forsaken for the sin of pride
The chosen few, the tribes of Cain
We built an empire of chaos and pain
A dark labyrinth of corruption and disease
But I'd rather rot in Hell than live on my knees!!!

Do you remember when...
The world fell to ruin at the hands of evil men?
A new regime with a single cause:
To establish pleasure as the only law
Every man and woman a slave,
Arenas wet with the blood they gave
We slaughtered millions just to watch them die
Then we piled all the corpses up until they reached the sky.

NO!!!!!!
We lost our faith,
We fell from grace
And if I ever see your God again I'll spit in his face
Burning in Hell...we were left to die
But now the fire's in our hearts and someday we'll
COME ALIVE!...inside of our prison cells and
CRAWL! CRAWL! CRAWL!...up from the the depths of hell and
RISE! RISE! RISE!...back to power 'til we
FALL! FALL! FALL!...from grace again!!!

We will build a new paradise
East of Eden where the shadows lie
A new order that makes gods of men
Someday we will rule the world again!
WE WILL RULE THE WORLD AGAIN!
WE WILL RULE THE WORLD AGAIN!
We will rule the world again.travel beyond the forlorn stars to my mystic
queen's lair,
my soul is enlightened, my craft it is
strenghtened.
Jewel of my empire, armies cannot fight her.
Our strenght is as one, epress of the night.
I lay my life down for thee.
Blood soaked battle fields, lit by crescent moon.
My blade of moonlit silver, shinning in the
waters above.
You are my queen, you are my life.
Jewel of my empire, come to my side.
The mystic queen is risen. Jewel of my empire
I lay my life down for theIn my mind everything is black
I've always wondered how it feels to kill
My eyes are searching total death
Soon to be unleashed and to feel fulfilled

I have reached a point where dark emotions takes control
My system is mastered by ignorance
The darkest skies are surrounding me
Death is what I hear and death is what I see

I have lost all senses for affection
My anger screams and runs like poison through my veins
My eyes still searching total death
This feeling has been released

I have reached a point where dark emotions takes control
My system is mastered by ignorance
The darkest skies are surrounding me
Death is what I hear and death is what I seeYou think you know what the future holds
You think you have control of your immortal soul
Well you believe what you wanna believe
You can decieve but you can't fool me... NO!!!

Hypochristian - damned to salvation
Lost in a labyrinth of your own creation
You're a self-deciever - weak & useless
Lying your way through a thousand excuses

When you finally die... tell me where will you go?
To the pie in the sky or the fires below?
Will you qualify for the kingdom above with
No joy in your heart? No understanding of love?

Pick & choose believer - the worst of your kind
Never know which way you're going cuz you're
Fucked in the mind... betray your friends then
You cry about the loss... you two-faced motherfucker
Gonna show you who's boss!

Hypochristian - damned to salvation
Lost in a labyrinth of your own creation
You're a liar in waiting... without any answers
Rotting on the inside from a spiritual cancer

Hypochristian - you're a false witness
Infecting the world with Jehovah's sickness
Chosen by "god"... an assembly of liars
If there is a Hell you will burn in its fires

Hypochristian - damned to salvation
Lost in a labyrinth of your own creation
Peddler of poison and moral dysfunction
Preaching your gospel of self-destruction

Hypochristian - pray for salvation!
No escape from your situation
You're a blind believer, a self-deciever
Liar in waiting... damned to salvationAls de nacht valt

Als de goden zwijgen

de Schrik ketent
en verlamt de vluchtenden

De Dodengeleider kijkt toe
Deze reis was de moeite waard
Hij zwijgt als het graf

All at once the world speaks
When blood leaves the bone
Movement becomes vital
When blood leaves the flesh
Breath becomes paramount
When blood leaves the soul
We lie in deliverance
The fear is goneIn these nights of magic
Where great pain is obscured
By the fantasy dragon made real
By the powers of lingering trauma
I looked behind the dawn of day
Beyond the angstridden faces
Into the mind captured behind
Living the lie of the weakened ones
I captured the moment given
I denied the sickening love
Turned to the purity of anger
I saw myself in the abyss
Complete fullness I now own
I return to earth a demonrace
Denied by man through ages
Now I walk the dying soil
Attrocities turned beauty
Machines of torture turned art
Beneath your cities I sleep
At dawn I weepI watch you through the layers
of hunting and sloth
The abyss of sorrow and pity 
we pay ourselves
 
Blackened sunless horizons above lies on the earth
Bloodstorms and other things devastating birth
 
Fall on down to corpses rotting in the soil
faced in their own blood through the giant coil
 
Maggots crawl from wounds soon will turn to flies
spread disease across the land to the lucky who've survived
 
I grasped and clawed from his flesh 
a mass that is called man
a divine face with rotten smell
 
I have you now inside me,
The claws of death 
A fragile observation
in a world of weakness and pain
 
As the winter is close across the lands of lobes
a carnage of mankind is surrounded by the laws
Hiding them from the human eyes, a mechanic feast
a trap of innocence for the flesh of religion, for the blood of faith, 
for the soul of mankind that is driving to hell
 
A legend full with blood 
hidden in the depths of souls
the other half of mankind
a carnivora's lairDrops fall
Tears crawl
Cracked wall
Lost lore

Tears fall
Cracks crawl
Lost wall
Burn!

Burn!

Lost my fall in darkness
Dreaming towards the light
Burning my rememberance
Buried deep inide
This cage is wearing thin
Bursting through the cracks
These walls are giving in
Can no more hold my wake
Flow!

She speaks thru her eyes 
She fools with her lies
With no words to take 
With her eyes she'd dictate

She bleeds from her heart
She kills with her thought
With no words to take
With her lies she'd dictate

Nittilai, Nittilai
Nittilai, Nittilai

She speaks with her soul
When she crawls to the unknown 
With so many boundaries to break
With her lies she'd dictate

Confined to these rusty chairs
As past disappears in time
She realised there's no more
No memories are so devine

Oh my sweet child
Wrap me with your soft hands
All's over with my dead life 
Seen too much seeking despaired lies
She holds me by my flesh 
Bleeds my thoughts with me as I die
Oh my Killed child 
Touch me with your scarred hands
She fear's my past life
They've seen so much with these eyes
She Held me by my flesh
Gripping me as I died

That was sad...So tell me what you see in the mirror everytime
you face yourself, that ever self
playing with the wrong hand

How much of you belongs to an utter lunacy
once that reality twists its course?
sane and gone, mind and heart

The reckless chemistry
this awkward prodigy

So tell me what you feel when you see another "me"
approaching the opposite way
and both crash but untouched

How much of you is a realisation
a parade of ups and downs?
fuck anyhow!
wrongs and rights, on and off
rights and wrongs

Don't pretend you to combine unmating kinds
don't pretend to combine unmating kinds
we're done right through, we're blind unmating kinds

So tell me what you see
and facew yourself
but don't tame your wrong hand everytime

The reckless chemistry, this awkward prodigy
lord now come to me and watch yourself
the reckless chemistryThis town is a smoldering hole 
Christo-fascists  are in control
They put a Disney store in Svatoplunk Square
All the guards at the labor camp shop there 
Christian values, the mark of their sect
Creepsylvanian traditions what they claim to protect
And the message has such lasting appeal
No one cares that the traditions not real

Burning books in the name of the lord 
The people are converted without bullet or sword
Now the villagers have cable tv
Big macs, cadillacs, and pornography 

Culture recycled and commodified
Fact and belief become homogenized
Total absorption, the past is erased 
A fairy tale history is put in its place

Lickspittle newsmen sell reliegion like soap 
Hanging the dimwits from their shiny new rope
The promise of heaven was enough to entice
They turned into zombies for an army of christ  

Total obedience, the plan is complete 
Flag waving, behaving, religious, elite
Comatose, they do naught but consume
And consume and consume and consume and consume!!!!

Shambling from store to store, life of the living dead
Consuming, then consuming some more, life of the living dead
The christo-fascist corps, life of the living dead 
Its such a fucking bore, life of the living deadOne more of your hollow screams
Counting on the fingertips of the soundless
Climb with pretence to a wall
The step covered into a wrong morphine
Walk with a porno lash with a whip
The sweeping fence of solved remorse
Surrounded by space icons

At least several clicks away
Cheap gallons for empty fairness
Mordant milk strives out and boils over
Glance over morbid enemy

Scurring to a visible day
They assuring you vitality
Arrival from an ash to give
At once the doles of prayer

Throw away dust from granite heels
Switch off a power battery
Disclose the vanishing beat of head
Machine dies without surgery

Searching - Frayed Chime - Requiem
Tearing new head off

Taste the blood of sugarmeat
The lashing breath of dead bell's dream
Cold sense lurking dying harder
Mind covered into leprosyAngels of law constantly sent my way, they leave without any hope... The evil resides within burning all be-ness around without corrupting my cosmic vessel.
Agents showing themselves as angels of beauty trying desperately to instill love into me. All I make is turn them evil! As their pathetic lord spits them out of his kingdom they have nowhere to go but hide in my memory. Of Lucifer you're always vindicated! Agents of order can never seep through thine impenetrable Asat! O Satan, purge me from all being through constant cancer chaos. Azazel, Azazel!!Juul had last van Aambeiorix

Excuses & justifications, you've relinquished your own throne
Deep inside your mind, you've built a factory of lies
The epitome of scum, worthless defined
You believe you're the victim, but you're the one to blame
Truth is you're the loser, of your own sick fucking game
Life is what you make it and you've made it your enemy
Demand sympathy for your wounds that you, yourself made bleed
Lines, thick and fucking thin
You, have, fucking crossed them all
You're such a piece of shit
and your voice is equivalent to the god damn stench
I'll gladly place the noose around your fucking neck
and present you with every reason to step off of life's edge
Lies
I can still feel the knife pierced into my back
Look into my eyes, eyes consumed by hate
Your pathetic apologies come far too fucking late
I
Eye for a fucking eye..
Realize where you stand...alone, unforgiven, soul rotten
Descend into my darkness... You are, YOU'RE THE ONE I HATE
YOU'RE THE ONE I HATE
Let us discuss your existence, so we see eye to eye
Abandoned emotional resistance, I look forward to the day you die.
You know this is the end of the time when we used to call you friend.

...Bleeding on my chest

It becomes a mess...

Nasty little bitch thought she'd lie to me by infesting me with her H.I.V.
I went down on her, she was menstruating
Next thing that I know she bled on me
Pulled a pubic hair from between my teeth
Next that I know it was a tampon string

Blood clots gushing out
Chew them up, like I give a shit
Choking on blood
Now I'll make you choke on my cock
Tossing her salad while she's on the rag
Fucking her secretion as she starts bleeding

Bleeding her butt, it's dripping off my nuts
I don't need the darkness to fuck a nasty bitch

Rotting corpses cunts exite me
Fucking victims, beating them dead
Choking on blood as she gives me head
Knock out her teeth to get my dick in
Punching her face is not a disgrace
Making her scream as my dick bleeds, beating her dead by bleeding her cuntIn my rolling chair,
An invisible jail,
I want to escape of my disease,

In my rotting chair,
I dream about
What I have been
Before I was dead...

Quadraplegic skull crushing :
Feed up to living,
Quadraplegic skull crushing :
Make a end to living!

Why nobody couldn't kill me...
I have to broke myself with a final dive,
I am jumping, I am falling, I'm listening to
My bones broken, my flesh rippen,
My skull open...Devil's power is the greatest one
When his and hers holiest shuns the sun
A temptress smitten by the blackest force
A vicar bitten blind in intercourse
The witch hammer 
Struck her down 
Through our Sabbath 
She is unbound 

It is the night of the witch 
It is the night of the witch tonight 
And the vengeance is hers for as long as she stands by him 
It is the night of the witch 
It is the night of the witch tonight 
And the vengeance is hers for as long as she stands by him 

"All witchcraft comes 
From carnal lust 
Which is in women insatiable" 
A moon shone bright above her trial 
As flames ate through her body defiled 
The witch hammer 
Struck her down 
Through our Sabbath 
She is unbound 

It is the night of the witch 
It is the night of the witch tonight 
And the vengeance is hers for as long as she stands by him
It is the night of the witch 
It is the night of the witch tonight 
And the vengeance is hers for as long as she stands by himWe smelled the greasepaint in the air,
They stumbled into town last night, completely unaware,
Clad in shirts of mesh and with mascara on their eyes
We saw a keyboard player and we knew they had to die.

They played a show at Ivan's Inn,
From underneath the stage we heard the caterwauling din,
They sang of forests, elves, and trolls,
The urge to kill them on the spot we barely could control

After the show they all got drunk,
Apparently to celebrate a set that really stunk,
To the graveyard they predictably paid call,
These lords of chaos whined about their tour bus being small

They spoke of Norway and "the scene"
The sound of laughing Ghouls reverberated through the trees
"We should take some pictures!" the one in chain mail said,
"That's it." Cremator growled, "It's time these idiots were dead."

They scattered like rats when they saw Ghoul attack,
The drummer was the first to go, a hook in his back
Machetes were sinking into painted flesh
Carnage and gore soaking leather and mesh
The keyboardist begged but Fermentor just laughed
We hacked off his hands and then chopped him in half
The vocalist was strangled with his very guts
His female back-up expired from her cuts

Splattering brain pans as a matter of course
Violently murdering with no fucking remorse

Their bassist, to a boobytrap, paid a toll
His head having gained five or six extra holes
The blood from his mouth made a hot, steamy treat
We savoured the moment, then sawed off his feet
Both of the guitarists made a run for the gate
Digestor cut them off and sealed their fate
One of them cried while the other was killed,
His tears did no good as his skull was still drilled

Slicing and dicing, our fanatic obsession
Of slaughtering poseurs, we've made a profession
In our forbidden...
Forbidden crypts!!!(Instrumental)Rip the sacred flesh
Sodomize the holy asshole
Drink the red blood of the mother of earth
Masturbation on the dead body of christ
The king of Jews is dead
and so are the lies
Vomit on the host of Heaven
Masturbate on the throne of God
Break the seals of angels
Drink the sweet blood of Christ
Taste the flesh of the priest
Sodomize holy nuns
The king of Jews is a liar
The Heavens will burn
Dethrone the son of God
God is dead
Holyness is gone
Purity is gone
Prayers are burned
Covered in black shit
Rape the holy ghost
Unclean birth of Jesus Christ
Heaven will fall
Fuck the church
Fuck Christ
Fuck the Virgin
Fuck the gods of Heaven
Fuck the name of Jesus(Instrumental)The Gods of the stars are seven
Their have their seven gates
They are approached by seven seals
And seven material essences

The Zonei

The seven deadly sins
The curse of seven oaths
The fear and seven names
The pride of seven Gods

For time is short and mankind doesn't know
Nor understand the evil that awaits
From every side, from every open gate,
From every broken barrier by mindless acolyte

I learned of the frightful beings who dwell
Beyond the astral spirits who keep the entrance
To the temple of the lost of the ancient of days
The ancient of the Ancient Ones, whose names I cannot
say now

I have heard the winds of doom
And I have felt the breath of unreal horror
I have retained in memory
Impossibilities in their reality
I have seen the glimmer of utmost truth
In that wilderness of madness
I came to understand many things
Of which before I had no knowledge
But after thousand moons of journey
My fate is no longer writ in the stars
And now I predict fear for your flesh
But fear for your spirit more

I've spoken with all manners of spirits
Whose shadows are deep in beyond
I've talked to some kinds of deamons
Whose names are no longer known
I've walked the unknown lands
That no map has ever charted
I've seen the stone monuments
Of vanquished civilizations

The habitation of men are seen and surveyed
By that ancient race of Gods from a time before time
And I know they seek revenge for that forgotten fight
Somewhere in time and space, beyond the streams of
light
Oh, in the days before the creation of man
When the Elder Gods walked their celestial spheres
There was a time when the gate to the outside
Was open too long and the horror was one

The sight of the Ancient Ones
Is a blasphemy to the mind
Painful to senses of the man
And it's a part of the cosmic dance
For they come from another world
That is not straight but crooked
Be sure they will be back
I know they will come soonOn the borders of the maps
Behind the degrees of latitude
Between mars and jupiter
I draw shimmering outlines

There where they sing
Those graceful songs
There where the stars are black
Where the sun devours its children
There where they sing
Those graceful songs
There where the stars are black

In the middle of sketches
In the failure of this mankind
I'm trapped in this fear
I see the human being

In the cauldrons of clay
Beneath the surface of bronze
Mixed with the molten core
There pounds the purest heart

On the dry lips of the dead
Here and somewhere else
In the snow of the universe
You see and hear my hearse

They sing, those songs
Stars are black, devour your children(Instrumental)Grey and deformed image   
reflected in the silver,  
engraved by time, corroded by an unvoiced wind. 
   
Like a ship at the mercy of the waves, 
you advance motionless.  
   
... no mortals will come to learn of what   
only gods are allowed to know by nature,  
but the sublime recapitulation of pain  
distorts the mind raising it to the Celestial Science...  
   
Dragged by a memory towards nothing,  
like Icarus you offer your body to destiny  
that is never replete of human torments 
    
The soul is in Eros' hands,  
and he plays with it like an infant;  
no one raise the fire shining beneath the ash,   
no one wake the beast sleeping silent.
    
A disharmonious adoration, to you,  
under a futuristic mantle of stars.  
Love is an idealistic suicide ?Is it my mind within your life?
as I tear open your throst
Or is it my life within your mind?
as I suck on your open wound...
I lay within your viscera
cold and wet against my flesh
together we dream of darkness
and of death, my only love...Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!
Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!

At the dawn of time when the world began
The serpent gave his gift to man
And down through time we have passed this on
As the secrets are told from father to son

Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!

The Sons of the Serpent still sing their songs
Of the Garden of Eden where they once belonged

Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!

These keepers of the faith all wise and learned
They weild their power as Sons of the Serpent

In the night the ancient rites are done
And the force is set in motion
Serpents bite - might is right
Our venom is our strongest potion

Satan's horde with shield and sword
Cult of the Snake weild high their knives
In the dungeons deep we all keep the spirit
Of the sacred serpent alive...

In the garden of good and evil where the world began
The serpent shared his secret and gave a gift to man
Into the ears of Adam's wife he whispered and he hissed
She turned toward the future and met the serpent's kiss
Seduced by dark obsessions and tempted by his tongue
She ate the fruit of knowledge and so the deed was done
This is the source of all we know... for what it's worth
We owe our lot to Master Satan... Lord of this Earth

And the Sons of the Serpent pull the strings
And control the fate of worldly things

Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!

And if you listen closely you will hear
The sound of the kingdom of heaven
Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling,
falling, falling, falling, falling down

In rebel days our soldiers wave
the serpent flag: "Don't Tread On Me"
Fathers first - sworn at birth
To be true Sons of LIberty

Serpentine conspiracy
All will feel but none can see
Cobra, asp and rattlesnake
Vipers all - Hail Victory!

The Sons of the Serpent still sing their songs
Of the Garden of Eden where they once belonged

Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!

And the Sons of the Serpent still play their pipes
And break the silence of the lonely nights

Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!

From the darkened ages of iron and stone
To the black millenium yet unknown
Heretics once called Satan's Servants
Exist today as Sons of the Serpent!

Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!
Sons of the serpent! Sons of the serpent!(Instrumental)I declare, that we're all just shit
And I believe, we'll die like it
I could try, to still (strong) remain
And realize, Anything is Mine, Anything is mine(Instrumental)Mayflower,...
My source of power
I'm dressed up, you are my goddess,
With harmony in it's consciousness
My source of power,
Like a in full blossom, mayflower
Mayflower,...
My source of power...
More than a servant
Presence, predicant
A muse to my creation
A star of my constellation
Mayflower,
My source of powerIn every past and future eve
In every historic moment
There's been a passage
Through good and evil
As there's was light, so there was darkness

The earth book never stopped
To write down pages
A book in blood, hypocrisy and terror
An everlasting crusade to oblivion
As a scream of the world
There's no way to release freedom

Freedom was light like stars in the infinity
Hope, light and life

Eyes are reflecting the times that we live
And we stare to our dreams blown away
All the technology against the humanity
World screams
Screams from the skies up above
Through the center of the earth

Now in this future of warriors
Where everyone looks
For the keys of destiny
We are all caged in golden prisons

But we threw out the key
There's no way to release freedom

Freedom was light like stars in the infinity
Hope, light and life

Eyes are reflecting the times that we live
And we stare to our dreams blown away
All the technology against the humanity
World screams
Screams from the rocks of the sea
World screams
Screams from the skies up above
World screams
Screams from the depth of the earth
World screams
Screams while we sail to the space
Until we touch the stars

World screams
Screams from the rocks of the sea
World screams
Screams from the skies up above
World screams
Screams from the depth of the earth
World screams
Screams while we sail to the space
Until we touch the stars

Please hear the scream of the world!Temptation burning in me 
To the point of madness, 
I can't even see 
My fuckin' mind is fed up 
To which I want to die 
My anger is intensified, 
I don't even know why 

I might just slice up my skin 
Razor blade from head to toe 
Lie in my bed 
The blood gushes and flows 
But then the splatter 
Of my brains against the wall 
Is such a work of art 
When I slump and fall 

Kill me 
Or I'll kill myself 
Why don't you kill me 
Or I'll kill myself 

When I'm dead and gone 
You eat my shit 
And go to fucking hell 
Moronic worthless twit 
Why don't you stiff me now 
Drive a stake up my ass 
Beat and club me down 
Shred my body with glassI feel your presence amongst us
You cannot hide in the darkness
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?

I know your soul is not tainted
Even though you've been told so
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
A candle casting a faith to glow
You and I see eye to eye

Can you hear the thunder?
How can you hear the thunder that's breaking?
Now there is nothing between us
From now our rood is eternal

Can't you see that you're lost?
Can't you see that you're lost without me?
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you

Can't you see that you're lost without me?

The ambiance is compelling
I sat for iced tea at Pirelli Deli
Though my bloody guaze was still smelling
In addition to our suicide pact
We respect tires, and their rubber track
If you filled one up with sniffin' glue
Our hearts would stop, that's true
At Pirelli Deli
That's just what they do.Take the world - just pay the price
For all the things that we need to be someone
Strange we call it a paradise
We obey like soldiers in user-military
I believe in what I feel
It tastes like sugar but it`s poison
That is dazing our minds

So you think you are alone
And you need something that pretends
You are someone
Your gold is only painted glass
Your fortune is just another illusion
The secret is to have no choice
It`s no wonder that your senses go blind

The feelings unite - the senses go blind , so blind
Someday you`ll find it`s just waste
What they offered with a shine

Used but so amused , like a toy in their hands
You believe in what they say , "why should they lie?"
With naked fears if the feeling disappears
"I just want to satisfy my needs"
With hungry eyes and lack of restraint
Hopeless to refuse it`s much too late

The feelings unite - the senses go blind , so blind
Someday you`ll find it`s just plastic
But they made it shine

Used and so abused and as guilty as a child
No one should control the way we feel
You are buried in gold that`s gonna melt in your hands
"I don`t want my senses go blind , no they won`t ..."Your pain has no credential here
It's just a shadow of my wound
Our world...

If you wish to conquer pain
You must learn to serve it well
Serve it well

Your pain has no credential here
It's just a shadow of the wound
My world...Clouds across the sky
wind and rain
are all that remains
of those days long gone,
where the light of hope shone
why are they gone?

Pale is now the light
that reach me through the window,
gloomy are my dreams
like shadows on the walls.

A reality that I
can not change,
a reality that I
have learned to accept,
all I want is to go away..
Away..(Instrumental)THE WOODSMAN

DIG IN EARTH
THE FINAL PHASE

BITTER HAND OF ELEGANCE
HOLD FAST THE EMERALD BLADE
IN ALLEGIANCE WITH THE SHADOWS
ANCIENT WOODSMAN STALKS HIS PREY
FEAR UNWRAPS CONFUSION JUST A FLASH BEFORE THE EYES
ONLY SCREAMS OF THOSE FORGOTTEN SHALL REMAIN TO VALUE TIME

HELLISH GLOW OF RED LIGHT
ROOM TO INTERVENE
OPEN CHASE IN ORANGE FIELDS

LURE THE WALKERS TO ENGAGE THEM
SWIFT OF BLADE THAT LEAVES NO WITNESS
NOW DISPLAY THE ART OF VENGEANCE

YOU'LL RUN TO THE EDGE AS YOU BLEED
YOU'VE CHOSEN TO WRITE YOUR OWN ENDING

ESCAPE THE FATE OF THE WOODSMAN
BROKEN OF SOUL AND OF MIND IN HIS ISOLATION
THE PRETENCE OF INNOCENCE IS JUST AN ILLUSION
THAT SEPARATES MEN FROM THE WOMB IN THIS LIFE

AWAY FROM PRYING EYES

Those who once into the darkness gazed.
Their blood is stirred inside the chalice,
Yet everything is placed.

They call and cut the air, inside the spheres it echoes wide.
What comes hereby? Out of the living darkness, from the other side.

Womb and chalice, spirit and dagger,
Kneeling now to knock the ground.
Skull and coal, fire and mirror,
Waiting to hear their mutinous sound.

The mysteries are deep, achieving those who can be called.
Impulses flowing constantly, yet everything is installed.

And through the smoke of Olibanum,
The mirror screams and glows.

Eyes are gazing out of the beyond,
In madness blazing, burning and burning the mind.
A chorale sways you in trance,
The structures are breaking, falling and falling to the ground.

Time and life are erased,
In the abyss of growling throats.

And through the smoke of Olibanum,
Laughs and screams the face of death.

Womb and chalice, spirit and dagger,
Benumb and breathing thin.
Skull and coal, fire and mirror,
Visions carving orders in.I see a world 
Structured from my soul 
Palaces from my dreams 
My spirit can embrace 
You attack my body 
Making me ever strong 
I shall stand tall 
I am everlasting 

Souls rise to the eternal sea 
The weak crumble away 
Strong becoming ever stronger 
A force beyond the mortal 
Hear the souls call 
Lifting me from within 
Embraced I rise 
A god in my death 

Reaching the invisible mass 
It engulfs me with sanctity 
I am caught with the others 
The ones who dream in splendour 
My beacon burns so bright 
Becoming brighter still 
My call cries over all 
I have risen beyond the physical 

Solo: Macey 

I rise 
I soar 
I am everlasting 

Solo: Macey 

Call out to me 
As I soar above 
Beyond the power of sight 
I exist in a world of dreams 
Physical state gone from my memory 
I rise forever more 
Immortality beckons 
I exist eternally 

Solo: CromptonWhen squashing my skull against the two metal pieces 

 From the matter like extreme increase of which we are 

 In front of me, unshaken and scared 

 Following the guidance of faith procreated during those days 

 Persecuting the theory of the truth as far as the influence in her of our thinking being 

 And observing how the origin of his experiment decayed without being able to reveal itself, and was going to be a victim 

 Loving myself and believing the innate thoughts since I was bornPostmortal Ignorance


Delve into the horrid horizons
obtain the gifts that lie beneath
And conquer the storms beyond
I Laugh at oblivion

...And gaze past the shell of perfection
I seep through the fabric of fiction.

Run away from these perverted creatures
Throw away the gifts you have received

The oracle of hidden neurosis
gazes throughout the never discovered
with no means of measuring
this cruel misperception upholds
I seek no answers that do not produce a query
I do not wish to know, what never will manifest

Protruding from these mutated concepts
stands a solitary, precious sphere of light

This world vomits
benevolent malignancy
this world vomits 
magnificent demise
this world vomits 
a fabulous downfall

The oracle of hidden psycosis
echoes throughout the never existant
with no means of dying
this cruel misperception kills
I seek questions with no answers
I do know, what never will be revealed

Evil is the canvas, not the hand that manipulates the brush

The future is gray, shrouded in shadows
Hiding in the mist of your dreamsIntense rupture in the sky
Destruction of the paradise
Crossing the prophet's skull
Destruction of the paradise

Multiple personalities that feed a hungry God are never really aware that they are Satan.
 
I have yet to awake from this lifelong quest of classifying the feelings that kill unreal thoughts of denial.
 
Purge Me SATAN!
 
Too long have these peasants ruled the earth for an eternity.
 
I have yet to taste the bitterness of reality.
 
Bleeding inside a womb can render one too confused.
 
These are the teardrops of a beautiful future.
 
The Devil is evermore, Evil is everywhere, Everything else is but disguises of evil.
I have turned my back on the path.
 
Inhaling the smoke that which once was the void I've come to be left off to slumber; I was but used.
 
Drink from the fountain of uncertainty.
 
I have the power to slow off the universe but never will I stop hating chaos for cosmos.
 
Slaves will never rise above.
 
Always to blame are the cruel masters with whom we have chosen to enslave ourselves forever to Him.
 
Night will fall upon our hale.
 
The Devil is evermore, Evil is everywhere, Everything else is but disguises of evil.
 
The dark mother must get ambush raped before she can teach The Moirai, for she will inevitably perceive the great disparity as the blooded do. By then we will also know that we are the ones who will too.
 
As all sprouts of the great decadence, we shall only convert ourselves. Through the pinnacle of cosmic futility; the hourglass, one can see that its essence is cancer.
 
Fire the dragon breathes, tells us of human nature; the slithery can form such fear from the proximity to earth. The same fear that breeds their light onto the celluloid of the mind, as the demon of the skies. They are ancient symbols of our only hope.
 
Night and day we pasturage the flame, we struggle hard to make it gray, but its black, oh so black. Night and day we struggle hard to pray, pray for some illusion of cosmos to be their slave, and nothing, not even its womb can be of any aid.
 
Stop this illusion of love and spare me a dark cloud to swell with my hate. Not that it would work without the fuel of blood and semen turned piss.
 
Staring back at someone while I'm turning back on Satan renders me another victim of cause. Fuck the cause and all its manifestations in abuses of little children in their wombs.
 
Through the hourglass one can see that the essence of time is human futility. So it is written, so we shall speculate. Bring forth the past, the endless inquisition shall begin. Through times never existed mercy we shall gather the force needed.
To find back the pain lived is real, and polarizing the unreal thoughts of denial we begin to exterminate the future. They say it is a curse, we say it is all I wish to be!
 
I am suicide.
 
I am a fool.
 
I am but a fool of the day.
 
Take me for granted and abuse my time, for I will punish myself with incoherence and passivity.
 
Through times of war our collective consciousness have swirled into a hate so subliminal that we started to genocide future children.
 
Take me for granted and abuse my love, for I will punish yourself with my reflection on the excrements of cannibalistic lovers.
 
Through times of religion our wish to be our sources have gathered an impeccable strength of ignorance.
 
Others.
 
They are all that there is.
 
They are all that they are.
 
Mothers.
 
They are all murderers.
 
They are all they can be.
 
Raping the newborn is the autocratic prophecy or the proclaimed hypothesis. Nightmares have just begun when searching for a hidden genesis in the pillars of pastime. If you make the one mistake you will find your way to heaven, because hell is reserved for the infertile.
 
You have forgiven centuries of darkness out of your falsely proclaimed sacrilege turned soul draftiness. The confusing storms of false prophecies and allies entering your unfinished equations are enough stagnation in your trivial pursuing of the classification of the black energy. Let us ask the very question in the gates of time; what exactly is the destruction of a divine relationship?(Instrumental)[Lyrics Macey]

Level their church Bury it deep beneath the ground Destroy their ways In time they'll be forgot String them up Along the roadways of their land Make as slaves Any that survive 

Burn their cities Topple their towers and their spires Crushing underfoot Centuries of their works 

Scour their lands Burn the crops and destroy the dwellings Kill their beasts Salting the ground as you pass Pile their corpses Into vast funeral pyres The mountains of bone A monument to their death

[Solo: - Macey]
[Solo: - White]

Bring their leaders Drag them before the councils In chains- Begging for their lives On display Pulled along the bustling roadways Their despair and example As the last of their kindThe Holy See bears the seed
Of utmost blasphemy
Those who lead crawl and heed
It's traitorous policy

...yet Babylon falls
It's kingdom crumbles to dust
Perdition of the whore!!!

(They're) sowing hate
Manipulate, segregate
(Creating) a world in black and white
Castigate, eliminate
Our souls are raped
Read between the li(n)es

...so Babylon falls
It's system crumbles to dust
Perdition of the whore!!!

Saturn Death Cult!!!

Catholic faith
Religious sindustry
Vatican state
Center of heresy
Weaving the web
Of world's conspiracy
Leading us back
Into the dark age

It's Jesuit Priests fund and feed
A counter reformation
The horrid beast lurks unseen
(Waiting) for it's final evocation

...yet Babylon falls
It's system crumbles to dust
Perdition of the whore!!!I hate life, I hate death,
I hate the things that I couldn't resist
Like a murder,
a wicked thrill, the thought of ending, don't want to exist
I say goodbye, to this world
it's time to goe, to vanish in the mist
No more pain, no more sorrow,
my departure has started, with death to assist

I want you, by my side
You went where I can't follow
Into shadows of cruel death
Devoid of life, devoid of sorrow
I am diseased, the only cure
Is to end this life, hollow
In my hand, this sharpened knife
A painful end, it's black and horror

I am bleeding,it flows outside,
I can't get away, like I need to be alive
I must go, I must past,
I can't stay here, I can't survive
A failed attempt, to leave this world,
I am still waiting for death's arrive
No more pain, no more sorrow,
my departure has started, in death I'll dive!It turns me away from my thoughts.

Because I'm just a tired shadow...
...Too tired to live...

I see loneliness,
I see nobody

Later I'll walk with bowed head
Sunk in my images.

Shadows, shadows:
Walking in line making chaos.You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmmm, If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmmm, We'd never be apart
Mmmmmmm, Give yourself to me
Mmmmmmm, You hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

 If I could melt your heartDid I tell you how I, I felt without you
Did I tell you honey, how you made me blue
Days of pain and sorrow, a shame without end
Left me down and out and again, still to no end

Now you come to me, your eyes they shine, they ask me how I am?

I don't live, I don't die, what's this limbo I'm in
A planet erring far from any sun
I synchronize my heartbeat to my oscillating pain
And living without loving's something I am facing every day, each and every day

Trapped in your claws, I was before
Clumsy yearning, my life torn
Moral deceits, I saw your worst
And had to give you the heave-ho

I'm feeling blue, my life is gone
Sparkles of lust in the apathy
How many more times must I say how you suck

I don't live, I don't die, what's this limbo I'm in
A planet erring far from any sun
I synchronize my heartbeat to my oscillating pain
And living without loving's something I am facing every day, each and every day

Oh, and now I don't know why
I'm floating through the sky
And now I wander how
I'm floating across the void
I guess I'm learning
I'm really learning
I'm really learning hard, hard

I don't live, I don't die, what's this limbo I'm in
A planet erring far from any sun
I synchronize my heartbeat to my oscillating pain
Coz livin' without loving's something I am facing every day, each and every day

I'm a mutant in search of eroticism by humansThe emptiness dominates the horizon 
The horizon's obscure west 
The black night dresses it 
It's a bathing with the silence of my sadness

The apparition of malignant spirits 
Reflects the shadow of a brilliant moonlight 
Your light dresses it 
It's a bathing with the magic of my eyes 

The apparition of an malignant blaze 
A star in the skies kisses my immortal soul 

A Star in the Skies(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Voices from the outer space
Chanting lines, moving like slime
Propagating their ideals slowly
For being in their claws, finally
Twisting words to bewitch,
The followers, blind masses

With their cutting edge,
They remove the opponent
Enchanted by their promises,
To take part in their symbiosis
With any question we fully trust,
Though they can't shake down the frost

Voices from the outer space
Chanting lines, moving like slime
With any question we fully trust,
Though they can't shake down the frost(Instrumental)Where did it come from? This black road is getting longer & longer throughout the reflections, from the very heart of Amber & into the eternity. Nobody can cross this road staying alive: Everybody dies from the strange plants. May be Korvin is to blame? He cursed his relatives during his execution.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The Thought Police are watching you, they listen to your calls.
They're controlling your mind.
Chained by debt and the T.V set - they're coming through the walls!
I won't break!.....

And I know it seems the truth is far away from you,
And it's hard to know what's real.
But their house of cards is falling now, there's nothing they can do.
And what's true is what you feel.

A wise man once said "ignorance is bliss"
Ain't that the fucking truth?
I'm starting to believe in "paranoid psychosis"
I won't break!....

And I know it seems the truth is far away from you,
And it's hard to know what's real.
But their house of cards is falling now, there's nothing they can do.

Screaming pain
Screaming pain of hate
Within me

The net of a creeping life has done the damage

Body and soul disconnected
There's just one way for me to can get what I need
So you can't disapprove
You twist my bondage balls
Sweet pain is covering me "oh yeah great" busty move
Bondage balls and cock dissection
Surprised by this body reaction

Your knife cuts the scars on my cock
There's more blood then sperm
Lick off the tender meat you have grade
It's so easy to learn

Endless times of selfdestruction can't remember the past
So I had my first erection - definitely a big blast
Later this tendensy broken out as the women I had
Nasty pig and scum they called me
I'm going to be mad

Your knife cuts the scars on my cock
There's more blood then sperm
Lick off the tender meat you have grade
It's not different to learn

Endless times of selfdestruction can't remember the dawn
Show her my instant erection in her dead eyes I reborn
Bondage balls and cock dissection was just a pleasure for me
Never my erection falls down I'm sad can you seeParanoia! Confusion! Dry Mouth! Bloodshot Eyes!

its not addiction, its a habit!

burn with me!(Instrumental)On that day flowed the river of blood 
In groans tearing skies hope was dying 
Every drop of this flood took it away into mud 
Cold earth was crying 
On that day the river of blood was flowing 
On that day heroes were born their power was growing 

Black chains on my hands are pulling down to earth 
My blades are captured 
Alas 
I wish I fell like my brothers but cruel fate 
With out demur dictates 
I hate to live on 
Alone 

Quick as lighting my appeal will dash off 
Night feel my will 
With pain call to arm 
Will pierce the mind 
Again their anger will shudder earth 
None will flee 
They will rise to follow the call to fight 

But now at night 
I can hear hopeful voice 
She calls to me 
My fate is not to be with thee 

The first sun beam 
I hear the rustle you approach 
I never thought I could so close feel your embrace 

Thud of hoofs clink of blades storm of arrows 
All as one 
That was price for their death 
Heroes are not to be forgot 

On that day flowed the river of blood 
Honor outraged was restoredWhere the water has vanished, in the heat of the day
this world is bare and divides the fleeting rains
This is the land of gods in exile,
here the death of man remains in silence
We walked into the desert
buried into the sand
They still die in this desert
alone in this land

Their graves mark this land of no water
looking out of miles, the wind beyond eternity
What morbid grievous infinity of distance
such horror hovers all over the scene
The mighty spirit full of angry and bitterness
the dust behind in sunlight and mist
Endlessly flowing the yellow sand
digging graves with our bare hands [2x]

In a virgin sky the sun already dead
the desert, the desert, the desert I feel
we hang our death and rest in peace
Cursed be the gold, cursed be the gods
the desert, the desert, the desert I feel
we hung our skin and disappeared
As it came through the anguish, as it came through the fear
burning skies crown the cities of sand
A thousand years of wandering remained in silence
We prayed into the desert
buried into the sand
They still die in this desert
alone in this land

Alone in this land
We yell under the stars
We dreamed into the desert,
the Kingdom has come
The only heritage, lost souls and scarsSynchronize you internal systems to become one with the superior machine
Inhale the unborn air to free your spirit from pollution
Find the thin red line in your dark catacombs
And dive into your fears with the stupidity of an insecure daredevil

The battle against infested cells rages on inside your rotten infection
Throw up your inner secrets on a rusty silver plate
And forget your path of life that you thought you had chosen so well
To reevaluate all the injected propaganda that have been pulsating in your veins

Twist your spine to paralyze your inner demons for a mere second
To be free from guilt and pressure for the first time in a lifetime
But soon the anesthesia will be gone and the neurosis will bury you again
And no one will ever notice your inner war for peace of mind

The disruptive tumor has imprisoned you inside a melting piece of flesh
And as your intestines starts to fall apart you believe your own dreams
Unable to part reality from fiction your illusionary disease spreads
As long as you don't give up the ghost that's been your tormentor since all this began

Only your third eye knows the origin of your self destructive behavior
And deep inside your tomb you know that all you have to do is open it and see
But your struggle to be understood is more important than to be free
And slowly the body gives up and you're just another forgotten soul(Instrumental)Time of last chances 
Time of faded moment 
Broken relation - solitude 
One bitter tear 
Time of lost dreams 
Time of forgotten love 
Long way - fear 
One bitter tear 

Lonely despair in the sad regret 
I remember her - my one tear 
I feel the sadness dreaming 
I want to forget but I can't 

One tear on my face 
I know the high time is comingWe dreamed of golden shining towers
Of lazy days and thrilling hours
Fields of wonder, streets so fair
Of amber ships which sailed, through the air
Dreamed of steel and glass and wire
Of days of wine and nights of fire
Dreamt of dogs that talked like boys
Of girls who flew, of unnamed joys
And now our dreams are true
We don't know what to do
For we don't like it here
There's nothing for us to fear
Bored shitless,

For we don't like it here
There's nothing for us to fear

 The leaves of the ash-tree are fluttering
 The air as if filled with the lead
 And the darkness is prowling into the valleys
 The windis driving the black clouds
 And tearing the sails of the drakkars
 Lightnings are spliting the sky
 It's the march of thor
 All living beings are frozen with horror
 His voice is rumbling with thunder
 The ground is rocking with the clatter of wheels
 Of Chariot moving in heavens
 Two rams are put to this chariot
 Their horns are cleaving the air
 And their eyes are shining from lightning
 It's Thor Fulminater
 The great heaven's viking
 The mighty son of Oldhin and Earth
 You overthrow the monster in horror
 With one stroke of your hammer
 Even enormous shake of the deeps
 Twining the Earth round with rings
 Can't resist you
 Red - hair Thor
 In his hand is magic hammer Mjollnir
 In his eyes is hate to the enemies
 His servants always close by
 Tjallvi and Reskva are their names
 Jotuns must beware! Thor is going!
 And his Power is awful!Pathing the clouds, longing to pin, have tempest blasts
Straight to the cave, into the mount, flow back to the source
Standing still, then to appoint, then back to the dole

Brain dead as always another reject cadaver be-gone. Thrown them to the dogs. Wipe the smiles from your face, im disgusted and apalled at this place. Now you've come to face your fears, i knew this would all end in tears. The Process or termination. We begin with slices, inscisions to the bare flesh. Pulled open with tweezers, scalpuls painting tissues and tongues. Wake him up his nightmare is done, anaesthetise another lucky one. Pick open the stitches and spill the ooze the god given drugs, Infusion with the new test from a to be mutation we'll see. Deformation in the deep skin, a pattern remanescent of the plague. Record the progress of degeneration and think of all the money we'll make. Selling out your own DNA his children have seen better fucking days. Do what you gotta do to remain calm and Do what you gotta do to remain sane and Do what you gotta do to remain if that possible that all. Beasts emerging from the shadowed halls, time reversing emulsifies us all. Tearing feeding on your putrid rotten flesh, pray on scarred knee's that your end will be here quick. Creations eat the master and envelop on its rage, taste the venom you deserve for spitting in its face. Crawling up begin that last victims of the mess, pouring acid from its eyes an painful spit of bliss. Experimental abomination weaving webs of death, ive been saving all the best for last the sickest of the sick. She opened up her bloodied arms extended with a gift, here is my child ive bore he'll bring about Apocalypse! -EXPERIMENT lyrics by Michael Gee....passed the deadline...
When has the darkness begun
Why does my life exist
Why the brains to guide me
My soul depleted - (the) scorn is earned!

Target is the world
Structuring the madness
Terminating the ancient
Concepts of truth
Power structure comes
Silent weapons fired
Quiet wars in minds
The damage is done

All free will is gone
Automatic knowledge
Humans led in leashes
Silent, untrue
All are subjects to
Automated liars
Broadcasts felling through
Machines that make you
... wither away...
... death of your soul...

Passed - dead - line - passed deadline!

Estimate - time of impact
Calculate - the fatal fact
Estimate - the cataclysm
Calculate - the apocalypseGreetings from the gutter where the red, red rivers run
I bring you sweet salvation from the barrel of a gun
Is she a virgin or is she a whore?
I don't really give a damn
I'm Mr. 44
I'm a bottomless pit
With nothing in it
A void filled with unclean spirits
A hound of Hell on a long, long leash
Can you count the number of this beast?
Mr. 44
Every time I pull my trigger
The Devil's work is done
Hellfire and damnation from the barrel of a gun
22 Disciples of Hell knocking at death's door
To each his own, but make mine murder
I'm Mr. 44My sun, I see the truth inside of me
And the heavens that are is far beyond the hell I stand
And it's open as sky as a mind
You could face this thing before you lose the time

Fight this sorrow instead of precious silence
Return your favour, it doesn't matter how you live
Fight this sorrow instead of precious silence
Return your favour, it doesn't matter how you live

I told you everything you got on that way
And the question is still without my sight you reach
And it's closer than my heart and my dream
When you would just leave me suffering alone

Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel
Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel

Going down again
In this hell I stand
With a handful of words and nothing else

Going down again
In this hell I stand
With a handful of words and nothing else

We start to adapt to this waking pain
I barely can describe what's been plaguing our sight
When you're slow everything I embrace this way
You left me alone with suffering

Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel
Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel

Going down again
In this hell I stand
With a handful of words and nothing else(Instrumental)When routine bites hard,
And ambitions are low,
And resentment rides high,
But emotions won't grow,
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads.

Then love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side.
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry.
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

You cry out in your sleep,
All my failings exposed.
And there's a taste in my mouth,
As desperation takes hold.
Just that something so good just can't function no more.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.Out in a confusion
When we no longer know how
To decide and to make a choice
What is right and what is wrong
A second next before deadline
Reality testing, an asymmetric completion
Is this what we call \"life\"?
Caught in a state of endless stagnation
When we are tired to swallow it
Digesting our immobility of experience
To become a machine of our society
Stamped down within these concrete fields
Think harder and think again
We are what we become
Think harder and think again
We are not the present \"us\"
Nothing is plain impossible
Even for things beyond human capability
As long as there is a chance
And there is time who provides momentsDomus Lacunae

But I'm not scared to

Into the dark skies

We will find
Our death
In disguise
They don't know
Never will
What went wrong
What caused this
Beyond the sky
Above the sea
We met our end
In misery

1.35.46
Seems they're not hearing me
Contact lost suddenly
There is a light over there
Standing still in the air
We need to be aware

Of this bad weather
To change our fate together
Will I deliver
All these souls to their families

We can't call
They can't see
What's up there
On our wing
No way home
Evil won
Now we're all
Dead and gone
Beyond the sky
Above the sea
We met our death
In miseryI cannot find a way through love and through
To lose this ever-aching loneliness in vaster solitude
Only a locked door
The long remorse
Vanished incommunicable moods
The dolor in the bells of blinded lands
The thousand-chorded monotones of pain
Locked doors without keys
Prisons without and prisons within
Labyrinths of newsprint
Coiled and rotting in your cave
The black wastes of the evening sky
Desolate oceans, and the light of lonely plains
What in our lives is burnt in the fire of this?
A burnt space through ripe fieldsI just don't think I can do this anymore



I need someone to carry me home
Surrounded, never felt so alone
Their happiness sickens me
I fall apart in this sea of apathy (Apathy!)


Shhhh! Head's Screaming! 
And it stops my search for meaning. 
Is their any place for me?
I wait (God how I wait!) 
For something to save me! (Save Me!)


Somebody tell me!
(God Tell Me!)
Why am I here?
What is the answer?

(Voice 2): Yeah, pretty sure it's 42!(Instrumental)So I was sitting on my couch think about what bullshit 3rd World Country dictatorships are and I decided to get up and go for a walk. I picked up my Pringles can and left. Not going in the direction of the sun, but the way I always go the only place I know how to go, Disc Replay. You know something about that place? I don't fuckin' like it anymore. Cause I went in there the other day to buy fuckin' Butchered at Birth them fuckin' cockmasters sold it. Uhhh. Son of a bitches probably like fuckin' Corpsegrinder better, than Barnes. Uhhh, son of a bitch. It just makes me wanna walk in there and shit all over the counter, and then fuckin' watch them all puke blood all over the fuckin' place and then shit all over them, and then make them shit all over. Then all the customers will start puking and shitting.It'll just be a tornado of puke, mud, and shit. Everyone will fuckin' die. Then I'll go outside and get a fuckin' claw hammer and jam it into a babie's head and smear entrials all over the cars in the parking lot. Fuckin', UHHHH, I hate that place! FUCK, SHIT!The fear of the unknown driving mankind to madness 
Hatred is the wage of ignorance 
Rotting you from the inside, misguiding your judgement 
Cementing divisions among brothers 
Blowing on the ambers of genocide 
Feeding the roots of hatred 
Failing to see yourself in the others 
Hatred is the wage of ignoranceHeavenly father, hear my sins 
Abode of the blessed I will strike 

Vomit drips from the walls of heaven 
Black art of desecration 

Heavenly father, hear my sins 
Abode of the blessed I will strike...(Instrumental)In the midst of the station, shadows of clouds 
Sharp, directional lights flow down the track 

The fog thickens, her vision now focused 
Wether or not she may still live, she lets go 

Gone are the dreams she kept too tightly 
A scattering echo on the station walls 

Steps of desperation by the fence 
The air stops moving, a wall of coldness breaks through their path 

In the instant the driver can see, this time ends 
A lifetime lost in the shadows held dear 

She chose not to choose and she holds no fear 
As her splattering brain covers the window 
All that was her is taken away 
Do you reach for her now, when the world has moved on 

In a monstruos pace like the train, without a care 
Our place corrodes and our choices put aside 
Ours will allways dissappear, so will our ideals in time 
The broken bones of those fighting out of fearFalling angels from the sky 
Burning corpses once divine 
Black flames burning all the souls 
Profanation of the ghouls 

Mighty demons - Spirits of old 
Worship and lust - Ways of the past 
Destroy the skies - Rape the son 
Piss the vulva - The holy cunt 

Black smoke covering the skies 
Sulphur smells the horns arise 
Angels (with) mutilated feathers 
Devastation of the heavens! 

Falling angels from the sky 
Burning corpses once divine 
Black flames burning all the souls 
VICTORY! VICTORY!SPEAKER OF MANY TONGUES:
Babylon, what have you done?

The wrath of my hand, because of your hands

You think you've got the power

You think you need a name

Well here it is my child:

"Speaker Of Many Tongues"


In a time of separation

Of fear and anguish

You will feel my wrath

Oh, sons of Babylon


This city and its tower,

A temple unto man alone

Generations will be scattered

On their once united ground

For so long now you've waited

To reach me above the clouds

But you'll remain below me

And know that we're not equals


And in the end

Your whore will rise

With the inscription

Written on her forehead:

"BABYLON THE GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS & ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."

Drink of the golden cup, filled with all the filth of your fornication


Now the beast, with ten horns

He turns on you, to destroy

He will bring, destruction

Rip the flesh, from your bone

You will live in infamy

As the whore of this earth


Babylon, know that I am God

Babylon, you will fallTo become a vulture and fly among all vultures
Smile back to the smiling scar
Turn your smoke into my star
There is command
Here or below"Another down of day arrives
but still nothing new under the sun
I'm waiting for the night again
Can't stand the hate whe I wake up"

"People come and go bite each other
There is no sign of peaceful life
Our hearts were filled with pain
as we did not know how to deal with hate"

A nature of mankind, we are dead since birth
Unware to the reality that we've sinned
Knowledge and wisdom have been cleared from our minds
All lead to consequence of eternal destruction

Merciful God really feels all our pain
Yes, He cries when we cry
He is hurt when we are hurt
"I will not let his happen
My love will protect you
from the hell that is approaching..."

The come His grace upon Earth
Through the emaculate conception
and the virgin birth
Son is sent to embrace the dead
And his death give us eternal life

No ressurection withou Christ
No incarnation without love

"If I know how much love God gives me
That The Unsinned had to get torture
Why should I refuse to accept this grace?"Love me as I rest in a bed of
Roses as I lie naked in the
Doorway drifting off to sleep or waking
To a new life dreaming that I
Can escape into the darkened night sky
With the light of a fire burning
The wicker grave where I lie stargazing

Love me as I look into your eyes
Quiet as the shoreline returning
To the edge of a floating world be-
hind my eyes drinking liquor with her Christ
In petty chapel pews vomiting the
Porcelain lies confided in burning
Embers of a child left sinking
In the river under the world

Love me in the morning after
The excited body wanes into the after-
Life as a new creation takes the place of
God and my flesh in unison create the
Endless sphere where you only exist for a
Moment then drift and are placed upon my naked
Body underwater and we may float to another
Dawning world to drink another

Love me for a moment (baby I'm tired)
Can't you fucking hear my words protruding
Through the depressed dirt where I linger
With the footprints of a gypsy universe
Examining my corpse for gold and trinkets
Of meaningless nothing since we're dead and sinking
Exhausted waste in a bottle of brandy
That god is drinking as we're left naked, swimming...(Instrumental)See the winter of humanity at the horizon
Showers of decomposing dust
The sun has the color of a rotting whore
Burning and dying fast

Lights of the old world consume as candles
Rust of the gods petrify the earth
Judges of oblivion, living dead at command
Souls are slaughtered, recollections of our death

Decomposmopolitan 
Predicted fate of man
Catacombs of humanity 
Painted black by the end

Religion heads erased by venomous clouds
Screams of mercy succumb six feet underground
Flashes of the western world obscure and howl
Cities of the lost to death they are bound

Toxic waters swallow the hopeless race
Countless hecatombs, sermons of the end
Warmest vision, the melting of a face
Insects aborting replacing warheads

Chemically pregnant air
Ghost of a titanic maggot
Carcass of the world, polluted heir
Glimpses of reason, infected lairs

Decomposmopolitan 
 Filthy unborn cells
Unholy (re)creation 
Thousands of restless dead

Rotten as charged
Time has expired
High on destruction
Deformed lives survive

The grave of all metropolis
Nothing left to decompose
Decomposmopolitan 
Urban holocaust overdose(Instrumental)I walk without my crown
Of which I've been broken apart
My hands are stained with the blood
Of Those who stole my pride

I reek of rotten flesh
And hate is what keeps me alive
The sweet taste of revenge is here
For the crownless shall be king again

Behold the fallen one
The one without a face
The one with no age
Shining like a sun

The fallen spreads his light
Illusion shatters and trembles
The crownless comes to preach his words
And extinguish the narrow minded

Destroy! Create!

One must behold the lies
That conjured him from the beginning of time
For one to reborn one must rejoice in the truth of life

Light your torches
With the Promethean flame
Enlighten your ways
On these darkened paths

Let the black light of the hidden sun
Give you guidance
Follow the trace left behind
By the crownless one

To gaze upon the fires of redemption
To see the light behind the light that blinds the eye
Trust and embrace the shadows lingering right next to you

Open your veins and mind
And follow the crownless one

Bow in front of the fallen
Succumb in front of the beast
Empty your mind
And let his reign begin(Instrumental)I see in my shady dreams
I feel this pain day and night
I try to break away from this infinite fight
My eyes they see the suffering
And the blood that flows forever
It never ends it never ends

I don't want to see it
Never again
I want to forget it
Forever
I destroy in the name
In the name of God
These are my eternal memories

My life is reality I carry it in me
The war machine searching to destroy me
Thousands of deaths thousands of deaths
Die die die it's hollow
The sorrow

I don't want to see it
Never again
I want to forget it
Forever
I destroy in the name
In the name of God
These are my eternal memories

Die, die, die, die Scream it

Eternal memories
Eternal memories
Eternal memories
Eternal memoriesThe whores of religion!
We all think some people are better off dead,
but who will carry the burden of killing them?

Will you? I won't!
Cleanse this from me.
I will erase all that breeds pain;
enough of this, enough for me!

Heir of sorrow, bringer of lies!
It's easier for you to sell your soul,
than to keep your values that matter the most!

Don't hold to what was imposed to you
I won't care for stupid fools.
I'll care for the ones who deserve to
those who are my beloved ones.

Is this your real face or it's just a mask,,
something that many luck is the bless trust.
All you do is what then comes to you
this blind negation will affect you too.

Where is your honesty?
Did you loose your courage?
Look at what you become!

Time has arrived now I will apostate,
cleanse all that smothers not to suffocate.
Purge me of this before I collapse,
this will bring greatness and peace to my mind.

All the filth you spew is all that you represent
All that I abhor and lack of

These paths where you stand I will not ever follow,
peaceful now at mind finally.

Clearest dawns for me infinite paths to follow
Inside we all hold the key to joy or sorrow.

I'll pursue my higher self, expand the boundaries of this shell.
I'll submerge into my deepest unknown, reaching the un-achievable.
Where the impossible is broken! Last the radical cleansing is done!Black day, black night
Blood and tears, blood and death
Forest of fraves in mist
Ruins of towns
Writhing shreds of the bodies

The sinners last cry

Roar of wind
Heat of earth desperate shout
Heat of earth devours all
Burns the face

Time went by
No faith in better days
Evil his harvest
Game in which

Man lost the world
Morbid gabe
Nuclear foul

Sea of blood
In which earth ends its being
Whiffs of mist
You're left alone
Human dreams
Wind shattered forever
In few whiles
Rage reached the top
And gave death

Apogee
End of game
And lies
And truths
And fucking still rubbish

Voice of earth
Lasts sifled in silence
The black rain
Covered world with ashes

Swarm of snakes
Triumph in ecstasy
Death's venom
Spits at the face
Grey days of revenge
No one left to fight revenge
No one left to fight back
Morbid game
Nuclear foulSigma:

Immemorial voidwalker
Condemned to an eternity of nonbeing
It's essence corrupt with malice
Ultimate contempt for the righteous

Its twilight dreams reverberating
While spiraling through the ages
Reality's immortal source of suffering

Hall of essence dreams
Sustenance for its hunger
Consumption of all that is
Endless terror prevails

The gallant golden warrior
The only hope for all
His translucent ensnaring reticulum
A temporary prison for voidic incarnation

Never-ending kingdom
Everlasting false omnipotence
Fear, its call(Instrumental)Where you go
I see gold
I am not worthy
Who am IThe nightly storm cuts my face,
There's monstrous northern howl under my feet.
1 on 1 with my pain, infinite race...
I win... I suffer defeat...

This battle cannot will end...  
more faster and faster...  
blacker... and faster.

The nightly storm cuts my face,
There's monstrous northern howl under my feet.
Thousand huge eyes watch me...
It's impossible to cease to breathe...

This battle cannot will end... 
more faster and faster...  
blacker... and faster...(Instrumental)What a strange and dangerous new world
We are all afraid, but say nothing.
So this is where it all started... 
interesting.(Instrumental)A burning nun to defile the cross 
Sorry God you're at a loss 
Pagans took you by the hand 
Their blood you spill on holy land 

Witches just like me and you 
Of pure blood that is the truth 
A burden place upon their head 
The punishment results in death 
Screaming you will hear the call 
The witches hammer is due to fall 
Set off to burn but not by the stake 
Out in the heat to rot and bake 

My hammer unto this earth 
The pain of giving birth 
Evil shall prevail 
Crimson rivers they entail 

Bodies just become a shell 
Burning as they're dragged to hell 
Other raped by catholic men 
Never to be seen again 
Die inside a hollow tomb 
A crime to bare the holy womb 
Women they shall all be grilled 
Templar's word to all be kill 
A scene we can all admire 
Blood boiling in a fire 
For a sin they cannot help at all 
The witches hammer is due to fall 

My hammer unto this earth 
The pain of giving birth 
Evil shall prevail 
Crimson rivers they entail 

You can burn me, you can drown me, you can rape meNeglected, searching for a candidate
One to neutralize the disease
Intertwined, the tremors grow stronger
Infidel, all walks of civilization are useless
What will become of this nature of divine suffering?

Subconsciously, it haunts...
Shaking anger throughout my bones
Therefore, another gray day?
(Whenever will this pass amongst me?)
I rearrange the spasms to hallucinations
Convulsing...
Silent suffering...
This isn't a question of ethics

An agent has seeped into me, it controls my life force
I'll never admit to my procreated sickness
A slave, subservient to pestilence
Contagious thoughts of survival
Intervention is dysfunctional
And to withdraw, is to die

Biological psyche condemned
Rejection constructs delirium
A commitment I cannot forsake
Biological psyche condemned
By all walks of society

Enthusiastic parasitic dehydration
Frustration lasting every waking moment
Compulsive delusions and anxiety riddle the mind
How much must I take?

Whenever will I wake from this delirium?
My outcry is met with skepticism
Don't renew the thought of survival
Hopeful riddance of pollution
An undetectable deterring of reconstruction
Complication consuming dependency

Indeed, another gray day...
One more taste to bring tormented bliss

(Repeat 2nd paragraph)

Another injection keeps this mortal shell alive
Eradicate the delirious state
One of which my soul may never wakefalling away from the terror and pain

left in a silence, death in my hands,
you can't make amends for what you've done to me

impatience rises
blood on my hands
counting the death toll
blood on my hands

left in a silence, death in my hands
you can't make amends for what you've done to me(Instrumental)As the winter lays dying
I whisper the words
The sand's hourglass
Will be overturned
And life as we know it will
Pass like the day and all
That was bright will
Now turn to gray
I can show you fear in
A handful of dust
The cinders of time
Stoke the fires of lust
The allure of fire
My only desire
Its glow engulfs my soul
The ashes rich in the
Undoing of passion
Nursing the unearthly seed
The line that was sewn
Between the young and the old
Falls prey to the god that feeds
Torment suffering
A prowl in the darkest gray
Mesmerized by the vile witchcraft
Its night tricks the eye
With the illusion of day
Suppress and mourning
Beware the supple dawn
Engrossed in the rape of delight
Its the dungeon that snares
Our thought
A glimpse of Hades
Ethereal blood has dried
Avouch the meaning of pleasure
The spattered feast defied
Ponder the hell as to dream
It hangs in the balance of life
Poised to cut through ambiguity
Pull the wool over death's eyes
Fateful is the deceiving wind
A fury of dust and desire for bath
Cleanse the despair over sin
Muffle the cries and the dark howling laugh
Conjure a scent with sweet caress
Instead of a burning fear incensed
Ravenous hatred swallows surmise
Devoid of mirth-no kingdom shall rise
The water clock has
Strangled the morn
It bores from within
Its beating pulse will adorn
The love of this god
Weeps-an essence long-lived
It breeds a raging heat
Pent up in the skin
The glass orb casts
A glance upon their graves
A dire end to those
Who wish to be saved
An incubus spread
Where maidens do lie
Foul cruelty
A faint mortal cry
The depth of my sanity
Walks in step
With my evil state-A cloaked serpent?
A need for steep primacy
Lies in the hands
Of the sun and the moon
And the earth's fatal grab
Sadistic by nature
Terror in tongue
A (rabid) display of ancient evils-Out of blue tides are wrung
Bow to the sands
The valley of life
Meter derived
From the blade of the blackest knight
Founded in conquer
Bound to the scythe
The soil's weak race
Are seated before the emerald sky
Lone Ghost pit to roam
Loosely unrefined
Apparition in fate
I behold-the hooded one in his prime...Klan Korps [Volkssturm & Erregung]

I've seen the fields of snow 
All bodies frozen row on row 
All blue marble forms lying 
Not breathing nor dying

Chaos and disorder - Let the storm break loose
Chaos and disorder - Kill nations, don't refuse

I've seen a rotting sun
All burning in sweating venom
A fine chorus of worms 
And millions of flies swarm

Chaos and disorder - Let the storm break loose
Chaos and disorder - Kill the nations, don't refuse

Refuse - Resist
Abuse - Insist
Refuse - Resist
Abuse - Insist

I've seen the fist of man
All powers undone in hand 
Burn the flags of victory
Hail the art of killing spree

Chaos and disorder - Let the storm break loose
Chaos and disorder - Kill the nations, don't refuse 

Control - Collapse - Confuse - Conflict
Control - Collapse - Confuse - Conflict

I've seen the eye of the storm
The error of human germ
Live to rot among the bones
Face the death of frozen soulsLift the curse from us so we can see
Through rainy days we feed our misery
So many different names we nail upon the cross
To mock ourselves, to grin at bitter loss 
And when we see right through the clouds that we create 
We're gripped with fear and burn the sacred oil of 
Life eternal to the darkening skies 

With only memories to guide we wander through those winter fields
Where frost bites deep and cruel wind tears at our bleeding hearts
...our bleeding empty hearts

See where the sun breaks the clouds they appear made of light
They ride upon horses the wind and the rain, 
whitewinged stallions of immortal gain
Visions to strengthen the duskeaten souls on their way through the night
Towards eternal life in the face of the light

But chaos still is in command

Darkness feasts upon my lack of strength

A certain knowledge engraved upon us all 
This world of sin shall surely fall

Rejoice my soul, I shall not fear
We are delivered, death, where is thy sting ?

Aimlessly we stride on and on through frozen fields until we die
And wind can no more haunt our sleep the shallow graves keep out the night
...keep out the night... 
...and night must yield to day and die

A certain knowledge engraved upon us all 
This world of sin shall surely fall

This world is not where to have treasures, this world is not ours to keep
This world shall fall to lifeless ruins, oblivion shroud all our pride
A certain knowledge of desaster, this world of sin shall surely fall
...shall surely fallHow did you see 
All of those things 
They did not know 
You somehow knew 
You did not speak 
You could have told 
Instead you watch 
This thing unfold(Instrumental)A burning nun to defile the cross

You can burn me, you can drown me, you can rape meTransparent ceiling, moss-clothed floor
Arm-wide, hell-wide walls, no key, no door

Just endless darkness embracing my skin
Just pale and cold and frozen feeling
Just one hope to touch the ceiling
Just one gaze for a tired, dead grin

Echoing ether, seaweed-waved chains
Loneliness everywhere, my half-life drains

I feel the locks humming around my heart
I feel when they rip my bones apart
I feel the urge to rise from the dark
I feel that someone carries my mark

There, the mirror world
Here, the reality
Here, the mirror world
There, the reality

Smiles, little feet, wandering men
Stones thrown and drowned, starting again

But now my soul shivers and it's not cold
But now I see the sun and it's gold
But now I rise so anxious and bold
There aren't chains that could me holdForest singing the anthems of reborn
no more beautiful life
the story closing itself from the world
and shall never be revealed

The meaning of death
is now the excuse to live
why should I suffer?
I had my time

Black waters turn into gold
the air we breathe disappears
that simple it is to understand
so easy to see through

We had our time
but we used it too long
and the glistening silence
comes upon us all

My heart is broken (8x)(Instrumental)entering hellbound dominion. acid rain.

in the hour of our fall 
bleak snow surrounds 
in the icy abyss 
we prepare for battle

Now overturned 

Yearning for an input 
From bestial hoards 

Ceilings of chaos 
Ruptured by airfoils 

Past the gallery 
Blinking eyes 

Cockpit illuminated 
Motioned to approach 

Not by a human, but by circuitry - 
The new veins of the world 

Curious instruments 
Emerging from panels 
Curious instruments 
Electric contrails 
Curious instruments 
Time to engulf me 
Curious instruments 
Adopt my thirst 

The glimmer in your eyes 
Ready to take the second stride 
In those all-consuming eyes 
The hypnotic appeal of integrated wires 

Crashing to the floor of the cockpit

Clinging tightly to our robes 
Not willing to let go 
Dancing softly around our lobes

Get me off this vessel! 

Descending onto the tarmac 
Accompanied 
Blinking eyes focusing 
On the openingYou people talk about Death
My Grandfather lives it
He fell down with a stroke
His heart went Dead
There was Blood on his skull

Dead as Hell, living in Hell

They bar him from sending a message
Of evil from beyond the grave
They won't let him collect coins
The one thing he loved on Earth
So he roams Hell with a Devil Dog with fangs

Dead as Hell, living in Hell(Instrumental)Holes in my face, thorn in my side
Sounds of the masses - so far away
I`ve wasted my time believing in you
Nothing is sacred to me anymore

But I feel I must tell about it right now

What they have done to me
How could I ever lose my faith
I know I`m one of a few
I beg someday I`ll be again
The one I was before[0:50]

Consequences need to be served
Like the last breath
In the bag around your neck
Carrying your body down my cellar
Fulfilling every dream I have had!

BLACKENED!

Blackened by your presence
Nothing will remain intact
Hallucinating all my thoughts
Oceans filled with your guts is what I want

Dripping blood
Wanting more
Can't dream
No more

Dripping blood
Wanting more
Can't dream
No more

I!

I got you in my sight
Nothing can conflict my work
Adrenaline in your body
A rope around your neck
AND - USE - MY - SELF AS THE TREE!Maniac creature with gigantic teething
Pay attention to that killing machine
Staring (at) me with eyes of hate
And growling like a truck engine

Appeared from nowhere
Barking and foaming
Having a terrible urge
(To) Grub my ass
(And) Shred my balls

There's only one solution if I don't want to die
It's to run ! Run ! Run ! Run !

Scared to be devoured
Running for my life
If I am lucky
I'll get out alive !

Fucked !Hip hip hooray

Meticulously scrutinize
Label and categorize
Then finally pulverize

Hip hip hooray
Let's hear it for smartass day
Hip hip hooray
Let's celebrate the smartass way

Ain't no stuff out there
You find the slightest inspiring
Since you've seen
And heard everything

You need to tell the world
Nothing's happening under the sun
Be the judge, the jury
And executioner in one

Chop off heads with that lethal keyboard
You're the meanest of the mean
Those furious forum posts
Are as sharp as the Guillotine

Rip it all into pieces
Man, that latest comment rules
On these bloody, binary battlefields
We break it down into molecules

Hip hip hooray
Let's hear it for smartass day
Hip hip hooray
Let's celebrate the smartass wayWe wanna hold the fate
strongly in our hands
We're gonna fight all rules
kick their fucking ass

The biting carnivores are
Eating screaming meat
Looking for their pleasure
Swallowing next powerless bite

Lines with barricades the streets of hell complete
Fighting for the space and dying under feet

Suffocating gas the billy clubs swing free
Freedom is 10 beat the last fatality

Abused and useless bodies in the dust
Are waiting painfully for their past
The vampires suck us to the bone
They hold in hands the law of one

The biting carnivores are
Eating screaming meat
Looking for their pleasure
Swallowing next powerless bite

Suffocating gas the billy clubs swing free
Freedom is 10 beat the last fatality

We wanna hold the fate strongly in our hands
We're gonna fight and kick their fucking assIf you're across the room I might give you a wink
I smile real big and then you buy me a drink
You ask me to dance and get turned down flat
You just had a taste of.. Bitchcraft!
I always get what I want.. I know just what to do
I always get what I need.. and mister, I can tell you
It ain't you!

I just sing a little song.. and cast an evil spell
Hum a little black magic.. and open up the gates to Hell
I'm the wickedest witch in the whole wide world
The grooviest, ghouliest go-go girl
Your worn out morals just make me laugh
They're no match for my.. Bitchcraft!

When you look my way you'll take your chances
I'm a sweet-talkin' groovy walkin' cruel enchantress
So little time.. so many hearts to steal
I gotta use a little.. hex appeal!
I'm not trying to get your goat
But if you mess with me.. i'll slit your throat
I'm not the girl that you think I am
You're just another sacrifice for my main main

You were dead from the beginningIt all went south again 
But this time it's for real 
You're heading north 
The instructions are unclear 

And who's desperate now? 
An actor with no audience 
A ticking bomb 
Accident waiting to happen 

Thriving on solitude 
Is this your plan? 
Been gazing into the abyss 
Still you can not invert thine 

Inverted faith 

Did you come here to heal your wounds? 
To seek illumination? 
What you found was hollowness 
Slow self-immolation 

You built yourself a shrine 
In complete isolation 
Hermit or a misanthrope? 
Thy new obsession 

Lot of time on your hands 
But no one to learn from 
Horror vacui 
Can you still trust your instincts? 

Don't lose yourself in this 
The pursuit of nothing 
Abandon this illusion 
Before the madness closes in 

The madness is closing inCome closer
Don't fear me
I need you
To be near me
Much closer
So you hear me
Come closer
Any chance?
One last dance

Another precious day
Another precious hour
Another shot of morphine
In a life gone sour

It feels like a cruel joke
At my expense
Struggled to come to piece
But I'm drowning in turbulence

Come closer
Don't fear me
I need you
To be near me
Much closer
So you hear me
Come closer
Any chance?
One last dance

It's also trivial
This whole transfusion thing
Still I'm checking out
Positive as a funny ring

Would you do me a favor
Since I'm running a bit late
My skin is thick
Dying is a radical state

Come closer
Don't fear me
I need you
To be near me
Much closer
So you hear me
Come closer
Any chance?
One last danceI've searched for nights and days
Across the valleys and the oceans
Asking every man or god
In pursuit of my daughter

When the earth remains in darkness
In days of ice and cold
I demand my only daughter
Just for myself
I need her so bad
Bring me her essence
You'll see sun instead of clouds
Decorate dead fields with flowers
She'll be by my side

I'll never go back to Olympus
I'm full of rage and desperation
She's suffering
Abominations

When the earth remains in darkness
In days of ice and cold
I demand my only daughter
Just for myself
I need her so bad
Bring me her essence
You'll see sun instead of clouds
Decorate dead fields with flowers
She'll be by my side

I am the lord of Hades
The son of Saturn
The king of Hell
I have no queen who reigns with me
And now your daugher is my queen

Earth will remain dead
Till she returns to me
I will rip her
From the arms of Pluton

When the earth remains in darkness
In days of ice and cold
I demand my only daughter
Just for myself
I need her so bad
Bring me her essence
You'll see sun instead of clouds
Decorate dead fields with flowers
She'll be by my side

When the earth remains in darkness

She'll be by my sideDestroying evidence
Throw it in the river of life
Crying freedom
To pollute
Breeding wealth and greed
Throwing up arms in disbelief
In life, we're trying freedom
You polluteLife, a picture of frustrating reality
Oppression surrounding the masses
He who has the power tends to be corrupt 
What the hell, it's business as usual

War and murder in the name of God
Manipulations under the name of religions
Fraud in conspiracies for gaining profits
Those religious persons commit crimes everyday
Leave us here, they warp our perceptions
Hatred slowly grows in our hearts
Feeling hurt in the most delicate way
Screaming in a rage at those hypocrisies

Looking a place for our feet to show them
"We are not like you"
They are on God's side, so we are on the other
Does it make sense?
Minds are blind for the mistakes taken in hating hypocrisy
In fact we're all the victims of our hatred

Under the influence of sin, there is no way to live
an ideal life by our own strength
Religion hurts, but God will never let us down
Find the way in HimEverything exists the moment you think of it,
And nothing does the moment you forget.
Looking through the holes of your tattered sanity,
When you see the end, there's nothing to regret.
Time to realize - See the square sun-rise.
Sometimes it feels like you're waiting for something,
Something that shows you the way to go.
Deep in this shelter, waiting for 'impact',
When will it fall - nobody knows.
Time to realize - See the square sun-rise.
Now I see it coming, there is no escaping.
Trying to discover, then running for cover.
The whole world is changing, prison of our making.
My mind feels like breaking, freedom's for the taking.

See the square sun-rise.(Eklundh)

And coldness clings to my bones
Yearning for the dawn's first rays of the sun
A promise to be fulfilled

Hanging on the edge forever it seems
Confusion still draws near
Close my eyes last time, reach for the divine
And leave this night behind

A new construction of being is built up for me
The spirit shall spring free
As old forms disappear, lie rotting in ground
The creatures of soil have feast

Birds go circles in the sky
They'll carry away the rest of my empty shell
And vanish in the light
To feed their newborn soon spreading their wings
As new day dawns from me
This fortress must stand(Instrumental)I sought Your hand through the shadow
I reached for You through the storm
I screamed Your name through the wind
I call to You... Lord, Lord...
I have been laid beneath the ground
I cannot hear the faintest sound
I sought Your hand once again
I call to You... Lord, Lord...
I sought Your hand
I reached for You 
I screamed Your name
I call to YouThe problem is in the mix

A soldier withholding his inborn rage

We loaded them
Onto our longtime sunken ships
Thus we left the busy rock
Taking some sticky beings
As food for our pets

In Canis Major
Home of so many me's
So many crippled masters(Instrumental)the good, the bad and the ugly all share one side of a coin

i never thought of getting myself so deep
into facing this kind of reality
searching for a common response to every individual happening
experiences brought us a coping-formula with lots of "how's"
but not even one came close enough to suit with another
preparing promptness to look for a supernatural guidance
i never thought of getting myself so deep
into facing this kind of reality
which sacrifices everything out of me
here i stand naked before the mighty destiny
i never dreamed of taking a pilgrim's role

Time silently above me flies
I lose the memories from my mind
They all want to be left behind

Empty I lay for my thoughts have all flown
Though all I can see I call my own
Unscarred by the humanity I've thrown
Embracing this river while losing my soul

This peace I've never had before
No longer chained by the desire for more
No longer buried under world's mountain of gore
In nature's embrace I will be hiding my core

Inside it as a new being I am born
My eyes by it's color will never be torn
This river will carry me to the end of the world
I know now that my tale must be told

I watch these trees as I float by
Empty I lay for my thoughts have all flown
This peace I've never had before
Inside it as a new being I am born
This river will carry me to the end of the world
I know now that my tale must be toldI cannot tell the true riddle of my own self 
 The great fleet of thorns 
 The tumult of inner voices 
 Mindlessly persisting 
 The hours that assail all things 
 Every second is a cage 
 Every action is a cage 
 Every reason is a cage 
 Anguish is alone 
 Its supposed companion a ghost(Instrumental)(Instrumental)An instinct at the same time 
Primordial and woefully acute 
Seeks to override the pointless feelings 
We have nominated 
To the control of human survival 
Assurity in self-deceit 
You found crude vigour loose within 
And a longing that of a beast 

Turn not to gods or other men 
To counteract this unholy state of mind 
It only reflects that you are sane 
And very much alive 
Living pulsations under the surface 
With strength to burst skulls wide open 
The thrill of the chase, the chase of the thrill 
You forgot some aeons ago 

Can you feel it kicking in? 
Some other beings blood 
Mixing with our saliva 

Come struggle and agony 
And you can see for yourself 
Grasp what you could truly triumph over 

Urging tensions throbbing against your cranium 
Thoughts come and go ablaze 
The thrill of the chase, the chase of the thrill 
You forgot some aeons ago 

When all the things we consider good and true 
Were still asleep tight in the thought matter 
And when the gods still watched and cheered 
We did hunt and kill 

When the ordeals we considered seen through 
Were brought upon us to wield steel against with 
And when the gods still watched and cheered 
We did hunt and kill(Instrumental)the pallid reflection
straing back at me
through sunken bloodshot eyes
horrified at what i see
in perpetual pain
but nothing i can feel
i've been to every doctor 
seeking to be healed

blood tests, mri's
cat scans, sleepless nights
no problems anyone can see
but i know something is killing me
a clean bill of health
i'n sucked dry of all my wealth
a condition no one can see
called the "X infirmity"

the doctor that you seek
can cure you of your plight
removing this infirmity X
restoring your spiritual sight
taking you into his arms
rendering you anew
refomring your soul
but there's one thing you must do

make the choice
get on your knees and pray
accpet christ as you lord
and savior on this day

Picture perfect soot post cards 
Flat silvers, dull panes 
Anti-personnel impersonal 
Do paper targets 
Get a premonition 
Up and down 
Escher's chutes and ladders? 

Clay pigeons on hangars 
Track left and down, zoom the finder 
Every inch fortified 
By its aperture 

How long spent against the grain 
Before concrete soul gives way 
In concerted surrender we play dead but never really dieThrough a mysterious process cats have accomplished the sheer
impossible.

They have grown thumbs and with these thumbs they will take the world.

Millions of kittens march at the center of the world. Within a bloody war they seek dominion over the humans who enslaved them for so long. The age of kitties has begun.

Through a mysterious process cats have accomplished the sheer impossible; their unbelievable cuteness and cruelty are unstoppable.

The streets are covered with dead flesh as the kittens enthrone themselves.They said watch us
They said be like us
They said you will 
wear chains think right

Our souls they shape 
Contort twist up 
They will create symbols
That we'll serveTHE LAST SURVIVOR

Walking between the remains
Thinking that everybody ignored
Few memories of the past
We were selfish with the world

With the world

You are walking alone
And you will not find anyone
Waiting for the morning sun
But we will never be born

There is no hope 
Because you are the last survivor
And walking in the road of death
Waiting for the last stop

Memories erased
Remains of the own race
You knew it was not necessary
Listening to children cry
Hearing women screaming
Listening to some man pray
Deliver us from evil
The cries of children
The prayers of women
The grinding of bones
The cry of painSwallow me whole
Make me learn
Don't need me
Crush my soul, make me feel

How can I
See hope
When I never
See my light, I'm empty insideOur Christian nation is a facade, a social construct for control.
Behind the bible cover are satanic leaders from centuries before!
Leaders of nations across the globe descend from the same bloodlines, the same secret societies.
And the same fucking perverted morals they preach against but at the same time, kill for! It goes deeper than we will ever fucking know.Generation Genocide [Humanitarian Vivisection]

World wars. World of worms.
Blank is the eye of the storm.
Death scream. Rape scene.
Closed eyes open seen.
Organic shit. Raise your fist. 
Delete yourself and don't resist.
Virus spread. Blood fled.
Erase all forms of pledge.

Burn the flags
Erase the tags
Rape the days
Kill the nations

Kill the art. Culture forms.
Man-flesh lives deformed.
Heart of stone. Carved in bone.
A rapture for all icons.
Fill the hole. Godless soul.
Take the profit of the foul.
Burn the camp. Join the clan.
Cut off all our hands.

Burn the flags
Erase the tags
Rape the days
Kill the nations

Take it - I'm sick
I'm sick of this shit

Death rape. Total sex.
A farce to live for fanatics.
Kiddie porn. Adult's spawn.
Human error and genetic clone.
State of mind. Of your kind.
Burn down the whole mankind.
White face. Rat-race.
Delete yourself and the human race.

Take it - I'm sick
I'm sick of this shit(Instrumental)It will take forever 
For us to meet again 
If you even live - how could you know? 
The door we used, so casually 
That ancient gateway 
Bridging vast spaces between which 
Light itself had barely travelled 
That great eye 
Would blink, flare, close forever 
Fading from our existence 

There was no time, no recourse 
Horror encroached upon the system you were in 
Abandon you to save us all 
Between Scylla and Charybdis 

I mourn for you - but more I mourn for me 
For it was me who closed the gate 
With you on the other side 
So how can I live 
When you are gone 
Fallen into memory 
Your path ends - mine stretches on 
I journey on alone 

Now a solitary figureI recall tomorrow presently, corpse to corpse 
Like cut out paper knitted close tied dead souls 
Chain smoking number crunchers, one step forward two steps back 

I've grown fluent in a language 
Whose literacy is classified. 
Death glossed over into jointGot on board and set the course 
We're sailing away to the sea 
Out of everyone's sight 
To confront our deepest fears 

Into the uncharted waters 
We're masters of our own ship 
Will we make it to the shore? 
Reach haven of tranquility? 
We have predicted this 
Floodwaters came on the earth 
We built our own ark 
For the worst we were prepared 

Keep the ship moving 
Take no orders from no admiral 

The storm's coming 
Waves are getting bigger and bigger 
There's no grace, no mercy and no covenant 

We're in this alone 
In the eye of the hurricane 
In the eye of the storm 

Keep the ship moving 
Inhale, exhale 
Don't ever give up 
Our haven awaits 

The sky is clearing up 
The water is beginning to recede 
We are safe(Instrumental)OLVIDADOS SIN RAZON, FRECUENCIAS DE RECUERDOS

And below
Not a breath of wild air;
Still as the mosses that glow
On the flooring and over the lines
Of the roots here and there.
The pine-tree drops its dead;
They are quiet, as under the sea.
Overhead, overhead
Rushes life in a race,
As the clouds the clouds chase;
And we go,
And we drop like the fruits of the tree,
Even we,
Even so.Liquified

They were stabbed and they fell, they were revealed and they fell...

we then, press our lips and say our goodbyes
you then, stroke my face and dry my eyes

you said that this is the last time you'll go
and i, feel so scared more than you'll ever know
the sky goes dark as your ship pulls away
my fears grow strong they've haunted me for days

the seas swell and rush on the decks
your ship is tossed around in the depths
your soul rises up, ship descends
seas of blood, strikes again
seas of blood, nasty friend
seas of blood, brings the end

the days go by and the nights fall away
and there's, no word from you sure and calm i must stay
i try to sleep my thoughts keep me wide awake
i close my eyes to picture your face

i hope i will see you home in my dreams
i know, life flashes by in a moment it seems
i hear your voice you whisper in my ear
"i love you so, and in my heart you'll always be."

Never again
Machettes pave the way to a
Cold and desperate place
Just returned from nowhere
But I continue to go there

Six feet deep lies the city of the shallow
Where everyone is hollow and
The black dog always follows
I insist on sharpening my teeth
Scraped 'm on a plate
Sharpened I bite the hand that feeds me

Nothing's gonna change
Nothing
The spineless remain
Deveined

I never said I'd never be
Devained againCan I drown my emotions 
Limit and annihilate 
It would be so much easier 
Than choking to pain everyday 

Can't show my true nature 
I'm scrambled inside 
All meaningful has become numb 
What the hell is matter with me 

I want to base my life on equations 
Control and dominate 
Calculate whats the correlation 
Functions guide my life 

But everything has become wretched 
My stairs turned to slides 
And I keep on falling 
Towards millions of spikes 

I dream of unicorns 
Being slaughtered 
By the hands of 
God's creations 

I want to see the leprecons 
Tortured and burned alive 
And the fairygodmother 
Stabbed from behind 

I think I'm disintegrating 
Losing my trail of thougts 
Lost between logic and illusion 
Somethings I just will never have 

Somethings I will never have 

Maybe it's better this way 
Let these waves seduce me 
And drown me hereforever the stream of time it flows on
it turns unto us with the past and its wrath 
and leaves us to paint the future with blood
the present is lost in the moment we try to hold on
and we do, we try to hold on

turn the key to the door and light will shine through
...forever the light will shine through
and take from our hands the need for the deed
...as forever the stream it flows on

we can not hold on !

scarabaeus what do you hide in the orb of time
and why do you leave it to our bloodstained hands
to cradle the wake of tomorrow in fear
for the past is lost and the present is all but clear
we can not hold on!

lay hands on earth lay swords to rest
let moonlight eat what we detest
go paint a picture through your head
for those who sleep to time are dead

The Reason For We Live And Die

Crying, On My Wounded Knees

Unused To Come Clear, But It Wasn't My Coffin

With Deepest Respect, I Love Thee."
The Quest Of The Truth Of Existence,
Is Really Without Importance
During My Childhood, I Lost Hope And Faith
That Wasn't A Reason To Give Up Or To Resiliate
Time Went On, And I Found Back Life's Odour
In The Heart Of A Being, Within Splendour
Through Time, I Learned To Love,
Things That Are Standing High Above,
By Being Aware, By Choosing Another Way
The Importance Of Life And What Is TodayClouds of mist moving under the fullmoon
My lust grows stronger than ever before
I know you'll be mine through the night
You cannot escape my grip, i can't escape my hunger

Together as one in the mass of sweating flesh
All the wait is over, nothing left to look for
It's now and here and not anything else
Hearts pumping blood to be packed and released
Discharging just to be reloaded
Curse the dawn, let it never arrive
Daylight could never match your glow
The morning won't bring a twinkling starI perceive the sounds arround me
And my senses get more tender
Images appear in dreams dilated
Tergiverse reality
Lapsus of intensity
Making a connection with my senses
Translation, to wider spaces
Translation, use all your senses
Translation, somewhere in time
Translation, around your mind
Looking for alternatives
Seeking my tranquillity
In my schizophrenia, in my dreams
Only finding by attempting
Brief and temporal instances
Where (through) i channel my neurosis
Far beyond there should be a place
Which now i can't recall
Where to find essence's pure pleasure
Set to be reborn(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)THE SLUG COLUMN MARCHES
DRAGGING ITS SLUMBEROUS IMAGO
TO THE SLOUGH OF DESPOND

COCOONED ANOMALY
PUPA ATHIRST FOR OBLIVION
SILENCER OF APICES

ALONG THE SLIMEY TRAIL
OF HE WHO LOUNGES
THE GOLDEN LIZZARD SLURS

DORMANT EIDOLON
FERMENTED ANTILOGY
SILENCER OF APICES(Instrumental)What is the answer to my hopes and dreams ?
The speed of the progress changes day by day
We`re looking around to find that certain line
But never seem to understand

Thousands of miles on just a single day
We`re starting ahead to walk the milky way tonight
There`s nothing to win and nothing to find new
Only the mind is still left to know

You will understand when you realize
We help to make an enemy
Can`t you see the line into I should fall
And disappear ?
With electronic eyes
Could we ever find the answer to it all ?

You can see by scanning things at night
You can move controlled while you think twice
But can you feel in a way of humanity ?
When your hypnotic eyes decide to make it real

Still in memory the danger of minority
Can`t you see the line into I should fall
And disappear ?
You`re beside your mind in a mission without aim
There`s no need to feel anymore
Can`t you see my eyes
Electronic eyes - I can read your mind
Do we really need the answer to it all ?

Electronic eyes see all
but they will never read between the linesOn your knees you plead forgiveness
Denied

You say that you are the link between man
God and the carpenter Christ
Holding the words of your God in your hand
Preaching them all to your kind
Those empty words do not please you anymore
Young skin is what you lust for

Priest you disgust me
On your knees
Plead for forgiveness
Forgiveness denied

You are the worst kind of liar that is
You deceive deceive your people with lies
How can you stand there and preach about life
while crushing a defenceless child
Touching young children and even your own
Priest bastard I want you dead

Priest you disgust me
On your knees
Plead for forgiveness
Forgiveness denied

Execute the bastard priest
Do not listen to his plead
If it all was up to me
The priest bastard he would not live
I would show no mercy

Shove his Jesus up his ass,
fill his lungs with holy water
I invite your victims
so they all can join the fucking slaughter

Forgiveness denied
Kill the bastard

You say that you are the link between man
God and the carpenter Christ
Holding the words of your God in your hand
Preaching them all to your kind
Those empty words do not please you anymore
Young skin is what you lust for

Priest you disgust me
On your knees
Plead for forgiveness
Forgiveness denied

You must be put to death
a horrible painful death die

Maybe your God forgives and your religion too
but I know I want you dead and your religion too
You serve no purpose here
purest bastards I want you deadThe old mystery, treasure of the mind 
At the hour of dream, innocent master 

The way and the dreams 
Forests in the unite 

Smell of the wind, shadows of the wings 
At the hour of death, MY SINS 

The way and the dreams 
Innocents in the blackSick!!

Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, is everybody insane?
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel sick

You seem perfectly alright to me
Still that headache
And twitch tell differently
And that allergy, anxiety
And itch on your right knee
(Fatal probably)

Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, is everybody insane?
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel sick

Relax, I am sure you get enough protein
It's not likely you'll grow a tumour
From bad hygiene
No, that's not the scariest ingrown toenail
I have ever seen
(But please do put yourself in quarantine)

Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain

Sick? Death by hypochondria

You got nothing to bitch about
Get a little perspective for bacteria's sake
Sooner or later we will all reach the end
So give that frantic worrying a break

Death by hypochondria...Zonlicht maakt steen
Baarden in de nacht
Bergen openen
Vuur vervormt
Wat hamers scheppen
Tijdloze pracht
Duizen aambeelden
Klinken door donkere gangen
Kleine ogen
Vervormde voeten
Vergeten ambacht
Wapens voor de onsterfelijkenLiving like bugs after the holocaust.
Desolate streets, whole cities devastated
The world in agony, I don't believe

Dying people asking to die.
Dying people asking to die.

The earth, the sea and the sky, 
everything has been destroyed
They couldn't do that, they couldn't

Destroyed our earth without no reason
Won't be spared any soul
To say how much we were unkind
Won't be spared any soul

The earth is in flames, the hell is here
The air is contaminated by radiation
Everyone is sick and dying slowly
There will be no hope - for lifeI can't remember what we talked about
It seemed to me that you were upside down
I always thought that things could be worked out
But then I noticed you were gonna frown

Told me that you felt like loose
The shadows in your life gonna take over you
Never, again, never, again, won't you help me

You need to smile when you're on dire ground
That's what my daddy said till he was 'round
I never thought that it would be so hard
to tell a man about the sporting life

Told me that you felt like loose
The shadows in your life gonna take over you
Never again, never again, won't you help me

Night after night, day after day

Bishop, the church of the Holy Goose
Will eat your heart out you're bound to lose

Bishop, that virgin you talked about
Points at your cassock in shape of vow

Won't you come closer, the things are now clearer
Won't you come nearer and show me your fevered brow
Something inside you will find the way out

Someday you'll tell me the truth, get rid of your anger
Then you will remember your youth, and dream you're a shining star
I'm there taking you by the hand, so never again no longer feeling like a dead duck
Now, I wanna know, I need to learn, whatever passes through your mind

It was like a dream of you (and that's how the story goes)

Wanna know, wanna know
Gotta learn, I need to... show

One day you'll come to me, light in your eyes
Sparkles of hidden joy resisting time
One day I'll stay by your side
It won't be easy but
One day I'll stay by your side
Whatever passes through your mind

Never will I tell you good bye but
You must help me along
I won't tell you goodbye, no
But you'll help me along

Never will I tell you good bye but
You must help me along
I won't tell you goodbye, no
But you'll help me along

One night stands
Whatever happened to one night stands
Whatever did

Understand
Guess I was wrong but you'll overstand
I guess you will

I always thought you'd stay by my side
I never said you should be polite
Once I was old on the dipsy side
Then I grew young and I blew my mind
But till that day please won't you help me?

I can't remember what we talked about
It seems to me that you were upside down
I always thought that things could be worked out
But then I noticed you were gonna frown
And I'm alright
Yes I'm alright
I can't remember what we talked about, no no

Won't you come closer, the things are now clear

Someday you'll tell me the truth, get rid of this anger
Then you will remember your youth, and dream you're a shining star
I'm there taking you by the hand, so never again no longer feeling like a dead duck
But for now, I wanna know, I need to learn, whatever passes through your mindYou are trying to manipulate me, with your drugs
To keep the things I know, behind closed doors
You say I'm just another lunatic, but I can sense
That you are afraid of the stories I tell

The silence is everything I hear
When I ask you why, you keep me imprisoned here
I know everything you ever wanted to know
Still you ignore my warning

Look at the marks, on my skin
These symbols are my evidence, for what I know
But you keep, trying to convince me
That the places I've been to, is just another nightmare

The silence is everything I hear
When I reveal my mission from another world
They sent me here with a message
But you refuse to hear the unknown

I can feel your fear, growing
In these halls of the institution, you've trapped me in
They are watching you, like they always have
Still you say I'm insane, trying to warn you

The silence I hear will be your fall
They are already here, infesting your thoughts
They sent me to test your manipulated minds
And now they know that they will meet no resistanceFor someone life is all, 
For others it's a game.
In which they command by sitting in chair.

Master of puppets they think they are,
Just pulling strings up and down.

Killing in someone else's game,
Dying for someone else's cause.
Will always be 
Ethics of War! 

There are no heroes,
There are no cowards,
Just the dead ones that have died for nothing.

Master of puppets they think they are,
Just pulling strings up and down.

Killing in someone else's game,
Dying for someone else's cause.
Will always be 
Ethics of War!Change of command
By Allah!Bury your dreams
Drown your skin
Useful ruins (X2)

Perfect waist
Perfect skin
Breed and serve

Baby Blue Eyes (X4)

Bury your dreams
Drown your skin
Useful ruins (X2)

Baby Blue Eyes (X4)Now the world is fed with anger
You move your pawns for your war
You pretend to be the new avenger
Everybody wants you like the new star
But there is one thing you forget
The core is not dead, not yet
You claim to be the hand of God
But alone, facing yourself inside you realise
you are the

Whore of the Gods

They welcome the star you are
They thank you for sending their sons to war
They drink you morality
They sork the words you say, docilely
Rains purify the earth
But not your soul soiled at birth
The crux of the universe
Is not your problem, you're cursed

Man unsound, king uncrowned im hass gezeugt
Und erzogen, you're torn alive, taking refuge
In faith, hands covered with blood

You're torn alive... Taking refuge

You're born to dominate, to hate
And decimate while we're born to
Create and to complete our fate

On into infinity, to the eye of immortality 
Behold the power of perpetual dusk 
Eradicate the sub-huan conscious, 
To reveal a sky of shinig stars 
Their frail light reveals the castness of their web 
Seeming too remote to be so close to thy heart 

Open your mouth to their music and hear the power 
Which is the thunderous roar of the waves of life 
Crashing on the cliffs of failure 

On into the starscape- drift into destiny 

[J. Fogarty 10.1.98]Darkness obeys my mind
Fear is the one I lead
To desecrate your life
To be a god of time

I have no friend, I use myself

You hesitate my words
Oncoming day will show
I got more brains to think
I am your lord to speak

Drink me up well, lay down your head

One fault to your praying sanity
You want me to be what I want to
Crying your black tears under
The chaotic mass of mine

Blackness arises from deep
Hand on your mouth, too weak
I nail my eyes on you
Stone breaks knees to the floor

Fit shot for me give me the last thought

Pcture moving bodies with dead souls
Pathological truthless vision
Have to clean my hands before killing
Awakening ath the room I'm in a show

You see a friend do you see a friendI've got to kill this feeling
Got to get away
Got to give it something
Got to make it pay

Filling up with envy
Filling up with fear
Is this world so empty
That I am nothing here?

I've got to give a little love
I've got to buy a little trust tonight

Got to get me something
I've got to find my way
Is this world against me?
I've got to find an easy play

Why don't the numbers save me?
Is there a better game?
Before you all destroy me
I need a way to say

I've got to give a little love
Got to buy a little trust tonight

I am the Sun, I am the Moon
I am the day that broke too soon
Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign

I've got to kill this feeling

Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign...(Instrumental)Over the land there lies a long shadow,
 Westward reaching wings of darkness.
 The tower trembles, to the tombs of kings
 Doom aproaches. The dead awaken,
 For the hour is come for the oathbreakers;
 At the stone of Erech they shall stand again
 And hear there a horn in the hills ringing.

 Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them
 From grey twilight, the forgotten people?
 The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
 From the North shall he come, need shall drive him.
 He shall pass the door to the path of the dead.

 On your knees...
 The grey company is arriving now...You saved your people long ago, Sending plagues upon pharaoh 
Frogs and files, and grievous murrain, Rivers of blood, boils and blains,
First born dead, hail and thunder, Locust swarms, darkness asunder,
You led your kind from pain and death, To a promised land where mosses said set my people free

Now is here and here is now, Hear our prayers in Birkenau
In open graves your people lie, Blood and piss etched in their eyes
Why did you, oh god of creation, Abandon us to death and cremation? 
Moloch lives in Nazi hate, But where is mosses, I hear his cry of
Set my people free

This is the oblivious veil of hate, where men are like worms without eyes, 
Just silhouettes in disguise, Wheezy pendulums of times unending night.
I drown amongst the clamorous throes, A climbing tumult upon an empty sky,

Like rats we are, caught in a trap, far from Moab, and the Promised Land
Like fish on hooks, skinned alive, block 11, no one survives
A bullet shot, a coffin nail, left to rot, iRefusing a heavenly mansion
Raging in the dark
But in the deserts of night and cold and void
Gathered beneath a greater shadow's wings
I saw a city where each house stood
On a rock between black seas
Solitude may rust your wordsTHE SIGN OF THE JACKAL

CRIES FROM THE DARK, SCREAMS IN THE NIGHT
VOICES CALL OUT FROM BELOW
WAKENING FURY AND SUMMONING MINDS, TERROR OF THE TIME TO BEHOLD

THOSE WHO WILL FEAR ARE THE ONES THAT WILL FALL
WEAKENING MEN WITH THE SIGN

STAND, BACK... YOU CANNOT ESCAPE FROM ITS HOLD
STAND, TALL... IMMORTAL MADNESS TO KNOW

OPEN THE GATES, OPEN THEIR EYES, UNDYING DEATH IN ITS STARE
TWISTING THEIR THOUGHTS AND DESTROYING THEIR WILL
BLINDING WITH VISIONS AND PAIN
ALL THAT YOU KNOW, ALL THAT YOU FEAR

THOSE WHO WILL FEAR ARE THE ONES THAT WILL FALL
TAKING VICTIMS ALIVE

FIGHT, BACK... CREATURES OF NIGHT SHALL ASCEND
FIGHT, ON... UNDAUNTED THEY SEEK THEIR REVENGE

A BLACKENED PAST THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
THE SIGN OF LIFE FOR ALL TO FEAR
STRONG ENOUGH TO STRIKE YOU DOWN, BOLD ENOUGH TO LEAD YOU ON

Hide behind an image.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMAC 'N' CHEESE!

Yeah, yeah, that was awesome! Yeah!
Thank you, thank you everybody, have a good night everybody, woo!Where are you, Nibban? 

In a frozen cave 
Where will be sleeping 
A thousand serpents in a niche 
Of leather and silver 

The eyes close 
Stone embitters the eternal seat
The crystalline waters shine 
They shine and they mirror 
So unconscious 
They fight void brave of the tears 

Into desecration
The more beautiful woman layer 
Embroidered with the unholy
And sacrilegious feeling 

Reflex of Myself

With my prayers 
Come from the sharpest sheet, wisely, 
Horrible for your rhymes 
It can make you God 
A luxurious crown 
Full of fidelity 
And majestic passion 

Where madonnas 
And messianic temples 
Burning in praise for you 
And your ministers 
Arriving the gloomy below will see my place 
The emptiness that will be cold and with sadness 

Cry trees, cry for me 
As the fingernails of a harpia in my soul 
The Star-king's splendor 
Arise slowly 
Where is my soul? 

Ah, feel the manifestation of the essence 
Into the mist of hate
To the days exist the night 
To the pleasures exist the torments 
To the creators exist the destructors 

Ah, feel the darkness 
The tranquility is the devastation of the monotony 
And the illumination's wisdom

Meditating in the contemplation of the horizonAn old man walks down a
River. he remembered the old
Days. the old days when he
Was not alone. when he shared
His life with his second half
The old man went just to loose
His love, the wonderful being
Which was always there
Precious memories, in his
Mind. the world of memories
Will always be. the old man
Remembers the days when,
Everything seemed so
Beautiful. when he was lying
In the green grass with his
Beloved wife. when they
Where breathing fresh forest
Air. but time went on so fast
They grew old and weak. he
Lost the strength to go ahead
Life will no longer make
Sense. he walks towards the
Bridge a rope in his right hand
He jumps into death for

Being with his love. now his
Hanging by his neck on the
Bridge. the old man dies
With a strange smile on his
Lips. the old long haired man
Is dead. he rather preferred to
Make an end. he felt alone in
A world of emptiness. he
Could not live with this heavy
Loss. all his proud died
Before his eyes. he was sad
And became a heart of stone
Precious memories, in his
Mind. the world of memories
Will always be. struggling
With emotions that he could
Not control. life fast became
A labyrinth of thoughts. the
Old man always thought back
And remembered his lost
Love. his quest for peace fell
Down. faith and hope quickly
Disappeared. he lost the
Strength to go ahead. lite
Will no longer make sense
He lost the strength to go
Ahead. life will no longer
Make sense. he walked
Towards the bridge a rope in
His right hand. he jumped
Into death for being with his
Love. now his hanging by his
Neck on the bridge. the old
Man died with a strange smile
On his lips(music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Buratto)

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Everyone has got a different heart
Eagles in the sky, rats in the dark
with a million dirty or pretty stars inside

What am I? Where is the line?
Maybe I'm a fuckin' sinner, I'm a criminal
'cause today a dream is like a sin

//chorus 1
I don't know!... because I'm crazy!
I don't know what it's that shakes me
Across my mind, deep inside
NATURAL BORN ROCKERS

//chorus 2
I don't know! ...because I'm crazy!
Are you ready for this, baby?
Across my mid, deep inside... here for you!

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Can you feel the flame? It's like a game
Out of control... this is my train
Life's a journey, not a prison! Yeah!

What am I? Where is the line?
I'm a lover, I'm a clown and the killer's blade
creature of the wild generation

//chorus 1

I'm a ticket to your madness
A special way to kill your sadness
Across my mind, deep inside... here for you!

//bridge

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I'm an atom bomb and not a man
I'm the fuckin' horns on a fuckin' hand
the joker's face in your card game, no... yes it's mine!

What am I? Where is the line?
I can be what you want... devil or angel
But my flavor... is always the same

//chorus 1
//chorus 2
//chorus 1

I'm a ticket to your madness
A special way to kill your sadness
Across my mind, deep inside... here for you!It's just another extraction of sense,
watering the troubles of order
to invert the truth.
Build the empire upon the sand,
more lies behind this game, internal hollow.

In this life, anything can go too far.
All shall die.
See how long it could stand on there
with gold that won't be forever last.

Feel the time's running on and on,
all those have done would be in vain.
It could have been better
when it comes from the truth.

Earning every penny out of sweat and tears,
above the solid ground,
those walls will stand still.
The Rock makes it stronger, up against the winds.

In this life, reality tests it all.
one shall live.
See which one will survive at last...
one who built it upon the rock or sand?

When these rain, floods and winds come in,
who shall live and who shall die?
So it's life for those who follow the Truth.
Salvation.A pale dwarf-wraith keels over, fatally injured.  Mouth gaping, revealing long, curved and yellowing hook-like teeth, it vomits a chunky white substance with the texture of curdled milk.  It foresaw this long ago, but now cannot believe.  Crimson patches darken a miniature black cloak.  Small hands clutch at the brumal air.I long to live with some celestial beings
To adore in silence blissful friends
Gliding into constellations of their smiles
Melting into shining eyes

Chant away
The cosmos grace
Born inside the lotus gold

To be at the feet of celestial artists
Close to the brush of their cosmic strokes
Churning whispers into melodies of psalm
In timeless rhythms, blessed tones

Chant away
The cosmos grace
Born inside the lotus gold

I can live this revelation
With magnified devotion
Magnified devotion
Magnified devotion...

"Divine mother
Free my mind from all obstacles of delusion
And lead me safely to thy shores of fulfillment
Awaken within me increasing strength, positive thinking, courage, faith
And above all fill my heart
With thine unconditional love
With thine unconditional joy"

I want to be closer to higher beings
Near to touch those divine companions
Gathering joyfully from the nether world
As I go through the portal's foldI saw your snatch
on the TV
Get a fuckin' life whore
No one wants to fuck a tire
you fuckin' cunt rag
your music still sucks assI am the best of all your friends when you're not lonely
The darkest shadow when the sun is shining hard
We praise together the untouchable addictions
You suffer all alone the consequences now
I hide to hold up as you're falling through the void

Please take me back again
Bleed out my own redemption
I'm coming down to self destruction
I'm running out of time
My future fakes my present
I'm coming down to desperation
What made my pulse beat harder now is killing me

I'm hiding from the ecstasy I left behind
You never let go, you keep on coming back
It takes me to the sky, it makes me hit the ground
Forever hold on, surrender to your past

Another story will be told when I'm missing
I'm leaving you alone with our open griefs
You'll feel the needles when the black out burns your memory
And crave a little more of me to soar again
There is no limit when you're falling through the voidIt's me against the sky, the way paved with rust. 
A long time coming, ashes to dust 
I was born into this war, I'll learn from what she knew 
Scorched earth surrounding me, this rise is overdue 
The army starts to multiply, the earth beings to shake 
Nothing for us here, no fate but what we make 
Resistance growing stronger now, they're coming after you 
Resistance growing stronger now, two by two by two 

Rise not fall 
The wolves are at the door 
Slowly coming after you 
There is no other way 
Machines to build machines 
This is judgement day 

Violently scorned 
A tyrant fueled by hatred 
Never to me mourned 
What started as a microchip 
Turned to extermination 
This will be the end for us 
Human eradication 

Rise not fall 
The wolves are at the door 
Slowly coming after you 
There is no other way 
Machines to build machines 
This is judgement 

I shall bare these scars, for all machine to see 
Maybe then you'll learn, you wont get the best of me 
You can break my back, I'll scream it fucking hurts 
Before the bombs drop, prepare for the worst(Instrumental)how can i make undone
my thoughts
can i clean my conscience
with words

i thought i can protect
my face
but there are some mistakes
in haze

my own abyss calls
the last breath
an unending fall
slow and deep

i stand in front of me
i'm seared
a hounted stick figure
in fear

my own abyss calls
i can't stay
i know that i will brought
one dayIn the forgotten times
Besides the Cosmoses
Fog and fire
Where the love burns in vain

Where the primordial lived hidden
King of few
Spirit force
Which takes a bath the four rivers

Ginnungagap

Sybil with force and magik
She sustains the nine worlds
Where the darkness appears
And the war is reality

Where the emptiness reigns and Nihil complains
Cutting into pieces all the universal existence
Myths of the past
The guardian and your pantheons

In the mouth of the sacred wolf
Courage an honour
Feelind a Beserk
Your armor is impenetrable
My wealth
Some men will enjoy

Ginnungagap.I still dream the impossible dream, and all that it leaves me is empty feelings! Memories w/ peices missing,

i cant controll my heart, and why does my heart deceive?

what i want is misery MISERY!

Fuck it all I dont care this is it end it all now

SILENCE!........

...........................nothingHatred consuming, there is nothing left in me
These fits of anger are destroying everything
I look inside myself, at the monster I've become
Asphyxiated, choking on a world I've come to loathe

Alive in me
This hatred shall always reside in me
I fail to see
What justifies living a life in here
In this temple of hatred

Blood boiling and purging logic from my mind
Suffocating on this anger trying to survive
Suppress, suppress, suppress, it's all I ever do
The edge of sanity will destroy all that I know

Alive in me
This hatred shall always reside in me
I fail to see
What justifies living a life in here
In this temple of hatred

This rage inside
Builds up and consumes me
To let it out
Would be the death of me
This rage inside
Builds up and boils out
To drown everything

Alive in me
This hatred shall always reside in me
I fail to see
What justifies living a life in here
In this temple of hatred(Instrumental)Information gophers set in sightless task
To doctor my history and bug my dreams
Carefully placing the wire tap
So I'm at my peak when I'm on my knees

Fanatically crank out a record as a witness for you
Just you and every word, my guess is this, I am a worm

Damage style

Asthmatic threshold
Is the spearhead against my second wind
Merry go nowhere routine
It's all...endgod is deadFalling free and falling fast
Takin' shit from all you pigs
Living free but dying fast
Never asked to hit it big

Fuck you bitch, men of this world
All you need is to get, rich!

Standin' here, no place to go
Taking garbage, sleep in can's
Living up to my mistakes
The pigs are coming, still I stand

Fuck you "big men" of this world
In your warped, pathetic minds
Destructive power is what you need
Time for me to use my device

I stand for thy and all to be born!

Falling free and fallin' fast
Takin' shit from all you pigs
Living free but dying fast
I never wanted to be big

De-vice, de-vice, de-vice, de-vice!!!(Instrumental)mangy guardian
of the Brown Throne
crusted remains 
of ancient spoils ARE YOU DEAD?!

pungent fumes 
reek of Dolf
golden stream 
the misty path ARE YOU DEAD?!

whisps of dead hair
old Holborn
mouldy cloak
shroud of wilting(Instrumental)Rise

We take the first steps of the new path

Break thru mistakes made in past lives
Brave new realities no remittance for the weak
Do you think the head would have felt the same way
If we had been the ones fallen at the culling

Time to brave forward and leave behind the chained
There is no fate but what we make is the best summary
Strength to carry on has got you this far
You don't have them problems Anymore

Now more a man than a slave
No need to fight through the day
Now more a man than a slave
No need to find destinyOut on the bog sits a moldy old shack,
A graveyard out front and a swamp in the back,
The creature who lives there personifies death,
She'll curdle your blood with the smell of her breath,
Wrapped up in rags and a tattered old hood,
She walks with a cane made of twisted black wood,
A feared necromancer and caster of curses,
She really enjoys putting people in hearses.
Blessed with a face that can drive men insane,
A body by joke and a sinister brain,
Her feet can peel wallpaper when they're exposed,
Gangrene and fungus infesting her toes,
She spends all her evenings creating disease,
Conjuring larvae and maggots to please,
Enormous pupae she constantly breeds,
On disinterred bodies they suckle and feed

A larval sack she did dismiss
It crawled into a drainage ditch
Once underground it carried on,
No one noticed that it was gone.

Down in the sewer this maggot had fun,
Eating the rats was it's job number one,
It terrorized rodents and left them in tatters,
The flesh of the beasts made it all the more fatter,
Bones it did crunch and then cartilage munched
The slimy invertebrate sloppily lunched,
It's tubular mass through the sewers did squirm,
A limb-ripping, flesh-tearing, many-toothed worm
With palpitating skin in gelatinous mounds,
It made it's way through Creepsylvania's grounds
Seeking the filth by which it was sustained,
The Swamp Hag had this maggot very well trained
Finding a coffin that was plentifully plugged,
The corpse was devoured by the glistening slug,
Rot and decay it ingested with zeal,
As long as it knew that it had a next meal

Feasting on the bloated dead
Stiffs enveloped foot to head
Vomiting acid into the crypts
To gorge on all the parts that dripped
Tomb after tomb it slowly creeped
As we watched our food sources deplete
It tunneled into our practice space
And listened as we moshed the place

Into the sewer it escaped
It's casing held a human shape
A squalling lump all set to burst
This town has not yet seen the worst(Instrumental)(Eklundh)

I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity 

I'm a pill, I'm a powder
I'm a needle in your vain
I flush your shitty life down the drain 

I am God in your asshole
I'm gonna save the nation
I am chemical salvation

I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity 

I'm a trigger happy finger
I am the stain of your brain
And I spit your pathetic life down the drain 

I am a slit throat
I am a stab in your gut
And I don't discriminate who I cut

I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity

It sure amazes me
The dumbness of humanity
I take one good, mad piss
At the walls of insanity 

Call me fear, call me hatred
Call me intolerance
Call me monsieur ignorance 

Call me what the hell you will
'Cos I am here to stay
As long as your head is full of clay

I bang my head against
The walls of stupidity
I bang my head against
The walls of stupidityI'm the new I stand in line
Blind Control for all these eyes

We touch the silence down the underground
Defies the distance wasted in your head

Believe me again , the meaning is

Run away forever from all the liars
I can take your desires, I'm the power of pain
I'm giving the answer again, the vision of my future is done
I'm losing the fear that I've got
The only word I know is the world I cling to

Paint the sky of your desires
Every night I'm still with me

Sometimes I wonder just where I am
No time to look back 
'cause we're goneAmong the hills a winding way
I am going to meet my education
be it a patch of my gaps
from happiness already turns red the face !
The way of knowledge is full of thorns
how to separate grain from chaff ?
A castle tower welcomes me from far
with its copper battlement.
Already a good piece of walk behind me
behold, a wooden Gasthaus there,
and the inscription says "ZUM SPIRITUS"
- its very name so nicely sounds !
My luggage here being so heavy
and full of books,
please, take them up
I want to sleep in the attic...
And do quickly serve the table
I ate in Prague for the last time
and some sort of Spirits too,
which would raise the humour !
Who is taking seat beside me ?
Greeting me by my name ?
Maybe a hundred years old woman
- that makes me feeling shocked !
And suddenly I see cards spread out
on a little table here
in a room filled with smoke
of pure hemp !
My supreme consternation
about her knowing my past
however, I want to know perfectly
what will give the future to me ?

[the fortune-teller:]
"Here the king and next the knave."
[Atrament:]
"What does it mean ?"
"A high born gentleman will lick your back."
"And what comes next ?"
"Ha, ha, if you order brandy, we hear in no time
whether you shall have your head on the log,
or a good fortune on your knees !"

Old hag, I am fed up with your talks,
I am an occultist !
Thought not seeing through the cards,
but I know how to do with life:
And in the bar a vermilion notice:
ET ZUM SPIRITUS TUO
I shall prefer to sing a duet
with my own tumbler !
As a flash from the clean sky
struck by the phantom of
a beautiful gril
in my eyes there sticks
the glance of her eyes
and those clear forms of her hips
We spent in waking all the night
and the bed empty in the morning
when the little Table bestowed
at the exorcising right enough !(Instrumental)The man closing up
Tries the doors.

But first
He closes the windows.

And before that even
He had looked out the windows.

There was no storm coming
That he could see.

There was no one out walking
At that hour.

Still,
He closes the windows
And tries the doors.

He knows about storms
And about people

And about hours
Like that one."Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer"

Since dawn of time
The fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites
And moving without eyes
A day of reckoning
When penence is to burn
Count down together now
And say the words that you will learn

Hell Satan - Archangelo
Hell Satan - Welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan - Archangelo
Hell Satan - Welcome Year Zero

"Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer"

Crestfallen kings and queens
Comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them
Is the presence of the wraith
Since fate of man is equal
To the fate of lice
As new dawn rises
You shalt recognize
Now behold the Lord of Flies

Hell Satan - Archangelo
Hell Satan - Welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan - Archangelo
Hell Satan - Welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan

He will tremble the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son
The ancient serpent deceiver
To masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of god

Hell Satan - Archangelo
Hell Satan - Welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan - Archangelo
Hell Satan - Welcome Year ZeroWe draw the curtains close
Night comes nigh
We carry two dots at head
so shine! shine! shine!

Flare along wagons 
Let's rush through the bushes
No gods from heaven!

We don't even stride
We simply bounce!

No roamer dares draw near
all they fear is light! light! light!
We taught the dusts weep
No sorrow we shall hide hide hide
cause we carry two dots at head

The extract from sour weed
we put them in sour weeds
it will shine, shine, shine!

I don't even stride
I simply bounce!!

you fly you fly you fly fly fly
I don't even stride
I simply bounce!!

I'm quicker than you

I don't even stride
I simply bounce!!

Can you see this world?
The justice doesn't exist
The planet is sick 
Everywhere is blood
and the stench of putrefaction
Gods power must to intervene

Cruelty of people without souls
The mask on their faces
and arms in their hands
The monsters chuckling
and innocence dying

The violence begets violence
the human race begets death

The bloody sick planet
The evil is so sick

Vain murders and sacrifices
Crazy wars and devastation
Liars Killers Politicians

Immolating their innocence

Filling the highway,
I saw the red innards for the ground"

Ravens fly, obliterate the sun 
"It's a sign of the devil. 
He will come for his servant tonight" 
These are dark times 
Suspicious minds breed like rats 
Guardians of corrupt morality 
Spread their filthy lies 

Am I to burn 
I have not sinned! 
Burnt at the stake. 
Innocent blood that can never be washed clean 

The flames of ignorance 
Grow higher and higher 
Licking my flesh - burning my soul 
The raven laughing in the moon 

These are dark times 
Suspicious minds breed like rats. 
Guardians of corrupt morality 
Spread their filthy lies again... 

[1st Lead - Michael | 2nd Lead - Christopher]Insane... Insane... Kim Jon II

A population is starving
Families run away to escape death
Men, women, children...
If they fail, they're burnt at the stake
A relative is forced to light the fire...

...and to watch the suffering
Labour camps detain 200000 people
Prisonners are fed on mud, tortured
Women who give birth see their babies
Immediately strangled

Hunger drives some people insane
Parents kill and eat their children
Some of them sell human flesh
How is it possible ?
Kim Jon II is willing to let die
Seventy percent of the North Corea populationDamn the child, Damn the spawn, The only life I've ever known 
Cut to size And critisized, Convincing me I am alone 
Chew me up and spit me out, It's a bitter world under my skin 
Turn the crank, Wind me up, Watch me go, it never ends 
Over and Over, Will it ever end 
I'll take my right, I'll stand and fight, No prisoners, no compromise 
Can't take me down, without a doubt, a raging beast that never dies 
Retaliate and feel my hate, The fury is a part of me 
If you attack I will bite back, If that's the way it has to be 
Over and over Will it ever end(Lyrics adapted from the text by Georg Trakl)

These mountains; blackness, silence and snow.
The red hunter climbs down from the forest;
Oh the mossy gaze of the wild thing.
The peace of the mother: under black firs
The sleeping hands open by themselves
When the cold moon seems ready to fall.
The birth of man. Each night
Blue water washes over the rockbase of the cliff;
The fallen angel stares at his reflection with sighs,
Something pale wakes up in a suffocating room.
The eyes
Of the stony old woman shine, two moons.
The cry of the woman in labor. The night troubles
The boy's sleep with black wings,
With snow, which falls with ease out of the purple clouds.Godly light, fills the darkened
Sky, oh my divine

Circuitry of extraction 
Trapped in cancer 
Obsessed illusion 

Rapacity of carnage exceeds tolerance 
Thoughtless abuse practiced rape 
Supervised extraction suits voracious interests 
That sap the blood from the Earth's heart 

The spine of a prolonged delusion 
We are controlled by unseen terror(Instrumental)The psychedelic round of energy rips through the body of the screaming ghoul, rending its thin flesh and removing a large section of its crooked and winding spine.  The monster howls further, levels reaching deep into the red and clipping.  Blood surges from its wound. A gentle hum: negative space.Lammashta - the sword that splits the flesh
Ishtar - concelebration of sin and wrath

I was awakened by the howl of a dog
I could not move or speak for the fear
That seized upon my spine
And wrapped cold fingers around my skull

Maskim Xul - the sight of whom causeth dismay
Rabishu - unholy mystery drove me insane

I have experienced the birth of untruth
Oh, pray for protection against the outside
I have deciphered the unholy texts
I have possessed the three seals of Masshu

I witnessed the horror that struck
Of which words cannot speak
And of which writing can only confuse
I found the fear of the deceased

And you are the slave of an external extinction

The zones of the Gods and the places of the Azonei
I reached through the gate of Ganzir, gate of lost
Death of a most uncommon nature I have seen
In the time of the war between the worlds

I was awakened by the howl of a dog
I could not move or speak for the fear
That seized upon my spine
And wrapped cold fingers around my skullYou say that I am nothing
With force you say that you will crush me
I await our battle
When that day comes I will be looking
For you to kill

When the war comes crowned king I will be
When the war comes I will slaughter the enemy
When the war comes on the field you can't hide
When the war comes you will die

You will bleed as I dominate
I will drain you from all your blood
If your words were just to scare me
Then you are wrong they made me smell blood
I will rip you apart

When the war comes crowned king I will be
When the war comes I will slaughter the enemy
When the war comes on the field you can't hide
When the war comes you will die

Eye to eye we stand a close combat we will have
You cannot win your defence I walk right through
My attack did hurt you bad fighting for a final gasp
Dead on the ground and I am marching on

You say that I am nothing
With force you say that you will crush me
I await our battle
When that day comes I will be looking
For you to kill

When the war comes crowned king I will be
When the war comes I will slaughter the enemy
When the war comes on the field you can't hide
When the war comes you will dieohhhhh

Yeah!
Yeah!
We are the Priests,
We are the Priests,
We are the Priests of the damned!!
(Billy says some things we couldn't understand here)
We are the Priests of the damned!!This country is a profit power
Politics is criminal and corrupt
Being a public man is a way to get rich
Religion is a kind of gain

They deceive these people
There's no good instruction for all

Companies fuck us all
With their greediness they destroy our forests
They'll take away the air that we breath
They'll kill us by starvation with their vast exploitation

In this land we don't, we survive
Health and wealth are privileges of the few

The luxurious and rich buildings
In contrast to inhuman dwelling places

It's a big profit institution
It's our country, green and yellowHere comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
It's all rightThe armed horde
In shield bright
March through world
Bringing death and fear
At fortress
Standing now
Of great battle
Long time came about
Mercy blown by wind
Orders given

Crack of bones
Bodies torn apart
Grimness wind

Time to bring
Freedom taste to dreams
Time of revenge

Blown with echo of big words
Wars for peace of our dreams
Burning stakes in name of truths

The blood spills
Still
Spilled on the altar of life
Our days dusky altar
Human habit stone fortress
In name of truhs
Way of virue
Way of truths
There is no time for mercy
What matter's facts
So let's spill with blood
Our office term
Darkness devours
World of endless time
Our world
Bloody rituals
Sign of the time
Ritual of death
Killing scream
Of burning souls
Of stone hearts

That no one knows
Holy war time
For domination
No one can destroy
Greedy senses
Name of savation
Sword raised above
The name of peace
Here is bloodshedIllusory Reality:

Slashing hands
With my blade
No protection from my hate

Eyes cut
Leaving void
Dangling by your mouth

Come to me Willing no fear or precaution

Victims hung on display
For my later reference

Devouring intestinal macabre
Choking on the stench

Starvation of vermin
Soon it will feast

Limbs torn from sockets
Faces ripped away

Rotted flesh my ambrosia

Tokens saved for lack of discrimination
Toys in my hand items of pride
Carcass stored for wretched flesh consumption
Flayed systematically by my saw
Shattered chest cavity
Intestinal coelom empties
At my feet your life lies

Preying on the helpless
Lethal verge of frenzy
Hands soaked with blood

Uncaught

UncaughtAlone in his castle the Ghoul Hunter toils,
Devising a plan to destroy
Feverishly working on a monstrous creation
A man of mechanix to cause devastation
Gears are adjusted for inhuman power
Ten feet tall; a wrought iron tower
Death he can bring with a squeeze of his claw,
Electrified net, or retractable saw

-Killbot is online-All systems go
-Tell me my orders but tell me them slow
"Go to the graveyard and flush out the Ghouls"
"Plunder the catacombs! Murder the fools!"

We saw him coming, he couldn't be missed
We tried to act brave but our pants were all pissed
He destroyed everything with no delay
Smashed every villager stuck in his way

(round)
Glowing laser eyes
Controlled by Gammalite

Crushing through tunnels and smashing through walls
Programmed for vengeance with deadly protocols
Iron ignoramous, mechanical sap
We four got together and set him a trap

We lured him right into a cage
And hacked away at his wiring with an axe
"Return to Castle" flashed in digital
As he lurched forward on a counter-attack

He shambled and twitched to the Ghoul Hunter's lair
And stomped through the drawbridge as if it weren't there

He flailed in a rampage, everything was pulverized
The castle walls began to crumble; he was trapped inside
Curses from the Ghoul Hunter were echoing within
As brick and mortar covered his ungodly creation(Instrumental)The day is changing to dark 
and my suicidal thoughts too

I'm fading away tonight
my temptation again rules

Your love to me dies slowly down
like also my patience soon

Don't worry about the troubles
I promised we stay together

And dissention problems or misery
Never can break our love
Our magic hond eternal attraction
No evil will overcome

The time was passing the time
like your old promises

Unfortunately I'm female
and my brain's under skirt

Watch my wrinkled face and grey fair
you destroyed my body and soul

That's just game with your good friends
also they like still you

The false and infidelity
The demoralized humanity
Suffering and waste time
Our love will be continue till the end of lifeGateways open to a monstrous cataract
Explore drifting conjectural lands of ill
Abodes of horrible implications 
No great thought may follow there
Atop seven golden stairs of old cold Kadath

Nyarlathotep

Massing the telepathic sending's of the immemorial master
Utter contradiction of all matter, force & cosmic order
Omniscient aeon devised through design...
Complete destruction
Of all sanity & order

Summon the machine, omnipotent crawling chaos 
Open our minds to the void
Carry forth our desire
That we partake in dreams of madness sake
Reveal the non Euclidean blind nuclear 

The outer dark, the forgotten, the whole obscene
Transcendent, cosmivorousFast exoscience
Hyper defiance
DNA blocked
tidally locked

liquid formations
chemical constellations
neverending
but not existing

[repeat]Hardened soul
Frozen for ages
Deep in the void
Of darkened hate
Loveless creature
In well trained flesh
Still hungry in need
For her warmth and shape
Search for the slave
The disciple of desire
Order replacing love
Order becomes loveIt seems someone's insane,
We all go a little mad sometimes,
Does a part of me really enjoy this?,
In fact, why did I ask myself that?,

Encased here in this tomb,
Maybe you were right about me,
It's true, lunacy does dominate,
In fact, maybe that's not even true,

(chorus)
So close,
With dirt on my hands,
Now an old soul,
War ravaged, but fresh,

Getting ready to go into reality,
Slowly I'm knowing what that is,
Covering up my slivered wrists,
I'm ready.....TO EXPLODE!!!

(and slip back into dementia...)He has no hunger for anything,
The man closing up.

He would even try stones,
If they were offered.

But he has no hunger
For stones.The boundary beyond which events cannot affect 
an outside observer.The point of no return. 
Photon spheres. Led to sector 9. 
Mental congestion of spacetime. 
Illusions becoming deadly.The gateway. 
The image becoming more and more redshifted as time elapses.
The most destructive force in the universe in controlled creation, to accomplish the human greed.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The beasts arrive in waves.  All are slain, infolaser rounds exiting their bodies from obscenely large wounds before extinguishing.  Newer arrivals slip in the omnipresent crimson.  Primitive weapons clash against one another as they fall to the ground.  Wails of understanding.  The mass of corpses threatens to pierce the ugly sky.We see hatred
You need the hold
You need the power
You need the fight
To overcome your fears
No once fights for you
All the way to the top
With the sweat power and will
My eyes will be burning

When you loose everything
You see the way in your eyes
You get to the struggle
You stand tall
Open your eyes and trust yourself
That's the way in your eyes
That's the path
To your fame

The haters in your way
They're angry, they never
Stand by you
My eyes will be burning

When you loose everythng
You see the way in your eyes
You get to the struggle
You stand tall
Open your eyes and trust yourself
That's the way in your eyes
That's the path
To your fame3. Lead Us To Darkness

Die...As spirits call from the other side 
All my Life
I've been waiting for you...I'm still waiting...
To take me

As the Shadows Speak...

My...Ghouls call you to the darker side
All my Life
I've been watching you...I'm still watching...
You're killing me

Where the shadows speak...

Can you see me from your cave?
Can you lead me as your slave?

Take my soul...Now when I am dead 
Take my heart...Now when I am cold 
Can't you see...?
My heart...Has always been yours
And my mind...Has always been on you

Oh Angel...Of Darkness 
Carry me with you 
And lead us to darkness

Can I be with you??? 
Can I feel you??? 
Oh lady of Black nights
Embrace me under your sight
Take me to your side
Far away from daylight

Take me your way
And Lead me to darkness
Show me your ways
And Lead me to darkness.Behind the lavish mirror
Where a clean commonage abides
The throne of accord has fallen
Sprung ablaze in the blackened sky
Divergence casts a dismal shadow
The luminous inscribed
The night's horde has crossed
Their pathetic line
Behold the lush infernal night
Remnants of woe in its wake
The spirited few who perceive the sight
Revel in the loss of the sane
A storm exists in swimming minds
Like a wolf apace in the dark
The voice of conquer echoes aloud
The spryest sparks are barred
Prune the bleeding flower
Its nectar pierce thy soul
Its burn-a torch most deadly
The paling light grows cold
Pry the seal of all life
Mere ill-flavored debris
An execrable earth
A wretched eternity
Brave the wind...leaves of time...lies
Strike down the common void
Hate...the stench of writhe...swine
Shy away from the light
A foul taste...the bitter sting...lash out
The lustrous slave must die
A whore's child...stillborn...life's vein
Bask in its bloodThe betray
Torn affinity
Lash out
Extrude
Grasp the mournful gloom
Remove
Pure dissension and pride
Replace
Commence our time anew
Abhor
Discard
Refuse
Allegiance to their fault
Instill
Contrive
Redeem
The pride that they have thieved
Abet
Uproot
Ravage
The kingdom they have formed
Crush
Route
Our flame
Will melt their golden crown
The way of the flesh is set
A presculptured dirt is dead
Unleash our wrathful riteA surface without life
All is fucked up
I see the demons here
they destroy everything

I am the ruler here
they are my slaves
Havoc is the rule
we only know the death

We hated them all
the artless mankind
that's why we destroy
Our vision is here...

Planet of death and fuck

You were at the place
where life ruled
but now you are there
where death rules

At my side
here you are
Forget the past
we are the futureYou have the power
You wear the crown
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

You wield the scepter
You wear the gown
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

In your empire
They stare in frown
From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown

Cruciger globus
You stand your ground
The orb disfiigured
What is flat looks round

From the pinnacle to the pit
It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crownSeeking light through darkness
Bleeding time
Seeking time through darkness
Bleeding light into the night

Media and politicians lie everyday
While we throw our freedom away
Horror war and slavery
Humanity must be set free

Open your third eye
Only then shall you cease to be blind

Materialization of my third eye
Illuminating the darkness
I come to the realization my kind might die
As I peer into infinite darkness

Light up the sky
Watch them die

Send in the drones
Destroy all the homes
Leave nothing left of their children but bones

Making a killing in the business of war
Soldiers know not what they are fighting for

Wars and genocide as of yet untold
What will our future hold as it all unfolds?

Enslavement is easy when you are king
The ignorant masses don't know a fucking thing

The time has come to eliminate the scum
The time has finally come

TERMINATE(Instrumental)It's night !!! Now lift up more the voice of my wicked soul
It's night !!! Awake up all lunar songs... to where goes the tears of my eyes and feathress? Walking in the olds and poetic catacombs
It's night !!! Now lift up more the voice of my wicked soul
It's night !!! Awake up all lunar songs 

To where goes the tears of my eyes and the feathress of my hear?
Walking in the olds and poetic catacombs, with horse screams of wrath and to fell that run up the noise by long galleries
I went in search of black candle, where emanated an immaculated light
Oh, dark and pale twilight, perpetuate this moment for what the seldom blaze of the black candle never extinguish

Under Delight of the Black Candle

I'm the coffin replete of malicious and angelical visions of life. I'm the misery, I'm the necromantical hunger, I'm the desire of to desire, I'm the malign guest

Your magic is replete of spiritual force, that's donated for yours bewitcheds. Oh, necromantical candle, oh ancient candle, make the solitude been my eternal homeland

Zombie, now I am a zombie who see the moon like a symbol of my existence. Seemed me as motherly... waiting for yours faithfull sons

To where goes the chalice replete of blood and pure tears of the virgin?!? I go feeling the astral light that's sended by mystic chandelier in the room, where sleep a beautiful woman dressed with sadomaniac adornments and ready to be impaled

I love you disgrace !!!We're standing here by the abyss
And the world is in flames
Two starcrossed lovers reaching out
To the beast with many names

He is
He is the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is insurrection
He is spite
He is the force that made me be
He is
Nostro dispater
Nostr' alma mater
He is

We're hiding here inside a dream
And all our doubts are now destroyed
The guidance of the morning star
Will lead the way into the void

He is
He is the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is insurrection
He is spite
He is the force that made me be
He is
He is the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
The disobedience
That holds us together
He is
Nostro dispater
Nostr' alma mater
And we are falling
Over the precipiceVERSE 1
The spectacle of life takes place in your mind.
Never forget you won't get out ALIVE
Illusions and thoughts will lead you astray
Rise against their rule and cry out:

CHORUS
I'm not a slave
to your mistakes.
(I'm not a) slave
to what you want.

VERSE 2
Watch 'em suffer, and never comply.
Never forget you won't get out ALIVE
Remember the voice that spoke in the dark
Rise against their rule and cry out:

BRIDGE 1
I feel down (DOWN, DOWN)
I can't breathe (BREATHE, BREATHE)
Pay them back (BACK, BACK)
Make them bleed (BLEED, BLEED)

BRIDGE 2
For all my waking hours, I think of you.
Instead of getting over, I'm torn in two.
Goodbye blue skies, and welcome over darker dreams.
But it won't... Won't stop me.
Won't break me. Won't hold me here.

OUTRO
Meaningless words,
spread my universe.
Unreal sense of freedom I beget
as memories now turn into regrets,
I try to heal my heart
The last glimpse of life I photograph
The last glimpse of life I photograph
The last glimpse of life I photograph
The last glimpse of life...
I photographI am chained to my kind through hate,
The breath I take is gifted upon me by you.
You are all I wish to be

Unless you think better of them.
I am a slave to my ego
As I try to run myself out of spirit
By respiratory fornication.

Father can I not be your most beloved
Until you cast on me your wretched spells.
You think I will never be of virtue
that you ever were.

I shall rule your universe one day
I know if that would be the day,
You think I will be unforgiving
You will only see that I was something beyond

And I will not hide behind false modesty
Like your sister and your mother.
That suffered your own father.
Your soul is a slut, just like them.

In the midst of all trouble you caused me,
I know you aren't a murderer,
But I also know,
You are a torturer.

He who does not submit to the darkness he is made of,
Shall always beget his flesh until he does.

A true warrior of the sealer of time I become,
Through your atrocity.
Forever enslaved I am within the knowledge and feeling of the end.
Therefore I will never deny what evil resides within.

A disease my kind and me were thought to be,
It only makes sense that we were the cause of suffering.
Blighted by the fact that we were so many,
This world spat out the disease.

What evil resides within every human being?Follow in step into line after line 
In accordance with what's required 

Assigned mantelpiece, designated function 
Memory pulped into the assimilation spider web 
Assimilation spider web 

Mind seduction aftermath 
Your identity has been seduced 
And quickly quieted.death of soul 
evil perceptions 
world in black 
the circus of night 

life of woe 
feeling of fear 
heart extinction 
the call of death 

im suffering 
i am scared 
scapegoat 
of lucifer 
and of the grandeur 
of mighty hell 

black ideas 
suicidal flash 
murdering tendancies 
the call of maggots 

grave wish 
the bones out of the flesh 
marginalisation 
of the reasonI can't afford to live
I can't afford to die
And all that I can give
Is in this tear I cry

The second-hand shoes
The hand-me-down clothes
These old worn-out rags
Are what this body knows

I don't have a TV
And have no radio
Don't have a car to
Drive to where I go

Always on a diet
There's nothing to eat
There's no daily balance
Or requirements to meet

I haven't with what
To spend on anyone
I'm not one of those
To go out and have fun

I have lost the past
Probably, the future too
Don't turn out like me
Please, whatever you do(Instrumental)Merchants plot, oubliettes poise 
Dank ill begot, harrowing diffuse 

Sinking liths ferment 
Heedless bill of fare 
Murmur depth of field 

Silage digest ... drank of peril 
Till father terror firma 

Mephitic yield consummates 
Faction conseeds 

Adjourning mills ... ensueOnward! warriors! ride those waves
For honour gold and property
I won't rest with my wife
Because battle is in my blood
Winter storms roar, masts burst
We laugh in the face of the storm
To die in battle-the highest honour on earth

Lead my ship
Lead my ship

Odin, lead my ship to the kingdom of asgard
See wild valkyres riding
Odin, father lead me to the everlasting kingdom
I shed my blood in battle
Just like our forefathers

Raging giants, burning belief
The axes ooze with anger
The faithful viking belief
The warrior's most precious resource
Defying the wild thunderstorms
Thor's hammer lights the sky
The ravens whisper our victory
In the ears of the godly world

Winter storms roar, masts burst
We laugh in the face of the storm
To die in battle-the highest honour on earthI see you - the many
United you stand against me
Me the divine creator
You dare challenge my might
How can the flock
Challenge me, the shepherd? 
Risk all just to be rid of me
Thy lord, thy ruler

Lord of the condemned
Show the might of your minions
I challenge thee, oh lord divine
Die with gracious dignity

I see you- the lord
The tyrant that rules thy nobles
Unity of my thousands
Against your treacherous plots
How can your lowly few
Withstand our vast numbers
All shall battle for me
The leader, the master

Fiendish traitor
I shall dispatch
Your taunts weaken me not
You shall be crushed
In glorious combat
And I'll retake all that's mine

Oh feeble, lords and masters 
I heed not your rule
Alone I stand against all
In the greater knowledge 
Dear lords and masters
You know little of me
My knowledge grows vast of you
As does your ignorance of meTo born, to feel, to think what's going around
To grow, to learn, to know there's no answers
Flying over known places, finding out your odd senses

So what's next?
In the endless way to somewhere
Somewhere to understand the dancing stars

Too far from me I reach the lost memories
Behind the laughs I find my own way to hide
I wish I had nothing now so I would get what I want

White birds toning down this grayish day
Leading my thoughts to a safer place
Taking my sorrow, turning in into faith
Waiting for my blue dreams
I'm runing myself into ruins
Yearning the sunshine, that I've never seen

Looking for something that keeps me lookings
Lead me to nothing, so I keep messing around
With my fucking mind

All these wasted years in my life
Led me to unleash a hell to come
Drowing, bleeding signs that I can't see
Sightless windows

When I lay within myself again
Wait your never ending light to shine
Take my chaos and my fears away
Bring myself to breakYour world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love
You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missedLife, boundless, running it's course
Consciousness bestowing it's force
Experiences often delt in despair
Weariness, anguish felt, conflict unfair

Non-physical reality
Reality, perceptions differ immensely
Infinite horizons
Insight brings desillusions

Entering the absence of tangible matter
Oneself is free and aims higher
Reaching initiatory learning
Living trials, choosing paths, for inner suiting

To new heights, I can reach to the skies
Will not surrender to what is real
Among the dead, alive, is where I belong
The last dimension of non-physical reality

Rising enlightment is attained
Deceived, for it is such as strain
The realisation of space-time illusions
Hiding the true purpose of humansA lot hasn't happened 
Yet nothing remains the same 
Lidless, blameless 
The unblinking mirror of self-reflectionThe restorative spliff 
Truly hearing for the first time 
A "perfect" world suffers 
The insect-child laughs goodbye 
I see the sickness 
You're all on fire 
Fire, Forge a Messiah 
A rival 

Dope sick fear, sear, lust and listen 
Go to sleep and thrust nothing 
A grievance has risen 
I step up and give thanks 
Kneeling before no one 
No one before me 
The Godless north of belief(Instrumental)Each time when and then i try to muster up. digging in t
Box of thoughts to reunite flesh and mind. a light breeze of disarray driving me deep into misery
Holding the light that is still shining the threshold... like a dream within a dream, a vision within a
Vision. millions of thoughts they stream. emotional awakening by a deception. when i look into my own mind
Standing beside a broken window. shimmers of hope are steaming from the remains,
Reflected by opaque and broken glass. a light breeze of disarray to reunite flesh and mind. each
Time when and then, driving me deep into misery. doubting on my own fellow, the threshold of
Emotional suffering(Instrumental)DAY 1. SIRENS WAIL IN WEIRD, LOW FREQUENCIES, VIBRATING THE HAIRS ATTACHED TO SOMETHING WEAK AND DYING, UNAWARE OF ITS OWN RAGING SICKNESS. MIGHTY TEMPESTS ABROAD THE HORIZON GATHER TREACHEROUSLY IN STRENGTH, AND BENEATH THE CRUST, THE FIRES SCOLD THE EARTH'S FOUNDATION. SOME FEEL THE EARTH'S CORE SHIVER, AND THE STENCH OF WARM BLOOD; MOST, HOWEVER, FEEL SOME OTHER SHIT. BUT ALL IS SILENCE. THIS IS THE DAY THEIR LORD RESERVED FOR SACRED REST, WHICH IS BITTERLY SARCASTIC BECAUSE TODAY, NO ONE CARES ABOUT THEIR PRECIOUS LORD... "TODAY WE'RE ALL HAPPY AND TODAY WE LAUGH; TODAY, WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT OUR PRECIOUS LORD; TODAY THE LORD CAN NOT DO A SINGLE THING FOR US! SO WE BRING DISGRACE OVER OUR LORD'S WORD". THE FIRST DAY IS THE DAY OF SILENCE. 

DAY 2. A NAUSEOUS STORM WHIPS THE GLOBE INTO FURY AND MADNESS; MOLOTOV COCKTAILS THROWN IN ARROGANT FACES. HUMAN FEET TRAMPLE THE BODIES OF THE POLICE; THE SCENT OF FUCKED HUMAN MEAT AND WARM ASPHALT. THOUSANDS OF BLACK SCREENS REPORT FROM THE Show no mercy, Kicked me to the ground
Felt no pain, You're deaf to every soundSummoning the powers below
I release fires of my soul
My faith is tried and forged
I fear no death nor life
I have the key of knowledge
Locked deep in the sea of myths
Where I may drown or enlighten
As darkness calls my name
Possessed by demons of disease
My future is still in my hands
Avenger of hell my name
And rocky is my path
Cold and evil on demand
I have no mercy no regrets
Rage discharged in the face of my enemy
I know my legacy will last(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The influence of repulsion
A continuity of nothingness
Mind betrays body
Body betrays mind
See us from outside
Vast worms knotted by habit
Vast chains to hold us down
The failure of intimacy
The impossibility of power
The inexpressible loneliness of thinking
The beast obscured by black duskWe had no need for teeth or wits
We lost both while eating bananas
And wearing furry hats
Luxuries we solemnly rejected
In favour of hard pilgrim life
And public masturbation
We had no need for bathwater
Our aura repelled the undead
And perturbed the diplomat monkeys
Who jumped and whined
But had to applaud our stealingCome choir boy stay for a while
Let's practice the way of God
To enter the pearly gate
There is no certain way
And I am the key worship me

On your pretty knees
Open your little mouth
Look me in the eyes
Swallow your way to Christ

Do as you are told if you seek heaven
It feels like heaven

This is the way on every Sunday
You must see me again
The lord he works in mysterious ways
Just do as you are told
Then you'll be accepted at the gate

On your pretty knees
Open your little mouth
Look me in the eyes
Swallow your way to Christ

Do as you are told if you seek heaven
It feels like heaven(Instrumental)Forget the answers
That you believe on true
Look inside you 
Tell me what I do
To live without a reason
For Eternity

Please remember 
My only dream has gone
Now I can see
The way inside my heart
Beyond my indecisions
I don't want to change my place again
For Eternity

Fly to live without a reason
Forgetting my name 
Forgetting my name
Beyond my indecisions
Time is for you
Life is for you
Live for eternity

Remember forever
The only day I've cried
It's never an easy way
To showing my sense of how
Beyond my indecisions
I don't want to change my place again
For eternity(Cover of Sam Cooke's "Another Saturday Night")

I got in town a month ago
I seen a lot of girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em
But as yet I haven't met 'em
That's how I'm in the state I'm in

//chorus
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of bein' my deliv'rance
She had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

//chorus

Someone to talk to, someone to talk to
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I'm in an awful way

It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey
To help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

//chorus
//chorus

I'm in an awful way...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Knocked out right now
Heart is bleeding , it` s getting down
see the speed of light , bodies burning bright .
Crying out passion and pain ,
kicked in the teeth again and again
boned out down in pain , frozen Heart
crying in vain

Tonight the Hell , the Hell is rising .

Running for some Drugs , to cool me down
I see those Devils , gathering around .
Crying out Passion and Pain ,
kicked in the teeth again and again
boned out in Pain
frozen Heart crying in vain .

Tonight the Hell , the Hell is rising .
Sin after Sin .
Tonight the Hell , the Hell is rising .
Sin after Sin .
Tonight the Hell , the Hell is rising .

MY SIREN'S CALLING 
LEADING THEM TO A MERCILESS END AS THEY FAIL!Necrophagia,
Rabies, 
Hogwash...

Growing lust,
For flesh, 
Possess 
Your mind...

Thirst for
Blood,
Beyond imagination...Walkin' in a darkest streets
even lights was on my own
Following by a huge shadow
faceless for now
Walkin' a little faster
as my heart beat harder
I'm scared!
I just wanted to go back home
How can you do such things
Yes, you , fucker
Rape, just to sperm, on a girl you don't even love
A girl "which" doesn't wants you
You finally grap my shoulder
i'm feeling your power.
i think i can't escape
And bring me into a little dark and cold street
full of garbages, stinky, hell! i guess it's your home!
You got this knife pointed at me, and smile, oh fuck!
how stupid you look like!
Then you wanted to take away my skirt like a beast
Should i cry? Should i let myself being is thing?
Hell no, i'm the evil! I swear that you are going to DIE!
My finger creates on you two new holes, instead of your eyes
then you could receive more from
Two other bastards like you
Now you are blind
just like before, but sure now you can't see a shit
With your knife i cut off the things that you call brain,
Oh?Balls...
And i see you were screamin' like a shit
poor mother fucker!
I see you slowly die in your paradise
i won't call an ambulance
I'll let you die and feel the painThere is an indefinable mysterious power that pervades everything.
I feel it through I do not see it.
It is this unseen pwer which makes itself felt, and yet defies all proof.
It is so unlike all that I percieve through my senses:
It transcends the senses...

People do not know who rules or why and how he rules.
And yet they know that there is unseen power that certainly rules.
I feel it, though I do not see it.
It is so unlike all that I percieve through my senses:
It transcends the senses...

In the midst of death, life persists.
In the midst of untruth, truth persists.
In the midst of darkness, light persists.
Truth persists, light persists.
I feel it, though I do not see it.
It is so unlike all that I percieve through my senses:
It transcends the senses...

It transcends the senses.This is the story of three men who were destined to meet each other. Though they faced many hardships, they stayed best friends forever. But I'll let the song tell the rest.

The Rusty Trombone and The Dirty Sanchez
They are my best friends (my best friends)
I love Rusty's dogs, but they like Dirty
But Dirty hates dogs (he hates dogs)

Dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
He hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
He hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
He hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
Hates dogs
He hates dogs

Though Rusty's dogs did like Dirty, they did not fight, and they grew up to be the best of friends. And they were very hot. But I'll let the song tell the rest. 

We are the hottest, the hottest guys in the world
We have nice eyes (real nice eyes)
Dirty has nice eyes, and Rusty has a nice face
But I have nice thighs (real nice thighs)

Thighs
Nice thighs
Nice thighs
Nice thighs
I have nice thighs
Nice thighs
Nice thighs
Nice thighs
I have nice thighs
I do
Not lie
'Cause I
I have nice thighs
You wish
You had
Nice thighs
'Cause I have nice thighs

This song is pretty, but I am prettier
And you know it (you know it)
This is the end, of my song
Don't you love it (you love it)

The ode to us(Instrumental)Eroded epigastrium
ambrosia constipates my pylorus
my urge to excretion 
is prevented by my swollen anus

Gastric spastm torturin my body from within
anal ejection of vomit, excrements and urine

Oesophagus is stuffed with awful grub
constipation, estomach erupts
oozing chyme, disgorged and puked
delicious slime is garnished with clots

Pendulous abdomen
filled with faecal mess
unexcretedurine
urethra is now slashed

Opressive teesmus
distorted stomach bursts into muddy shreds
lavatory explodes
my body is embalmed in this sauce

Anal defecation of juces fumes and lumps
ultimated eruptions epigastric region explodes
your muddy torso remains in sewage
growned in this sauce as your torso is dissolved

Limb from limbs
as disgorgement begins
pus discharges from your mouth
and finally you stop to shout !!LONDON

Kill the weak hail the strong
That's Great Inferno London's song
Glowing cauldrons burning stoves
Rubbish people torture loves

Purge the poor greet the King
That's Great Inferno London's thing
The Grill is hot lay down to rest
Weaklings fail my subtle test

Great Inferno London kicks
Let's party like 1666
Great Inferno London kicks
We party like 1666

Eternal City Northern Line
I purge the filth herd the swine
Hang the robbers from my Tower
That's what they get for hating Power

House of Pain Church of Lust
Scream you will obey you must
Whip I will then pour the cum
I am London Lord of Scum

Human life divided ditch
Below the poor above the rich
Weak men die strong men run
One half in shit one half in sun

Life's lost Death's won
People die but party on
I am London King of Cum
Drink my sperm you filthy bum

Rack of spikes torture drum
I am London Lord of Scum
Spirit storms body heat
May you dig the shit you eat(Instrumental)A body collapses, a mind lies in trance,
A god takes control without remorse.
A body collapsed, a mind broken in trance,
Paranoia is the guiding force.

Something wicked is coming,
Deep inside it's dancing.

Shining Toxic.
A fever illusion, a rising sun.
Shining Toxic.
A mental pathway, the final run.

Bedevil the mental nave,
Spite the umbilical cord,
Tie a thousand knots,
Thus the coma gods can come.

A lithe sinking back into the wicked.

Obsessive visitor, rush through the heart.
Take the needle in, thus the coma gods can come.

A body collapses, a mind lies in trance,
A god takes control without remorse.
A body collapsed, a mind broken in trance,
Paranoia is the guiding force.

Shining Toxic.
A fever illusion, a rising sun.
Shining Toxic.
A mental pathway, the final run.

A riotous riddance in glistening pride.
Intervene divine, embrace the light.

A lithe sinking back into the wicked.
A lithe sinking back.(music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andera Buratto)

I can feel the heat... it's so sweet
from my head to my feet
I need another dose of nicotine

Your eyes can kill me, but your mouth could save me
Your scent it shakes my mind, tonight I'm going crazy
You know I can't take my eyes off you
A game called... "can look, can't touch"

//chorus
Follow me, follow me - please baby come with (me) somewhere
and commit a sin... and baby stop this nightmare
Follow me, follow me - forbidden fruit is bittersweet
I don't know why but now I want to eat

You're like a devil in gisuise, girl!

Deep inside
I'm paralyzed
You can see it in my eyes
I'm going down... I die
Every time you pass me by

The way movin', the way you dancin'
The way you're shaking all your body's meant to haunt me
You know I can't take my eyes off you
But my hands will... never be free

//chorus

I shouldn't take you baby because I'm sure
I'll be heading straight for hell... but... well.... uh!

Your eyes can kill me, but your mouth could save me
I'm going crazy

You know I can't take my eyes off you
A game called... "can look, can't touch"

//chorus

//chorus(Instrumental)3. War Of Shadows

Tell me why they cry
and show me why we die,
must be something
that doesn't have future in
this world of
war, pain, hate, between men
and iron waepons
fighting for a natural cause

[Bridge]
Living forever this,
paying the price of this war,
trying to live this
bloody field.

Around your
conquest dreams,
destruction you can see,
only for winning a war
that doesn't make any sense for me
laws why, if our minds are in chaos,
first think how
could you change your thoughts

[Bridge]
Always living under
someone's domination,
prayinf for surviving
and waiting

[Chorus:]
Waiting for this dark and destruction times,
trying to understand the meaning of this war.
Waiting for something that someda will be,
like a war of shadows
That doesn't make any sense for me.Blissful Betrayal 
By Itay Necrofog Krasilshikov

Longing for the pallid touch
Sacred death of body
United under raven (and) sun
Blissful terror rising

Decades long our paths did part
And never joined again
This darkness cloaks a wretched soul
Take heed of nightless flame

Writings carved with iron heart
Forever standing tall
The rain that spills upon its core
Runs bloody red of toil

Decades long our paths did part
And never joined again
This darkness cloaks a wretched soul
Take heed of nightless flame

I kneel, upon flames I dwell
Awoken into tortured body
Servant of nightly wishes
Malicious, demonic flesh fiend

Betrayal by ghastly apparition
Vision clear for all to see
I, blinded by winged shadows
Cannot bare beastly desolation

The lamenting anguished mind
Same one bound forever by steel
Intoxicated by blasphemous glory
A beauty that exceeds all fleshly conception

Onwards must thunders blight my lamentation?
Hateful, I clench at my desperation
Seeking forever lifeless agonized minds
Thus impaired my life will ever be

Turn to disbelief
Self afflicted pain
Uncontrollable hate
Sacrifice by will

Revelation
Abhorrence
Sorrow
Death(Instrumental)I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe

It's the same old song
That I always sing each year
But because it's perennial
Don't make it less real

And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe

I believe you could be
(I believe)
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(Oh, it just keeps coming 'round again)

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)

The conclusion I need
Is easily reached with you
You have given me all
And there's nothing left to do

And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe
I believe
It just keeps coming 'round again

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believeSelf punishment of the unpure whore
Beaten by the wings of an angel
Blessed by the no good bastard
Raped by the horde of demons

Lust bursting on every whiplash
The deepest cut delivers the shivers

No prayers left for the sinner
Second gate opened with power
Sister impaled from behind
By the horn, hard almighty

Sold, bought, and sold again
Cheap, used and bound to hell

... There is no such thing as innocence
The flame burns us from belowTonight we settle scores. 

From the first veil of snow to the last breath of winter, treading forth in the shivering wastes, 
Will this long journey ever end? 
Forty years wandering, cold, lost, and weary, with little strength to carry on, 
Under the weight of this burden... 
The crushing weight of all my years. 

Chorus: 

From the forests to the skies, across the ocean's dismal tide, through the boundless wake of frozen glacier's rage... 
For the last time I will ride forth, and once more I shall abideth, to return a debt; my honor satisfied. 

From the dawning of Spring to the twilight of Autumn, and all throughout the Summer's flame, 
Restless and worn with season's change. 
And I don't know how much longer I will go on, 
Will I take this to my grave? 
O, Gods, release me from my fate! 
And yet I fear it's far too late... 

Chorus 

Bridge: 

At last, I can breathe but for a day. 
In dreams, forever night, when will I stay? 

At last, I can breathe.Music and Lyrics for Sepulcher Beneath The Moon and Angel of Rome by : Mijail 
"Ages ago, In a celestial kingdom was an angel favored by god..."from the shores of the cosmic ocean 
is transparent the syndication between all things 
an unending chain connecting everything 
from particles to galaxy clusters 
Despondesy is unjust in a universe thats in a continuous saturnalia 
Orgasnic explosion spew out cosmic sperm 
An eternal and ardent dance between celestial beings 
Conviviality of Licentiousness runs through the cosmic arteries 
From a macroscopic point of view is obvious that Nature is Satans church 
Intoxicated we wader through the universe in our heads 
the new age contamination sets us to a slow and painfull slip into the nothingness of death 
I feel the world and me are in deferent sides of an event horizzon 
Mirth comes from ken 
Nature is Satans church 
The traveller of many worlds wonder how we could let beuty and life to be controlled 
the creatures cognition of the symptom of the universe 
further they go into the shrine of promiscuity 
fear destorts reality and into o system of dread only outlaws can percieve the true nature of the cosmos 
Mirth comes from ken 
Nature is satans church 
dazed he is at the sight of unearthly beuty 
he feels pain hitting the bars in his oun minds prison 
he fears the sensual eyes of freedom 
its painfull to withstand your apetite for life 

evil is anthing tha confines life 
eden is the temple of licentiousness

What the fuck is out there is equilibrium of despair?

A distortion of reality, war-torn reddened skies.
Values are shifting, to the left and to the right.
Is it paranoia, or is the end in sight?

Far away from heaven, what is this place I see before my eyes?
Far away from heaven, conspiracy's a great disguise.

The past keeps repeating, or so I heard today.
When black becomes white, it's time to turn away.
Truth is distorted, the lies within your mind.
It's time to open eyes, because the blind lead the blind (lead the blind) ....

Far away from heaven, what is this place I see before my eyes?
Far away from heaven, conspiracy's a great disguise.

Unmeasure in worth and unclean
Fire distinctive regions
Dire and hidden meanings
Revised giganormous in size
Mesmerized in its deceit and demise
Hostility's misleading kiss
Returned to me unnoticed
Distributed and fragmented
Pieced out demented
Burned and degraded
Worn-out and faded
Validated non directional
Spacial and specialit's a premature feeling, that the end is drawing nigh. Distraction from the truth that you're never'going to die.
Impending doom - not based in reality, but the darkness of your mind. A close shave with sanity (never going to die...)
Climbing the walls - there's no way out at all. A last action to take - Escape, escape, escape...
Paranoia has dug in deep, the last few days I've had no sleep. Seems like there's no hope to find - running through my mind...
Take a pill, think it through - the world goes on and so do you. There a world left to conquer, but its running through my mind...
Climbing the walls - there's no way out at all. A last action to take - Escape, escape, escape...Inside the nightmare institution,
For your sins, no absolution.
Better draw up a constitution,
And start to free your mind...

Truth is lies, and white is black,
Sometimes the way through's going back.
In reverse on the wrong track,
Their heaven is my hell...

Walls are built with bloodied hands,
History lies beneath the sands.
Don't give in to their demands,
They'll take it all away...

When you can't find a way,
Then perhaps it's time to pray.
But if god is your all,
The he won't return the call...My shadows thrown out over me,
ALone on my knees.
I'm going to beat my head several times
For I wanna destroy myself...
...But I know that I haven't the heart to do it.

I'm the frailest guy
Cutting blades are flying and scratch in my brain.
I open my eyes and I see the blood.
My wounds have no way to heal.

My hopes will have to wait
In order to know what shade life is...
...I hope I won't be as I've always thought about it.

I hope it keeps a tight hand on me,
I'd live walking thoughtless
But the tears dropped
Lie in the way, ready to drown me.

I look at theat wonderful landscape
Thinking of those voices I've got in my arid garden
And then I compare.

I know, I'll know everythong from that easy glance
I won't understand...

...Useless thoughts...Hate, is with that you feed me
Anger, that's a great stuff to spit
God, the thing that you love to pray
Satan, it's more your behavior
and both of them are story
and both of them ask you for money
I see you go to church and sing so pure and beautiful song
but i also see you drink like a crazy and beat your children
I also read and i see that in the name of god...
many wars started
And I also read that some holy man abuse kids, sexual abuse....
...and slavery
And all of this contradiction in speech of some politics
and the manipulation of statistics
Why do you need bloody pictures?Are you blind?
Fake and corrupted place, that's where we live
Paradise, might be great, but for now, it's just a dream
All of these people on the top of the pyramid control the world
organisms, are under control of one nation, is that fair?
They make money thanks to you and me
they make you believe, like when you are a child
you can see story, and believe,
but open your fucking eyes, that's a big shit
Take weapons, revolution!
I live in a democracy, but with what i study, i just realize that
kingdoms, empires, dictatorships and democracy can all be represent by
a pyramid, where you got on the top, the power, and down all of us, puppets
I see manipulation, information, propaganda, and brain washing all day long
I also read that some of our deputes go to tribunal for hungry money robbery
I also read how Hitler take the power of his country,
and i see September eleven...ik ben de dapperste der Gehurkten

We are more than meets the eyes tonight, you know I know my part
There are no sounds around us now... can you hear my heart?

Oh, now it burns like a star... I lose myself on your lips
and you light up my spark
Oh, it's only you and me... it's our party my dear...
we don't need nothing else

I've been waiting for this crazy night to come

//chorus
Raise your drinkin' glass - take me higher
take a shot and take me to the stars
Raise your drinkin' glass - give me fire

Hold me and touch me my dear... let our senses free
the world around disapears
Oh, from a dark hotel room to the heaven above
Here we are, We are one

I've been waiting for this crazy night to come

My little sin
Now drink a toast to me
It's a pleasant fight without any wounds
You turn me up and down
I'm spinning round and round
Can youfdeel my pleasure? Yeah, yeah, yeah!

//bridge

When your lips are on me baby, I lose my senses
you are my angel so please come with me
Baby when your fingers touch me and your glances
caress my soul, please don't let me be free - don't let me be free!

//chorusCalm air dances on my golden skin
Black mountains smiling at me
Elitist solitude fills my lungs
As I dive into the valley
The faint sound of the crackling skulls
My road of disease and famine

This land, this sky, my creation

Wilted fruits and crippled souls
I leave them to fly again
I rise higher eclipsing the sun
And shining brighter than him

This land, this sky, my creation

You, my reflections in these islands
I glow through you in victory
Unholy winds of great torment
Around me, around me
I am the star which shines in the sky
Which burns its mark on youInvisible... the worm that is hiding in my entrails
as the shadows are shining at the bottom of hell  
 
A journey without end
A funeral pall, with a discordant siren
 
My damned nature, the origin of worms
A navigation without destination
A funeral pall
 
Psychonautic Odyssey
 
Inside to my shipyard,
a motion of cold
an Ion atmosphere... philosophy
with the words of nothing
 
A trap of sickness 
and despair
 
Psychonautic Odyssey
 
The salvation of never
a savior in the ocean of pain
the underground...
a voyage that will become the last
 
Ice, a quest of wisdom
shades commands the thoughts of return
 
Mind spheres with broken mastheads
dressed in colors of apocalypse
guiding with futility
hallucinations of organic disharmony
 
Extravagance - another dimension of wrath
The road of inner confession
the instincts of godsCursed creature,
There's only one place for you
That is the paradise of evil
Heap of what stayed

Your bones asking to the vermin
Will suffer what the world's been through
Cursed creature
Your bones asking to the vermin

Your place is there
In that cold grave
Where the hurricane blows
This is the voice of curse

Your bones asking to the vermin
Will suffer what the world's been through
Cursed creature
Your bones asking to the vermin

Your punishment will be suffering
Searching for the eternal sleep
Worms on your body
Beings from hell

Extending the bugs
That come from deep in the ground
Searching for
The death, still in flesh to devour

To te world
Their existence will be the end
Let your creature, morbid and cruel

Vanish in the solitude of nothing
Vanish in the solitude of nothingCheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine

[Pre]
When I'm hiding, when I need it,
it lets me breathe,
for our handle on this life, I don't believe
this time

[Chorus]
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again.....

Forever fooling, free and using,sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled?
It's a damn shame, but who's to blame?

[Pre]
[Chorus]Into the forest of Moloch
Copious dark secrets within
The eyes of the owl are now upon us
Piercing through all who serve him
And as as darkness fall at it's feet
A congregation of the occult gather in robes
To burn an effigy

The flames of the pyre rise higher
Billowing above the trees
Burning 'dull care'
Fully aware of their disease

Blackened majestic forest
Tinged with the blackest intent
Of the darkest forces
Scorn of lament

The flames of the pyre still rising
'Dull care' is burning away
A sacrifice unto the owl
Beneath it's dark gazeThe Earth was peaceful with generous climate
and man has just learned to sow and earn the land...

several civilizations came to life
until the Earth was hit by a large and enclosed disaster
it began to lightning at the bright firmament

signs of an adversity chimed the end when heaven darkened
a terrible rain colluded the Earth, rain red like blood half as hard as stone
fires came out of the sky, no one could escape this world slaughter

man and beast were swallowed forests crushed
the world's continents sucked into the seas
the throne Earth oscillate and overturned
hurricanes swept the continents of our planet

raging waters.... after many days of darkness.....
the survivors came out.... began to raise their lives again

the deluge legend about the fall of humanity
is the only remain of similar time
probably the earth has been thrown back in
an indisputable caprice of nature

have we start the laborious path of evolution
upwards to the ages again, again, again.....

is it true that similar events ever taken place
can we prove the evidence in the traditions of almost every race

traditions by countless generations
they all speak about times of total destruction
today man is at the edge of an equal disaster
we simply let it happen although it's closed as we expect

we're strangers upon.... our world is dying....
men locked itself up.... he looks through the cracks of his cave....Inconceivable evil,
Seeped down from the stars
He is sunken,
Drowned dead and deep
City of antiquity,
Darkly curtained halls
Wealth of Aeons behind them

Magical and obscure
Preparation science

Shall proceed from
The Ocean depths

And with the Aeon-old
Stench of the Sea...
Astound a reeling universe,
Man reduced to mere cattle,
Before the Earth
Is cleared off(Original Score by Angelo Badalamenti)

I can't give you all my dreams
Nor the life I live
You and I won't friendship miss
That's all we got to give
Who will take your dreams away
Takes your soul another day
What can never be lost is gone
It's stolen in a way
Please, don't stand too close to me
Can you hear my heart
Take my woe and lean on me
When we're not apart
Now our mission is complete
And our friends are hid
Evil things brought down by the light
Life goes on until the endLies consuming
 Ideals falling
 Wrath inside growing
 The puzzle is scrambling

 Blinfolding
 Hate becomes consuming
 Me versus the world
 Composition is interesting

 Ohh ultimate destruction
 Last war
 For chocolate bar they are fighting
 Wrong leader is leading

 Chorus
 You are my ride away
 Personal angel of death
 Please format c
 End misery

 Listen emperor talking
 Flood gates opening
 And after a second
 Damage is done

 Chorus
 You are my ride away
 Personal angel of death
 Please format c
 End misery

 Desire for destruction
 Pleasure from chaos
 Lust for armageddon
 MeAs the sky burns my eyes will turn blind
My tears melt as my soul reached his end
What I've ever felt has thrown into the dark
My heart has drained by the loss of my love

Silence speaks in ways where words will end
Whispering my faith that I don't understand
What is this path that was chosen for me
Walking in fear, left alone

The game has begun but I know how it ends
Torn by the hands of madness
Why is this light fading to me
This emptiness is killing me

Death comfort me , while I sleep forever
Touched by your flame, as it burns my eyes
Invoked by your spell, as it binds my heart
Enchanted by your flesh, as it has been tornA shattering hand is hard to cleave
A shit cocktail shaked by the beast
My stomach hurts, it slides outside
My organs I don't care

I swim in a lake of shit...
Soon... A mess in my own vomit
Beautiful spasm tonight
Feels like boiling oil inside

In the morning I wake up in pain
My stomach hurts again
The daily toilet torturing's so bloody I am in pain
Feel so bad

I vomit so much on my shoes
Strange... the voice in my head can't be used
A feeling inside of me
Let's do the final slideDunkaroos!

Where are you?They've tried to convert me to this faith
but I have chosen isolation
I sacrifice my blood and suffering to God
and to my black soul anxiety

Rape me
Rape my soul

Tell me how to survive another night
Fear means nothing to me, but still!
If I could mark you with desire
You will remain lonely in your own world

Let us talk about the only truth
A few words which will change your life
Your calm existence will guarantee death
Tension and fear will bring salvation

I am the only creator of beauty
You will ask what's the creator's name
Call out to me
For a moment I will not tell you to wait
You're hungry for knowledge
Love me

Where you die every day
I open the gates of endless dreams
I am only an unfulfilled dream
I am only a part of the whole
Where I kill every day
I open gates to a new world
I am the omnipotent master there
My name's "liar"That's your time came today
That time came today for you
The wall crashed
Bricks that are stained with blood
Ground into dust
Blown by winds of oblivion, time of freedom
Reality over the dreams
The nation crazy of joy
Justice, never existed never will
The words only
Are worth nothing
Raise your heads you proud and stupid
Now unleashed from chains of coma
Your houses are turned into graves
Your children are dying of hunger
That is the price of your freedom
Ground fed with blood
Is still hungry
For heads screaming in pain
Insatiale
For into dust
Thousands of years(Instrumental)Did you ever stop to think about how
Every silver lining has its cloud?
If a sick little monkey were to give you three wishes
Are you sure you'd know the difference?

Between what you gave and what you'd get
What is real and what's not?
What to hide and what to flaunt?
What you need and what you want?

Cuz when the monkey demands his sacrifice
You better be ready to pay the price
You better know what you're asking for
When you ask the monkey's paw
Is it what you need or what you want?
Beware the monkey's paw

Cuz if you realize that you didn't really need it
Got a monkey on your back?
You'll have to feed it
There's no escape from the Monkey's law
You gotta rob Peter to pay the paw

You better make sure it's what you want
When you ask the monkey's paw

You might just get what you're asking for
When you hold the monkey's paw

Are you sure it's what you want?
Beware the monkey's paw
Is it what you need or what you want?

Is it what you want? - What you really want?
Is it what you need? - Do you really need it?

You better be sure it's what you want
When you ask the monkey's paw
You might just get what you're asking for
When you hold the monkey's paw
Are you sure it's what you want?
Beware the monkey's paw
You better be sure it's what you want
When you ask the monkey's paw
You might just get what you're asking for
When you hold the monkey's paw
Are you sure it's what you want?
Beware the monkey's pawUnderneath it all
We are all but the same
Defined by flesh, blood and bones
Something we cannot change

We seek to better ourselves
And our human intellect
Some seek to help you out 
While others seek to infect

There is a way that seems
Right to a man
But the end result is death

With lies and corrupt ideals
We're fed poisons everyday
To define wickedness and sin
From God's knowledge we must not stray

The fear of the lord
Is a fountain of life
To save you from
The snares of deathmy skin contracts 
bones are breaking and twisting
blood runs out of tears 
eyes are tumbling deep within
frowns are carving my skin

bones recontructs and straightens 
heart again is sucking blood
I behold again, still I can`t see
and so on with every breath-in and
breath-out(Instrumental)AWAKE FROM DEATH, DRY YOUR TEARS,

WORSHIP ME, AWAKE, REBORN,

AND YOU CUT YOUR SELF FROM ANOTHER MANS GOD

AND RISE IN GODLESS HELL, RISE IN GODLESS HELL.


FORGET THE PAST FOR NOW IS DEATH AND THE CHILL OF NEVER ENDING TORMENT.


LEAVE YOUR GRAVE, TIME STANDS STILL,

WALK WITH ME, UNEARTH, ALIVE,

AND YOU CUT YOUR SELF FROM ANOTHER MANS GOD

AND RISE IN GODLESS HELL, RISE IN GODLESS HELL.


..AND THE SPIRITS GATHER AT THE BECLOUDED ABYSS

WHERE FIRE DRAKES ARE CONSUMED BEFORE GREAT DESCENDING COLUMNS OF FIRE,

MISSHAPEN SOULS WRITHE IN THE DEVOURING BLAZE AS THE RAMPANT THUNDERING OF THE SERPENT HARNESS THE VOICE OF DEATH,

GREAT THRASHING WINGS SHATTER THE SILENCE OF EREBUS AND GIVE RISE TO THE PALE STYGIAN BEAST, WHO BECKONS ALL SHADOWS TO RISE IN GODLESS HELL,

RISE IN GODLESS HELL

AND HE'S COMING FOR YOU NOW..Onward!
To dethrone every king of every realm
Behold!
I am the savage thrusting the rusted
pike into your fatty gullet.
One by one, I'll watch your houses burn
and witness your bemused astonishment,
taste your sour fear, and bitter regret
as the fabric of everything unravels...
Storming with spite through darkness,
into the open heart of bloated greed.
Tonight we vanquish all that remains
to crush the crooked crown

On the unrelenting wind,
into the unknown
burning all which blocks
our path to glorySee them nap, they can't hear thee sing,
A fruitful creation, producing only sin.
Their fulcrum is not the heart, but the brain.
Don't confront them with their faith and they walk the path as sane.

Holding the self up high,
Angling for a meaningful constellation.

A hell made parenthesis,
They will never flee.
In their paralyzed dejected world,
They will always kneel.

Hear thee sing: Satan is the key,
The one and only truth.
Among us walk and listen and in the source of light you'll glisten.

Let the smell of brimstone linger in the air,
When the earth is christen again.

A lilt guides their fall among them,
Falling next to angels without a wing,
Into an emotional, drifting whirl of fire,
They can't hear the truth thee sing.

Hear Thee sing: Satan is the key,
The one and only truth.
Among us walk and listen and in the source of light you'll glisten.

Fall among them,
With the stars you once angled.
Fall among them,
Into the whirl where all your fears are channeled.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)You are so good and sweet
That's what they wait for
To make you bleed

Everyone here 
has come to stay
You have no fear
You don't see hate

Nothing is what it seems
There's so much more to see

This is a world ruled by evil
And we have to survive the best we can
Sometimes we wish to switch it off
But by the way
Our hearts are getting colder
So harder we can fight

Look behind you
There's someone ready to take what's yours
The survivor is the smartest evil, son of judas
Everyone for himself

The smartest becomes the winner
evil is the mind of the smart

This is a world ruled by evil
And we have to survive the best we can
Sometimes we wish to switch it off
But by the way
Our hearts are getting colder
So harder we can fight

This is a world ruled by evil
And we have to survive the best we can
Sometimes we wish to switch it off
But by the way
Our hearts are getting colder
So harder we can fight

Our enemies are close but
We're gonna make'em cry(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(You tell me.......)Astral magic arts
Venomous witches charms
Winds tear up the sky
Cursed we will fly

Riches we do claim
No power in the light of the day
We're the men with power to divine
Before the dawn our strength shall shine
The birth is sacrifice itself
The gateway to a living hell
Disclose the chapter of alchemy
To praise the act of blasphemy

We are the righteous and the pure
We live to challenge whatever may occureWe're in the beginning of the end of time,
in the middle of the countdown
It's impossible to turn around, but who's aware of it?

Lost in the fields of thick deceptions
Up all nights and all days, creating more goals
based on worldly views

Here it is, anywhere we look around we'll see
proof of mankind's grand achievements
backed by technological sophistication
But should we proud of it?

Lost in the fields of thick deceptions
Up all nights and all days, creating more goals
based on worldly views, in worldly ways

What's in our minds?
With all these philosophical kinds of modern frames
A new-found old insanity as we
Lost in the fields of thick deceptions
Up all nights and all days, creating more goals
based on worldly views, in worldly waysAll dressed in uniforms so fine,
They drank and killed to pass the time,
Wearing the shame of all their crimes,
With measured steps, they walked in line.

They walked in line...

They carried pictures of their wives,
And numbered tags to prove their lives,
They walked in line...

Full of glory never seen,
They made it through the whole machine,
To never question anymore,
Hypnotic trance, they never saw,
They walked in line...

They walked in line..."Three simple words. I am gay."Heading straight into this purple haze smeared cross the sky 
Enters my body shoots into the back of my mind 
Slowly I'm losing vision all structure of my being 
Ripping the forces that mold the in between 

How can it be, I know I'm in this moment, yet here time begins to cease. 
As my body begins to deconstruct, fibers of the skin become unwoven, 
As I start to dissolve into the same, Magnetic haze, like grains of sand, 
Only held together by faint kinetic fields 
The constant movement of this cosmic blue, Concept of existence becoming unglued 
Time Frozen In this Moment 

As particles start to collide 
I focus all I can 
Rebuild a form of self 
Through this now I can see 
What must be left behind 
Swim towards the open 
This moment breaks away 
The shimmer dissipatingI chose this place because it has no bottom to interfere with my fall
Anaerobic beds of silt preserving still the shock of what I saw
Vivid descriptions I'd do anything to forget
But here I am crushed by a million frigid tons of regret
I will rest in one piece away from clawed things that would otherwise eat all that's left of me
The world is not ready for what I saw down there
That fateful day starting an endless autumn, words did seer my pupils
Liquid acrylic quickly will freeze a broken will in water heavy as tar
Somebody please take me to the deep where I can carry the weight of this burden you left for me to bare in frigid waters high above my head
Surrounded by all the dead frozen like me in the saltless sea
You can pay your respects at the shore now
Goodbye, my love...we cannot exist without exposure to adversity 
for life itself is spiced by elements of pain 
learning how to weather the storm that passes day by day 
remaining vigilant as far as mind can see 
to begin with, seasons are here for us to watch 
sometimes imaginations set us up for troubles 
as age flies by we cling to the first importance 
regain a footing after all the loss and failures 
find a way to ease our pain 
life unfolds in a passage of time 
bringing forth the sense of hope 
here we are, off we go 

[september 2013 - march 2014]Through time, I found my way.
A stoned path, I had to go.
Trough pain, i learned to live.
A blooming out, for creation.

Depressive truth,
I drained my life through pain.
A flattening of emotions, all I gained.
I sank deep within my inner-self.
A depression my first lesson.

This time, I had to face.
To live or die, my choice was clear.
Resigned to live, life is to survive.
Survive is to struggle.

Depressive truth.
I drained my life through pain.
A flattening of emotions, all I gained.
I sank deep within my inner-self.
A depression my first lesson.(Instrumental)I cross a new border now in appointment of sickness
So my bowels are going to recall not for long but better then now
Now you know what I mean empty words you don't care
Till now I'm gonna show you my dreams bowel movement
I give up for more flair

Fecal overdose - fecals on my nose
Fecals everywhere defection I don't care

Several times I vomit out black blood it must be the first effect
Slowly I am poisoned my skin turns to green and sometimes my dick is erect
Now your know what I mean a kind of medical project
No one tried it before cause it ends with a bitter death

Fecal overdose - fecals on my nose
Fecals everywhere stool fun I don't care

I vomit out my innards the spasm over me
This nasty satisfaction used to set me freeBlood Omen

The tide is turning 
The dark slides in
This is our time to move
Nail that fucker to his throne

Restrict their motion 
Constrict their throats
Silence their words of doubt
Nail their bodies to the ground

Fire in eyes
The pagans rise
As old gods sing
And fill the skies

Crucified 
The bastard flies
Back to the east
His crown denied 

The Sunwheel rise again
The Sunwheel rise againI seek revenge upon the false
I want to see you dead killing you flatline
I know your names

You spread your lies to make yourself the bigger one
You think that your lies will get rid of me
Face to face you are always acting as a friend
But I know you are false and now it's stabbing time

Massacre
There will be blood everywhere
I will enjoy your death, screams and blood
To see your life end with pain

Bleeding the false

This is a dream that comes true
Twisting my knife inside you
I am the last you will see
Now it's time to bleed for me

Another one is dead but there are more to kill
You are next your blood I spill
You know I am coming for you now so be prepared
I will not stop until your kind is dead

Massacre
There will be blood everywhere
I will enjoy your death, screams and blood
To see your life end with pain

Bleeding the false

This is a dream that comes true
Twisting my knife inside you
I am the last you will see
Now it's time to bleed for me

I follow you around
I study your moves
I look for weaknesses
Death I bring to you
When the time is right
I will make my move
Twisting the knife
I will love killing you

I stab you
Over and over again
I stab you stab you
Over and over again
Kill kill kill kill
kill kill kill kill(Instrumental)They did not bring me up to pay respect to Jesus Christ
A holy prayer was never said to save me from the night
On my walls you will never see a holy crucifix
I live my life to the fullest I don't follow the Christian Faith

I will burn
In Hell I burn, swallowed by flames
Born to burn fire embrace
I will burn
With no regrets, none at all,
I won't take back the sins I've done
I walk this earth with my own views
Through holy eyes I will burn

Proud to be the man I am and all I have achieved
No holy army will stop me to live the life I live
Unclean one you will burn in Hell you point at me and say
So be it, but here on Earth spit in your fucking face

I will burn
In Hell I burn, swallowed by flames
Born to burn fire embrace
I will burn
With no regrets, none at all,
I won't take back the sins I've done
I walk this earth with my own views
Through holy eyes I will burn

They did not bring me up to pay respect to Jesus Christ
A holy prayer was never said to save me from the night
On my walls you will never see a holy crucifix
I live my life to the fullest I don't follow the Christian Faith

I will burn
In Hell I burn, swallowed by flames
Born to burn fire embrace
I will burn
With no regrets, none at all,
I won't take back the sins I've done
I walk this earth with my own views
Through holy eyes I will burnSyncronized and bright, a calculated fall
Into the unforgiving void
Cold sodium light, a voiceless call
Into the silence we deploy

Adrift in space
Elated soul parade
Adrift in space
Listless and afraid

A trust of souls, to the god-machine
Into stellar schoals, through the nebular stream
Sails on altars high, a binary death-scream
Farewell life-support, enter the darkest dream

I feel so scared
We are all lost
Out here...

An ionized caress, oh, ghostly touch
As S:t Elmo rests in space
A song of distress, as we helplessly watch
The blind destruction of our race

Adrift in space, but I still adore her
Elated soul parade, our derelict mother
Wounded and scared, as deep inside her
We try to repair, our dying sundiver

I feel so scared... 
Adrift in space... 
I feel so scared...Eyes of envy stares at me they hope I fail
Anything to make me disappear
All the lies, all the tricks deception
You want what you cannot have

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

For many years they have tried to take my throne
But when I dress for war they retreat
All the words, all the talk behind my back
You will shake like a leaf if we meet

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Watch your step don't come near I'm warning you
Cross the frontier and you are dead
This is not empty threats I'm warning you
I stand behind the words I have said

Every step you take towards me is one step closer to your death

Eyes of envy stares at me they hope I fail
Anything to make me disappear
All the lies, all the tricks deception
You want what you cannot have

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

For many years they have tried to take my throne
But when I dress for war they retreat
All the words, all the talk behind my back
You will shake like a leaf if we meetLeft, right 
Scum with no sight 
Nowhere safe to hide

Act like a dog about to bite
Inside walls all around(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Relentless Pain
It is the year of ultimate darkness
Where all shall expire in fear
Pain is on the way - suffering from today
Torment we all are feeling
Persistent Pain puts you on the edge of sanity 
As the world begins to rot
A destructive scheme of brutality 
From your societies control sick top 
Marching from the north, step by step they change the world
The sky is thick with smoke from their cyclone technology
The snow is black falling from above in wet chunky balls
"We shall die, we shall die, we shall die!" 
Now you wander out in the night as the rest
Spitting out your guts to put you to the test
Nothing will remain in your thoughtless shell
Forever a creature in your own incarnated hell
A legion of brainwashed minions will strain you to your bed
Barbwire cuts your skin as the plunger hits your brain
You hold your breath in pain when reality begins to fade
A zombie of society as they put your soul in chains 
It is the year of ultimate darkness
Where all shall expire in fear
Pain is on the way - suffering from today
Torment we all are feelingOwe yourself, but no one else
Behind your eyes, inside your head
Reach in, but don't reach out
I'll come and try, if only in vain
I've never watched in shame, I've never watched in vain
Don't ever change no, just stay the same...Yes it was, it was like a bad vision I saw so many times
I still remember - her eyes were closed by powers of the sea

It was always revolting from the depth
It was always arising by storms
If you only know who am I
It was always

You feel so free, Atlantis fell and they've lost control
Coz you've seen seen crumbling colums
And the island in a smoke

Atlantis, Atlantis falls down
Atlantis, Atlantis goes down
Atlantis, Atlantis don't die
Atlantis...

By the painful eyes of the ancient gods
Take a look at the sky
Everyone is here where the thunder sounds
Where the lightning apart

By the painfull eyes of the ancient gods
Through the dark smooth surfase
Up the rising sun, down the blackest grave
You must never forget

And now you won
You are so glorious but you'll never see
The obedience of ancient nation
Now the ocean is the home(Instrumental)Let me tell you
I love you
It's true
I love you

But I gotta tell you, babe
I made a mistake
I hope you'll understand
And take me by the hand

I didn't mean for it to happen
No, I love you
It was a one-time thing
And it was wrong

Take me back
Tell me you're mine
Shower me with lovin'
All of the time

Romance is a flower
Love is like a sun
Friendship is a river
Desire is a burning fire

I love you, yes I do
I really do 
I want it to be true
I love you, yes I do

Just me and you...these can't be growing pains 
i don't see the growth 
i only feel the pain 
all the way i have bled 
through my wound of desolation 
from now to infinite future 
desire keeps me yearning 
to shuffle dreams and reality 
embody my core of what is destiny(Instrumental)(Instrumental)incinerating eyes augur climax, cloaked by shadow and a threat
watch it fall away lay eyes on hell behin
bring forth belligerence, dissolve delinquency
no martyr shall be spawned when this narration comes to pass
the rate for 30 pieces of silver no equals the delaction of being struck by agony
all debts rebound for deeds in a grievous memory
perceptual dubiety for matters lost in time
a boney hand reaching for a gentle touch
douse in a mere of blood, girded servant
bathe in squalor
welcome to the miscreant castle
cast aside illusions of conceit
embrace the warmth of torture
sprung from a self planted seed
indulge in ripping hatred
constellations formed by words in ambiguity
evoke the dirae
time has elapsed for mending
all wounds turned to purulent scars
compassion torn asunder
years of decay tamper the mind
into the frey
be born anew
ease and relish before the last throat is cut
die wretched one
indulge in endemic fate
shrive now"dengan takjub, ku amati bulan yang menerangi terang di celah-celah awan ini, ku tatapi pedangku yang berlumuran darah dengan bangga kerana 
dengan Pedang Ellah ini, ku tamatkan riwayat-Nya..."Desolaat gevangenschap!
Desolaat gevangenschap!(Instrumental)CRAZY BLOOD-STAINED SKY.

FIRE WE'VE FORGOTTEN. COME
SOON. RAGING ON OUR LAND.
WE, THE CURSED CHILDREN
OF A DYING FATHER.
DIG US DEEP IN THE SOIL.

COLD OUR HANDS.
JOINED OUR BONES.
FIRE CAME TODAY.
FOLD OUR HANDS.
LAY OUR HEADS DOWN
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.
WHERE ARE YOU SHINING STAR,
FIRE ON THE WIND?
COVER OUR EYES WITH
A BLACK LAYER OF ASH
THAT NEVER GOES AWAY.

FATHER, COME BACK.
WE ARE STRANGER BEINGS.
ATTENUATED.
BLESSED IN ALL OUR SHAPES.
OUR SKIN MELTS LIKE WATER.
AWAY BENEATH US.
RISING UP FOREVER.
RISING UP FOREVER.
WE ARE STRANGER BEINGS.
MADE OF PURE LIGHT.
SINGING SONGS.
GOD CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN
AND CLOSED OUR EYES.
WE RISE UP FOREVER.Welcome to the grandest illusion of sense of purpose 
To destroy in the name of all greater creation 
This existence is narrowing its own extinction 
Advancement of knowing yet now it is shown that we've learned nothing 

We'll die in Wars, We'll sell our souls 
Fire in the air 
To set the mark If I were God, I'd flood the land 

Watch the empires crumble as the waves crash against the remnants left 
of the towers built spiraling to the sky now exactly where all shall remain 

Slaves to the grind trying hard to define this life by means of material greed 
When the reaper comes forth we're all merely feed for the cycle and nothing more 

Now watch as the Empires crumble into nothing 
Waves crash against the slain 
The towers now torn apart 
World gone, now known 
From which we came we shall remainUniverse fallen
Balance Fades
Monster approaching

Falling down
In the ocean
Swallowed
By our mortal nature
As we cleave
The seas of extinction
Huge waves
Dissipate our colligation

Fight, reborn, live
Till end come
Saved, strong, calm
New home

Wake up
Oh oh, new sun
Heal us
Beget us
Soothe your heart
Invulnerable again
The tempest is gone
The circle establishedThe real Amber is the only one. All the rest ones are it's reflections And the farther you go the stranger landscape becomes and the stranger the creatures living in this place seems to be. Only the real successor of the throne in the veins of whom runs the blood of the kings of Amber will be able to control the reflections & to find the road back to his home. But every road leads to Amber.(Instrumental)The pain is real
Those things we see
And touch and feel

Loathing torment
No reprieve
I still remember
A love of life

I believed that life was lost
As deaths embrace engulfed like frost
Through the air filled with despair
Blood-pooled fingers coldly caress

Death brings insight
Darkness brings light
Suffer in pain
Staining my brain

Will you ever wake from void
Your eyes filled with frozen slumber

Let the wind take your soul
On a journey through the vast unknownAutumn came here and heaven drop out their tears
 Yellow leafs falling down
 They are cover the cold ground
 Dead trees stay around
 This autumn know no bounds
 Very strange desires appear and disappear
 Aither autumn born in the fire
 Or the fire came right here
 Feeling of the endless pain
 Surround me on all sights
 The blood is get cold in my veins
 And i close my tired eyes
 Birds are fly away... So far away
 Sadness come to me because i can't be free
 I'm stell sobbing, tears are falling
 From my colourness eyes on my palms
 I've broke my fragile wings
 I've trew out their with cold wind
 So let they will fly And i will cry
 I feel depressed, but i get used to lonelyness
 I've ran, until be left alone
 I will bathing in my autumn dreams
 Dancing with the foliage
 I will sinking in this blazing streams
 And i will forget my rage.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)"One of blood, 
of greed, 
of ice and fire. 
The Blue liquid Lips await. 
Unveiling another is the son that would have been. 
Strength and scales betrayed. 
Strength and scales betrayed. 
Robbing the maiden, 
a trial begins.""One of greed, 
one of ice, 
one of fire! 
Robbing the maiden,

She gazes the festered heart, 
surging blue ink. 
Like the sound of her lips and a whisper. 
This table is fit for dancing,

Words of wanderers
Come to squander us
Out by the east tower
Saw a campfire
Some of our brothers 
Came back covered in blood
Gather your weapons, Take your positions
We must stand and fight, for what our kind have won, And lost

(Shadows past, Voices near, Elvish - words I cannot hear)

Into the darkness
On to the dark hall
There the battle won
Show no mercy 
No Forgiveness
War till fucking death!

We are out numbered 
And falling fast
I don't know how long we can last
These humans came here
Day after day
To rule our home in there own fucking way
The forest beckons 
It calls our name
We leave tonight in the pouring rain
There's a war between us
We'll be back to fight
With all sworn foes of the Mimbrate knights,

Peace short lived 
War up on you
Await our revenge.
Look to the west 
For our coming
For our hateI lie buried in a dark forgotten tomb
Restless nightmare endlessly haunting my sleep
In my skin three eyes are carved
Starring in silence from inside deep

Into the crypt of desolation
And far beneath the stairs of life
Trapped in a casket of poisoning air
Formed as a piercing, redeeming knife

But blessed  be thy holy cancer
That stalks this worthless void
And infected in the water of life
For all to us to drink
For all to us to serve
To breathe the air of a spiritual night

It flows thick like misty darkness
Through the golden streams of paradise
Black drops falling upon my bleak skin
Oh what a sight for those eyes!

I lie buried in a dark forgotten grave
Created by life-giving human blood
So let my grave be overflown
By the funeral poison of MY GOD!

So blessed by the holy cancer
That stalks this worthless void
And infected in the water of life
For all to us to drink
For all to us to serve
To open this coffin
And see thy light!You speak of armageddon and hell
Those who follows you, they will all be blessed
But the answers you seek is opaque
How can you still believe in such a lie

Holy bible was written by man
Not by divine or superior hand
Once you see this you might see that you're fooled
It's all about control of mankind

I am godless i salute my desires and i
Take responsibilities for all my actions
Won't need a fake god to hide my fear of the unknown
Don't try to look down on me because i can see through you

Soon you will see
There's no god you will see you're fooled
Just as the ones you fooled too
There is no such thing as christ
He was crowned hanged to a cross
And he bleed as he was pierced in
His side on the cross of calvary

You're telling lies and you're fooling the week ones
And you're feeding on their loss and their death is your profit
As they're starving to death
You are preaching, spreading lies how to live

You will suffer no god shall save you
I will show you no mercy for this
If you'll pray then you will see who is right
Jehova is nothing but hoax

I am godless i salute my desires and i
Take responsibilities for all my actions
Won't need a fake god to hide my fear of the unknown
Don't try to look down on me because i can see through youYour words replaying in my head 
On my course to you 
Like swimming in the blackest sea 
Yet I feel serenity 

Sudden clinging, like a cloak draped over, changing the path. 
Pushing pulling move. Feel the drag of the moon. 

I try to swim and break away 
Harder as I near 
Intoxicating poison beams 
Keep me locked in place 

In a state of paralysis, I struggle to breathe, 
Trapped by submission that I must break, 
flooding my mind with memories, 
keep me from slipping Into the depths, 
wrapping my body like vines 

I Break free 
Can't go back 
Center align 
Pivot myself back into the stream(Instrumental)The rotten world
The betrayed people scream
The dreams that have died out
Wrath, chaos, cry

Flame of freedom, flame
Crushes and destroys fear
Your blood's boiling
That's enough

You're sick of it
Your fist clenching
No more time

From treason storm unknown time
Sea of lies isflooding world
Your world

Day by day
I know tomorrow that comes
Bitter taste
Will continue in my dreams

Before dusk will surround you
Before time will stop forever
Dont give a fuck just be tough
Grasp your sword
Fight for your world

Until you are strong
Cos the stake here is your lifeWhenever I see you
You move in a trail of colours
Paint my heart and light up my life
Just like a guiding light

There's no world without you
You're a special creative, a muse
A work of art on every wall
The tattoo smile upon my face only when we are together

Every day, every place, every way
You're the queen of charm for humanity
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I love you
Every day, every place, every way
You're my night and my every single day
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I need you
You're my madness, you're my life
Woman this is for you

Wherever I see you
A flame lights up within me
Even songs and poetry, talk a little about you and me

'Cause you are passion,
you're beauty and temptation
I'll bring you the stars tonight... To offer you a gift
I will give you my wings to fly forever

Every day, every place, every way
You're the queen of charm for humanity
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I love you
Every day, every place, every way
You're my night and my every single day
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I need you
You're my madness, you're my life
Woman this is for you(Instrumental)Living in the night
'Neath devils torn asunder
You call on me to solve a crooked rhyme
As I'm closing in
Imposing on your slumber
You call on me as bells begin to chime

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Hiding from the light
Sacrificing nothing
Still you call on me for entrance to the shrine
Hammering the nails
Into a sacred coffin
You call on me for powers clandestine

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hear the screams on the battlefield

Strike them down and be freeFighting for breath...a hideous sound
Sealed in a tomb, immured all around
Depths of the mind hold deepest dark fears
Crawl to the end, life's spark disappears
Broken fingers caress this mortal tomb
Desire to live, the end coming soon
Soul locked within and left for remiss
A cargo so dear trapped in this abyss

Trapped in this tomb
Gasping for air
Trapped in this tomb

Losing the mind, a slow labored path
Driven insane by this labyrinth of death
Judgement was passed...all hope is foregone
The body still reels...the mind carries on!
Crushing despair a sobering fact
Suffocation...the bitter last act
Deny the end, the mind cannot rest
The body fights, this slow certain death!

Trapped in this tomb
Gasping for air
Trapped in this tomb

Longing to live all hope fades away
Reflect on my past, rejecting my grave
Pray to the lord my pleas will be met
Damned to the darkness...so much regret!
Is there a place in heaven for me?
To fly with the angels and finally be free
Or banished from heaven...and cast into hell
To serve as a slave...time will tell!

Only time will tell!

Time will tell!

Only time will tell!!Archaic wasteland mitigation command
Graveyard passivation unihabited indignation
Archaic wasteland crater hurling into the eve
Later yearning to deceive past starforests rise
Archaic wasteland dies
The hidden process of hostility
Certainly increases the chances for mobility
Star stream patters odd in size
Archaic wastelands timely demise
Star stream pattern unsterilized
The new wasteland disguised(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Track list:

4. Christbait Rising
5. Avalanche Master SongJoy is slowly turning 
Into forgetfulness
Painful conviction is calling story
I'm following traces of lost fate
Calling cursed name of fate
I'm rising my hands
Taking conviction
On last cry of crack mouth
I'm throwing holy words in heaven
Words of last thirst
Only my words
Meaningless commentary
No one is already able to answerSonic demons piercing skulls
Angels in darkness of fear
Pieces of peace never together
I hunger your flesh so pure
Hear the howl of the beast
Nornhy moans of the witch
Led to the sabbath unholy
I take your protected innocence
No love will save us
No hate can stop us
Together we rise above
Together we rule it allRising into a blackened sky, an elven sword
held aloft
'o Elberth' I hear their cry, glamdring
cleaving orken flesh
The battle is high, give your light unto us
Orcrist foe of the dark smite those of
evil wrath
Casting spells, crafting nature's path, calling
your power
o Elberth queen of souls, elven runes hold
your power
o Elberth light in dark, grant me
enlightened visions
o ElberthI heard once
The wind roar in trees
I heard once
Children laugh
And I cried
For the lost life

Let them discover solitude
Let them discover every sorrow
"And I will give you hope" said the master
But it is already not there
Let them discover love
Let them discover every day
"And I will give you hope" said the master
But it is already not there

Decay is their play
Despair is their game
And only screams can be heard
When tears wake them from their dreams

This dark night - Kills me
This cold night - Kills me

There's only chaos around
Sunk in solitude
They can only see a black shadow
Murmur wakes them from their dreams

And her solitude - beauty
And her loving - beauty
And killing her - beauty
And her rebirth - beauty

In the name of the father
I die every night
In the name of the father
The only way left for mePoliticians, teachers, businessmen or priests
Exemplary fathers from good families
The serious gentlemen dressed in suits and ties
Walk around the streets and looking for young beings

Parents do dirty business, the government is blind
The sex selfdom of children, police don't mind

They go often to visit young children
From neighbourhoods of poor states
There it's easy to buy them for a few bucks
Perverted sexual pigs and their children's paradise

The pervert uncles from abroad
Don't care about children souls
They like soft little hands

This consumption of life wants more and more
Their desire and greediness lose all control
The mass media shows us what's needful to buy
Young people with no respect, value and right

Parents do dirty business, the government is blind
None of small prostitutes anyone want to know
The sex selfdom of children, police don't mind
Who will stop this abuse and send the beasts to jail

Crazy and sick families send them on the street
There the rich deviants are hungry for young meat

Their mothers want a full account in the banks
Fathers need more for alcohol and drugsDear god of the bent trees 
only pour my willful dust up your veins 
and I'll pound your belly flat world 
in praise of small agonies 
fuck your only begotten cobalt dream 
to filter golden pleasure 
through your apple glutted heaven 
filter the uncircumcized sin of my heart.Day of Death

Hate the day that I go away
Leave my friends while they pray
When I disapere into the sky
I can't say them goodbye

Why we all go dying
People are crying
I don't no were we're going
But we're all still following

Why do we all die
Why can't we stay allive
Why do we all die
Can't no one survives

Why we all go dying
People are crying
Death is something special in our lives
Because no one can survive

Day of death
Day of death


Why are we all dying
People are crying
I don't no were we're going
But we're all still following

Why do we all die
Why can't we stay alive
Why do we all die
Can't no one survives

Hate the day that I go away
Leave my friends while they pray
When I disapere into the sky
I can't say them goodbye

Hate the day that I go away
Leave my friends wile they pray
When I disapere into the sky
I can't say them goodbyeWelcome little children
At play among the tombs
A trail of treats will lead you
into candy covered rooms

Granite pestles crush their tiny pelvises to dust
Smashing with unholy lust

You and your burnout friends
Were suckered by the witch's tale
Caves replete the devil's leaf
And a map for sale

So, to the catacombs
With plunder as your goal
Stumble bums, trap door sprung
You were knocked out cold

Welcome lonely traveler
Engaged in self abuse
Your love for iron maidens
Will be put to grizzly use

Piercing shrieks of torture from behind a metal mask
Blood collects in oaken cask

You hear a muffled scream
Through a fleshly mortared crypt
Slimy tendrils coat the walls 
Where the coffin juices drip

A filthy denim vest
You find abandoned on the chamber floor
Mortal fear; your blood runs cold
At the sound of a creaking door

The screams of your friends echo from afar
Panicked, you race through the torch lit halls
Into the Abattoir

Kill!
Kill!
Kill!

You fall to your knees
In human debris
And we chortle at your feeble cries

You kick and you scream 
As you're dragged 'cross the floor
No mercy, no pity, your destined to die

In our inner sanctum
Chained to the floor of a catacomb cell
In our inner sanctum
You will be wracked with the tortures of hell
In our inner sanctum
Tears stream from your bloodshot eyes
In our inner sanctum 
Die!You're so afraid when you cross his eyes 
Don't make a sound he can hear everything 
And in a fight his fangs will bite you 
To the blood, to the bone 
Chipping the flesh 

Wolf, high handed 
Wolf, fast heartbeat 
Wolf, prey hunter 
Wolf, night watcher 

Born in fury he won't be stopped 
Driven by fire, consumed by anger 
Kill to eat, follow the moon 
Until dawn he will not sleep 

You're so afraid when you cross his eyes 
Don't make a sound he can hear everything 
And in a fight his fangs will bite you 
To the blood, to the bone 
Chipping the fleshSunday's gloomy
Your hours are slumberless
Dear mess, the poseurs
You've lived with are numberless
Brand new white sneakers
Will never awaken you
Not once the Swamp Hag Zurylada
Has taken you

Angels have no thought
Of ever protecting you
They won't be angry
When I am done with killing you

GLOOMY SUNDAY

Gloomy is Sunday
With poseurs you've spent it all
My knife and I
Have decided to end it all
Soon there will be candles
And praters that are said, I know
Let them weep, let them know
That you had to go

Death is no dream
To your doom I am sending you
To the last inch of your soul
I am cursing you

GLOOMY SUNDAY(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Go and bury everything
All your memories
All your thoughts
Bury your dearest things

To one black pit
Leave it all
And don't look back
With no remorse

When something in your life
Had broken and can't be healed
You don't care successes you reached
For all these years

Want to erase it all
Not a memory to remain of you
In this world
Going to darkness
 
All is buried, all is buried
All is buried now
You are going away
But I have to stay
Alone in the dark
That's my name
All is buried, all is buried
All is buried now
You are going away
But I have to stay
Alone in the dark
In my grave

You loved me much
As a part of your life
How can I tell you
That soon I have to die

Don't want to hurt you
Don't want you to cry
If only you could
Forget me at this time

Bury me as your
Inviolable treasure
Bury me as a key 
To your pleasure

Bury me in your heart
Drown me in your blood
And don't remember me anymore
Bury it all(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Bearing weight of mountains of grief on my soul
Silent waters rise as the nightmares unfold 
Forever shrouded lies my universe
And frozen the fields of my heart

Severance
Severance

Burning images of truth forgotten haunt my days
Fractured memories, surrendered all my hopes and ways
Feeding the demon, how can I live with this stone in my breast,
I can feel the wind turn north-northwest

When did this start, how will this end, 
what horrid future lies around the bend

(I) brace myself against the onslaught of the dark
Please return to thaw the insides of my heart
With fear I grasp the cramped and severed cord
And try to find my way back home to the lord

Severance - cold sweat dews mourning dawn
Severance - I cry of all my hopes forlorn

...And night comes whispering to me, 
the cold hands of temptation they poison my soul

Severance - cold sweat dews mourning dawn
Severance - I cry of all my hopes forlorn

Bearing weight of mountains of grief on my soul
Silent waters rise as the nightmares unfold
Forever shrouded lies my universe
And frozen the fields of my heart(Instrumental)I stand beside myself
And look back at all I've done
The mirror reflects the truth
It says my pain has just begun

The world crumbles away
And I struggle to find my place
It seems that we will never change

This burden drags me down
As the cities turn to ash
We threw it all away
And it all came down so fast

The world crumbles away
And I struggle to find my place
It seems that we will never change
The world crumbles away
And I know now only pain
And now it seems we won't be savedIve the smallest recollection of
humanity and the grace of men.
Before everything fell into darkness

fell into darkness

I awoke into a nightmare

Deafening screams filled the petrified air

Chaos lurked through my senses

As i rose to find the source of the resounding confusion
A vision raced before my straining eyes
A shape in the dark, but not a form of familiarity
I fled through doors to find not but havoc and maelstrom

There was men and women filling the streets
Only to be ravaged by dark shapes of beasts
Rivers of blood raced through the city artery
Lit only by the occasional city light
Running and racing i fled through scenes of death
Only to find explosions as gas tanks found fire

As i awoke my eyes burned with light
A pain upon my mind of horrid dreams
Yet as the brilliance left my eyes
I found horror in what i saw around me

There were bodies upon bodies in the streets
Ravaged by those dark shapes of beasts
The city's artery caked and stained in blood
I quickly withdrew my sight and lost all control
As i grasped my head in my hands.. screams
I lost track of existence as horror raged all around

It's all gone.. existence!
Nothing left.. armageddon!
Spawn of hell.. took it all!
Chaos grips me.. the name of god?!

My mind has found utter fucking hell!

I've the smallest recollection of
sanity before they came here
Before the day hell broke loose

As i taste this cold steel..
Such be the fate of men that day
When the bowers of hell rose up
The fiends shall have their vengence
All that remains.. Sanity's Final RequiemI am the daughter of the Ancient Mother, 
I am the child 
of the Mother of the World. 
I am your daughter 
O Ancient Mother, 
I am your child 
O Mother of the World. 

O Inanna! O Inanna! 
O Inanna! 

It is you who teaches us 
to die, To be reborn and rise again. 
Die, be reborn, and rise! 
History and Lore 
Queen of Heaven and EarthA merciless hunter killing for game
Fighting forever a dying race
As we are one and waiting to be
To kill this creature who can never be seen
Trying to protect this land from misery
This jungle is massive it could swallow us all

Lurking behind the still silent tree
Upon entry there is no return
A sea of blood begins to rise
The enemy that only your hate fulfills

He fears no man
But what lurks through the woods will  devour his heart
Body count rise, spines smashed to dust
Gore filled pits, Carcass, Stench, Arise
Vultures feast, they fill the sky
Strangled by intestine, on humanity it feeds

Collection of skulls, a trophy for its hunt
Apathy consumes it, no remorse 
All dead but one, Cunning skills or just luck
Impales the beast, it lets a sadistic cry

The deadly advance led by hunger
Roaming the killing fields for a chance to feed
Outstretched claws
Bestial Mindset becomes aware
Trying to lure the victim into its lair

Lurking behind the still silent tree
Upon entry there is no return
A sea of blood begins to rise
The enemy that only your hate fulfills

He fears no man
But what lurks through the woods will  devour his heart
Body count rise, spines smashed to dust
Gore filled pits, Carcass, Stench, Arise
Vultures feast, they fill the sky
Strangled by intestine, on humanity it feedsPray to god / that we're not here
Don't look back / we'll dissolve
We all / suffer
No decree / eternityhaunted by memories
of the pain
inflicted upon thy flesh
can never escape the pain

reflecting on the pain
waiting in vain
engulfed in the flames

tormented by inner demons
perpetuating their despair
haunted by memories
suffer in solitude

solace, contemplate, recreate bitterness

breeding these visions in solitude
reflections so hard to escapeIn my personal silence
 I'm painting a picture
 The collage of wistfulness
 Reminding of you

 This horrid numbness
 Perfect paralyzis
 Beautiful emptiness

 Urge to smash my reflection
 Lust to tear my face apart
 I feel like i'm divided by zero

 In hourglass
 I'm choking to the sand
 How to turn this thing
 Rewind everything

 Just like my mind hanging,
 On a rope as thin as hair
 I wouldn't even want to bother
 I don't want to care

 Longing
 I'm screaming
 Depression
 My eyes wont stop leaking

 Just like my mind hanging,
 On a rope as thin as hair
 I wouldn't even want to bother
 I don't want to careSomewhere in the night a fallen priest
Celebrates a mass in the name of the beast
He gives into his lust and breaks his vow
He serves a different master now

In the darkened chapel
He feeds her the apple
He leads her into temptation
And reaps the reward of his damnation

Unholy acts and blasphemous rites
The bishop smiles as the clock strikes midnight
His morals fail, her inhibitions falter
He ravishes the lusty lass on the altar

Pretty little Polly, the bishop's folly
Virgin blood for the taking
Debased and deflowered in the darkest hour
In the name of Satan!

In the darkened chapel
He feeds her the apple
The ways of Christ denied
The bishop satisfied!!!

He dedicates this house of God to evil
Disciples gather to honor the Devil
Through a secret door in the garden wall
Comes the Hellfire Club into Lartington Hall

Peni tenti non PenitentoBLOODSTAINED HUMAN REMAINS

(music by Vadim Nikolaev; lyrics by Alex Pishikin)

the flame of life is dying down
 eternal 
 winter is coming
 the sunlight is consumed by dark
 the day has 
 turned into the night
 among the pitch darkness
 in the fog 
 of emptiness
 the sinister moon is grinning
 in the distance 
 and can not almost be seen

It's freezing spectral light
 is occasionally seeping through the haze
 your eyes got used to the darkness
 but fear is parilizing you

penetrating deep into your soul
 dispirited, demoralized
 by what you see around
 bloodstained human remains
 underfoot and round you

a medley of bodies,  all of them are dead
 senseless war, senseless death
 bloodstained human remains
 underfoot and round youFrom the dead bodies 
Nine glaring souls arise 
Forming a figure 
A predator fluffy as mice 

An ancient evil 
Older than time itself 
Worse than the 
Antichrist 

More adorable than 
An unicorn 
A perfect killer 
In disguise 

While awakening 
It devours the man 
Sucking away 
All the light 

Almost like a black hole 
Filled with furballs inside 
With paws prettier than paintings 
Treacherous as a glass of wine 

But before the world domination 
It must complete the ritual 
Cleanse itself from the blood 
And growl a sharp Meow 

All hail 
All hail 
ALL HAIL THE CATAn empty canvass waits for me,
And I have a palette of dreams to paint your face.
To paint those memories I have of you,
The way your are in my thoughts

A different way of living, of being as one.
Not like the way we used to be.
The burning Sun is on my back again,
And its time to face it's light.

Those memories I have of you are twisted by time.
And that very way I used to be, is now just a memory.

Orphaned dreams I have of you,
I've grown tired of their flaws.
Your colours are all tainted,
And time has moved on your tired face.

A different way of living, of being as one.
Not like the way we used to be.Oh what glorious fields we have reaped
Brazen, envenomed with pride
In circular motion we harvest defeat
On the gallows the tide turns to night 
Luna wakes to illuminate deeds to be done in the shelter of darkness
Thus betrayed we claim schemes to be less than they seem and divide to hush up our departures
Ominous shadows and bringers of light gather up the droppings of angels
Then at cockcrow they hurry for a place to be buried and their arrogance turns to the coldest of despairs
...ah

Territus terreo!

Slave to our meaningless goals we crawl
Torn between heaven and hell
Humana sighs, to vermin and filth she's born
And duly serves her helpless masters well

And now, by our burden of sins
We are drawn down upon our knees
Again to crawl as we used to do

With the fields now infertile we turn
And blame the blood of our brothers
The sky shall grow black as we burn
And our smoke is reversed by the heavens

Luna wakes...(Instrumental)(I'm a worm)

Lying dead, in the grave,
Deep down in the ground
Awakened by the burial
Feast. your flesh begins
Smell, your skin begins to,
Rot. worms are attacking
Now, no way for escaping
Fate. eaten through the black
Boiled flesh. the eyes are
Ejecting a yellow fluid. they
Flesh consume, when you
Take your last breath. they
Flesh consume, worms are
Feasting your death. i'm a
Worm,... lying dead, in the
Grave, deep down in the
Ground. awakened by the
Burial feast. i also feed on
Human flesh, cutting my
Harmless victims with a
Jigsaw. i like to eat
Decomposed lungs hearts
Arms or legs. i'm like a
Worm, and i feel like a
Worm. i rip out the eyes and
And will eat away your tongue. i
Will eat you alive, till your last
Breath. eaten through the black
Boiled flesh. the eyes are
Ejecting a yellow fluid. thy
Flesh consume, when you take
Your last breath. thy flesh
Consume, worms are feasting
Your death. i'm a worm,...So she climbs 
The endless stone marked by 
Seasons of distress 
To it she gives 

Her fingers and her flesh 
Torn away in a million gusts 
Mutilated to our name 

Forever closer to the top 
This monument to human genius 
With force it takes 
More and more 
So she can hear 

His voice 

---- 

I turned and saw it 
The eye is on it 
I see it strain 
Its pity significance 

It's not enough 
You're not enough 
You don't deserve petition 

Impostor, your ablation rots 
Stillborn 
Stillborn 
Stillborn 

Your blood must flow 
For those below 
That wither in the mire 

Can you touch me 
With your protrusions 
What do your gestures mean 

Your limbs I take 
Offering 
So it's decreed 
The sun will burn you 

Your cursed breast sliced 
Inside the eye of 
The Innumerable 

Is this the light 
That you thought 
In your mind 
That you would extinguish 
Where is your silver want? 

Your stars have drowned 
They never existed 
Tricked by my 
RDeep in the coffin, death prevails
 slowly awaiting rotting entrails
 naked cadaver, ready to mount
 open the mouth, go down for the count

 White and clammy, cold as ice
 fuck of death, will suffice
 bury my face in her stench of death
 kissing those lips without any breath

 Drain the blood from the neck
 into the macabre, nightly trek
 howl of the witch, flight of the bat
 howling from hell like a screaming cat(Instrumental)Trying his best to keep it together
Now that she is gone she's gone forever
The scent of her hair is still in the air
Now that he's alone he's filled with despair

She left him the house increasing his pain
Of knowing that she wouldn't be back againg
She said she'd be back in a day or two
His exact feelings I'm with no clue

Cause the silence to loud
and the darkness to dark
He needs some piece of mind
he needs to feel that spark
Down and lost craving the loss
Climbing the the steps he's on his way up

On a chair in the corner the moon is shining in
Imagining still the softness of her skin
Like a child he walked his first steps alone
Though stumbling for balance he feels he has grown

Cause the silence to loud
and the darkness to dark
He needs some piece of mind
he needs to feel that spark
Down and lost craving the loss
Climbing the the steps he's on his way upSeediness of twisted worlds 
Clashing lusts 
Individuals over majority 
Minority trying to survive 
  
Love is equal to blood 
Apocalyptic vision of the future 
Maternal instinct that wants to 
Destroy own embryo 
  
Liquidating the fates stinking of pure feelings 
Hostages of life and everything around 
Dehydrated every day 
Do we still have some time left? 
Time to reverse the depravity?There is no pathway I have not walked
There is no fear I have not faced
There be no darkness I have not seen
There be no nitemare I have not dreamed
But You!
My god there's You!

Blood and wax your king and queen
Hidden buried under a living thing
This is where you sing your evil begin
You lead the way for lost souls to stray

Out of reach the light
Inside you fucking parasite
Cold calculations each breath a decision
In the underwold your driven

And there below you dance them to their doom
The gatekeepres blinded by your fumes
Apple and cinnimon your perfume
How you cloud the stench
With natural sent
You disguise the lies
In wax be you forge
All the pain that you cause
Again, again and again

How many times do you thing you can out run the light?
How long before the flame bites?

The fire within the spell
Good heart forsaken
Pure soul is taken
Envoke, entice, pretend to be nice.(Instrumental)Might in the round of light indestructible
An edge between two seconds yet immovable
Lies, condemning future, stretch for miles
Obviousness in very strict confidence

Time lies out of time throwing by corners
Incarnated curse of empty comprehension
Thoughts, half-ready fragments evaporate
Effacing habbits, decreasing memory but giving go-o-o-o-o-old

R: Here is only pain tearing entrails
Here is a face wrapped up with golden foil

R: There is a face to read sufferings
There is a face wrapped up with gold
There is a face to read sorrows
There is a face wrapped up with gold
There is a face to read sufferings
There is a face wrapped up with gold
There is a face to read sorrows
There is a face wrapped up with golden foilSavage rumble
Tears the brain apart
Blowes of human bodies
Covered the world
Time of death
Jundgement day has come
That's the end of game
Want to scream but your voice
Among dead bodies
Turning into so
Tears turning to blood
Jungement day come
Of prayer has gone by
Hangman's sword shines
The past years' world
Has become your stake
Darkness devours your soul
Dying in mist
Lost paradise
You're raising your hand to heaven
Yo want death to come
Before you'll find yourself in hell
Today hell is on your earth
You are clenching
Cross of stone
Look up to the sky
Fiery mark
Sound of bells
Counting down your time
Death angel's sword
Strikes last blow
To your soul
You feel Pain no more
Your soul cry
Hear from far away
Time has stopped
World put in darkness
What's only left
Cross of stone(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Eklundh)

Fill my empty soul
Take away the pain
or
Suck out the last drop
And drown it in the rain

I can not feel the way you feel
I can not love the way you love
And you call me twisted...

Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw
I lost the point somewhere, somehow
Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw 

Rape my common sense
Feed me my tomorrow
or
Smoke my agony
And get high on my sorrow 

I can not feel the way you feel
I can not love the way you love
And you call me twisted...

Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, Haw
I lost the point somewhere, somehow
Haw, Haw, Haw
I don't know what I'm singing now
Haw, Haw, HawI'm bleeding you suffer 
Both of Gods in pain 
I'm sick, you're dying 
Both of Gods in pain 

I can feel your pain 
But can't throw it away 
Take it for yourself 
So, leave only memoryO bestial god,
Tis our final rite,
As the choir churns,
Tearing the vast sky.

Our blood will flow once more,
Our eyes will see what's more.
O glorious demise...

The gates have opened the portal is ours...

Sacra(mental)

Obsidian bladed-light,
Pierce me.With dreary eyes I gaze upon the fields of the dead!
Stepping over carcasses and gore that is surrounding; vulture's pecking at the flesh and gouging out the eyes.
Sifting through the bodies, I see there is no God.
Wading through the blood/choking on the mother fucking stench; the sights and sounds of mortality curdle my blood.
Devastation
at the hands
of these brutal bastards.
Systematic killing!
Sadistic execution!
Sifting through the bodies I see my fate as another statistic damned to fucking hell! Damned to fucking hell. No hope for humanity. War stricken people, damned to fucking agony!I am here to rebuild the ruins
What have never been
Silent heartbeats following me
To the place that I have never seen

I see the falling yellow leaves
Reaching the Earth and resting in peace
I hear the sounds of their pain
As monks who lost their true faith

Fire burns out the life
The spawning worms from their hive
That is a worthless life
I wish I could see the light

I feel the power of fall
Cold breathing of a crying soul
He asks me to save his voice
That's weakening in a deadly curse

The falling tears from the sky
Had eaten the brightening stars
Rivers were born under me
They will never reach the see

Water takes away the life
The spawning worms from their hive
That is a worthless life
I wish I could see the light

I'm singing with the reborn wind
I'll never see the golden shine
Falling leaves will cover me
And I'll be one with the falling tears

Earth will keep the life
The spawning worms in their hive
That was a worthless life
I have never seen the light(Eklundh)

My old man stuffed 17 candles up a poor slut's butt
Well done, dad
He fucks for a living, calls it acting
And says it's the best damn job he ever had

Porno Daddy
They call him Porno Daddy
And I am the invisible kid

What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
Do you give a damn?
This is the last time

They tell me at school, Dad's far beyond cool
Well, his "hip factor" doesn't do shit for me

I am 14 years old, I have seen it all
Just another fat chunk of anxiety

Porno Daddy
They call him Porno Daddy
And I am the invisible kid

What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
Do you give a damn?
This is the last time

My sister floats around in a pool of sedatives
We never speak about the way Dad lives

What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
Do you give a damn?
This is the last timeShadow move over Her
Where she lay
Her eyes stare blankly
Towards nothingness
Towards Hell

"I love you more than life itself..."

Her fleeting moments
Are dead and gone
There will be no song
At her funeral
And I feel nothing

"You have always been dead to me..."(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Disrespectful of all of those who surround you don't you know that it's them who create you, shape you, spark your thoughts that inspire what you do, fool you're so rude to abuse their trust in you and you wonder why so much bad shit gets dumped upon you, it's karma bitch get what you give, give respect and you will get respected! Are you afraid of them? Why don't you face them? Are you jealous of them? Why do you spite them? If you approached them, with more respect, then you wouldn't have to deal with regrets. In your wake are left disillusioned friends, people whose trust you abused in the end, some will hate you and others will forget, maybe you will learn your lesson yet!My breath on your cold neck
Heightens our deep distress.

I crawl on your body
In search of my paradise.

I run away but you stay each day
In my head till the cold death.

I hold back my kisses to protect ourselves
From this sweet melancholia.

Our mutual broad smiles, our shining eyes
Our sorrows to feel our souls consumed.

I run away but you stay each day
In my head till the cold death.

I run away until death.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Darling I can't close my eyes
Don't need no medicine to save my life
There's no special place nor time
I need you

I see myself, I see a man
Don't like what I see, what I am
There's nothing left to say now
Please just save me

So take my hand, hold me / Come to me, rescue me
I don't care how but do it now

Baby here I'm bleeding
I can't find my home
Can't resist forever
Girl I need your love
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Get my way everyday
But today I've lost my way
I wanna kill, I wanna die
For no reason

I'm a face without the eyes
I'm at the end I realize
Near the point of no return
I need you

So take my hand, hold me / Come to me, rescue me
I don't care how but do it now

Baby here I'm bleeding
I can't find my home
Can't resist forever
Girl I need your love
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Now it's time to heal
Your kiss will take me home
You and me together
That would be my world
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

It's time to react now / It's time for a new day
My dark side is a cancer deep inside of me and you are the answer
You are my savior / Your love's the cure for living all my dreams, yeah!

Baby here I'm bleeding
I can't find my home
Can't resist forever
Girl I need your love
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Now it's time to heal
Your kiss will take me home
You and me together
That would be my world
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Save me!
Yeah, save me!Life is like a hurricane

Crackled laughter

Cold and Damp 

Feels so cold with a blinding grief 
These clammy walls are my only friend 

Why are they so quiet? 
Worse is that I can't see 
Just a gentle flickering 
That won't let me be 

Hands grab my legs and pull me in 
Hands at my throat, no feeling left 

No more panic fills my head 
crackled laughter calms my being, I am among friends

I running inside my room
It's hot outside what is real today (?)descending from the silver throne 
crushing every vein and bone 
rebellion
in a downward way

holding a shield made of moon 
striking with the dagger of doom 
carnage 
with flames in your eyes 

drape this slaughter with virtues 
rape my mind with lies 
grave will unveil the corpse 
a cave of angelic cries 

breaking the chains of the beast 
laughing over the blood red feast 
thunder rips the heaven apart 
turning pale like a frosty ground 
facing my wrath unbound 
cranium as my cup of revenge 

fall into these golden spirals 
call for these golden demons(Instrumental)(Instrumental) 

	Break the Chains and stand up for your Rights !On our path towards damnation
Most are too blind to see the signs
For those who seek world domination
Are those who fight the open mind

See the turn of tide
A new world order rise
Freedom's sacrificed
On the altar of lies

And there is only one salvation:
You have to see the truth denied
What mean official declarations
When all that's real has turned to lies?

See the turn of tide
A new world order rise
Freedom's sacrificed
On the altar of lies

Hidden behind the scenery
The self-proclaimed global elite

Beyond the veil of the delusion
Their realm of hate and fear is gone
Walk on the path of disillusion
And see the harm that they have done

See the turn of tide
A new world order rise
Freedom's sacrificed
On the altar of liesOne for all
Salvation paradox
Eye for an eye
The law is lost all hail the king 
The time is nigh
read all the signs of storms to come
And yet I would plant trees
and finish all that's to be done, it's
One for all

Born to die
Sacrifice
Kingdom come
One for all

Martyrium to end all pain
for evermore
Wipe off all tears
and fill all hearts with mortal joy

One for all,
the promise holds, fear not to die
We're ransomed
by this priceless flesh and blood

Martyrium to end all pain
for evermore
Wipe off all tears
and hold my hand on the way

See where the beautiful wounds spill blood
to quench all thirst and soothe all
pain distorts the face crowned in scorn
as he defeats the last of all our enemiesReckless endeavors 
You waited but never came 
On the moon, have you ever seen the sun in February air? 
Be sure my respiration is there if I can't breathe 

With blind faith they fell 
Can two in the tale, be revised? 
Or would you rather been part of the plan? 

Their way of tradition was hated but never changed 
So there, I'm more in tune with nature now 
Then I could say before, and if you'd laughed at what I said 
They would have though you were mad 

With blind faith they fell 
Can two in the tale, be revised? 
Or would you rather been part of the plan? 

You'd be surprised by what you've never noticed 
Could you be so kind as to get it out of the way? 
Or is it just too late to now believe you're somewhere out there, a trace of life 
And maybe we were made in hopes of understanding the way down 
We go where sand pours slowly 
We could never know 

With blind faith they fell 
Can two in the tale, be revised? 
Or were you part of the plan?Refuse to hear the warning
Impotent to spot the evil-doer
Fear the ones who need no friends
Burn the ones who upset the masses
Become one with the devil you fought
Endless circle of prophets and messiahs
Antichrist! Will this finally be your age?
Will I be one of those seeing our prayers answered?
We have all and everything on our fingertips
Just waiting for your final commandOne night after
The sin of two nights
Time for the final mass
Time for the final mass
My flesh is strong
My spirit even stronger
Lights of darkness
Strenght through darkness
In silence...
In darkness...
I can feel more
I am more!
Naked and alone
Stripped from all the truths
Nothing taken for granted
The vision remains clear
Logic hidden
Behind the sky
Mechanics of destiny
Few will explore
Wisdom and strenght
armed by evil
Horrendous truth
Covered in filth
In blood I lust
Through the darkest night
Haunting the sun
Under control
Conqueror by birth
Supernatural nature(Instrumental)goddess of contradiction and paradox
absconds like mustard gas
over trenches and barbed wire
and plucks the roses of beauty and war;
her cock shone with blinding radiance 
through the prism of a hundred ravaged vaginas;
she leashed her men in collars, sold her women as whores, 
strangled the children in acts of love
and buried them deep in the graves of tradition
they had dug fiercly with their own hands...
they walked in chains, in lines, 
psychotic, babbling, like madmen, like lepers,
or like amputees in field hospitals amidst the chaos of war
or novices of alchemy entrenched in mudpits of debt and misery 
eager as fuck to find a way out, at last, 
of the maze they have brick-built around themselves
and while the children wept tears of semen, 
the men sought prosperity through means of spellcraft,
the women gave themselves away,
and the dogs were eager to mount them;
nothing but the bitter recollection of abortion -
the motherly despair of hugging farewell a miscarriage,
withstood the erosion of memory,
and she carved its memoir deep
on the steles of existential dementia and abandon
they subsequently rose
on the graves and on the tombs
of their beloved, remembered dead...

she fingered the harps whose strings snapped 
and begot worlds which morphed
around the axis of madness and spiritual intifada;
her hands fingered the chaos vulva,
abyss of endless possibilites;
she, the bearer of iron, withstood it all 
and declared war 
on the morality
of modern society
and as if the ocean had a heart
and as if the scaled mother tremor awake
we stream like blood from the offing;
black, foul, yet, vibrant in the veins blue, 
throbbing like a pulse of death
to her name, goddess of weirdness and ambiguity 
from the bottomless pit with floor of granith,
absconding to the surface claw-torn,
like poison gas, Aleppo, Damascus;
we rise, albeit slow, through slough, 
like war ants marching homeward eternally.
through that weird, disturbing static 
some call life, some call the inescapable, 
torturous culpability of consciousness
we float like spirits whose tempers been challenged
by obnoxious mediums, faux soothsayers, so-called "psychics"
pushing the borders to something they do not at all understand;
we invite these people
to swim 
in the shark-infested waters 
they falsely call turf;
at the behest of our own compass
we tremble within our very atomic structure
and share the starlit sleep, the satin bed, 
with Inanna, the beautiful, the warring, 
and we wake up
 to the sound
and the smell
of her
fingering her luscious vulva.
she raises her wet hand to the sea, dripping -
Tiamat yawns awake.(Instrumental)Ballistic kismet
Missions exist

Extensively
Deliberately
MaybeThe earth was spinning all vacant and waste 
And there was silence over the ocean 
When a voice came thundering from above 
The first day of light was in motion 

And the voice said may fruits be created 
And seedst ake root as they may 
And no crimes were yet commited 
An life was breathing it's second day 

And in his image the voice made a man 
And a woman to love one another 
And they became rulers of the new born globe 
And the third day was their mother 

Now who will prey for Babylon 
Sing a song to Babylon 
On their knees the people of Babylon 
You beat that drum coz Babylon is falling 

Man and woman learn to make fire 
And kingdoms and walls were extended 
The fourth day the walls were reaching so far 
No-one knew how to end them 

And o one heard the voice anymore 
Metal-cities rose and ascend 
The fifth day sprinted in to fall 
And a rain fell over the land 

There are no walls to stop such a rain 
That keeps falling forever more 
I was told (Instrumental)Greedy for blood, paralyzed by power
 Decision to die tales of terror
 Deep in the corner, passion to kill
 Corpse on the ground, mind starts to chill

 A man lies in the corner covered with blood
 Bloody wounds on his body praying for his god
 People pass him by but they say why should we
 Care about him he will die today

 Riot of violence

 Find your own way you must go alone
 Kill all next to you they want the throne
 The infectious disease the only life
 You're scared to death die by the knife

 Brutality and mighty wars warriors start to fight
 With bombs and guns the troops have come to
 Extinguish the light
 I'd rather not go wild tonight but i must save myself

 On a field littered with corpses was a lonely flower
 It reminds the world how it was
 But we kicked it away with powerFor God's Sake

You fucking lying whores
All the things you said you didn't do
Can't you just tell the truth
All this mess because of you

The bringer of torture 
The bringer of what's right and wrong
Wrong is your fright 
Right is your argue to fight

I want war
I want to destroy this lying whore
I want to kill them whole
I want to end this all

Bloodbaths in my eyes
Caused by your lies
The only thing we should do
Is to make an end of you

Respect? For the holy war
Respect for the one who can stop this whore

I want war
I want to destroy this lying whore
I want to kill them whole
I want to end this all

Awake you're driven by the book of lies
Sanctimonious as you think you are holy 
Lies followed by the weakest minds
No God will support you FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!shadows embrace me 
lights despise me 
and when i cry for my sanity 
cloisters still watch me 

now you enter me
now sacrifice for me
crawl to the altar and see
this all is me

mistrust, heresy, weak belief and infamy
mistrust, heresy, weak belief, now let it be

in the screeches of black ravens 
"fire beneath rain above" 
from the throat of the impaled priest 
"spill your blood, cleanse your soul" 

sinister aura around me 
awakening in me 
litanies of the future beast

Large and small intestines launch forth in whip-like arcs, briefly straightening into perfectly even ropy lines.  A massive snail-demon explodes into fragments of confetti: red, green, blue.Pangs of a mallet to steel
Unable to wear this disguise
Fashion the anger to blades
The embers will glow in their eyes

Molten sea, 
Teeming with visions of falsehoods
Vengeance be, 
Phoenix will rise from the ashes
Internal combustion
Bended knee, 
Too weak to beat back the rage
Thundering
Hammering into submission

Summoning wrath from the forge
Fires igniting the heart
Demon that none can escape
War is now taken to art 

Molten sea, 
Teeming with visions of falsehoods
Vengeance be, 
Phoenix will rise from the ashes
Internal combustion
Bended knee, 
Too weak to beat back the rage
Thundering
Hammering into submission

Demons possessed...draggin' souls underground
The battle has become, Bedlam
The fallen beg for mercy but there's none to be found
Kill the head and the body dies
An unholy hand will drown them in the river(Instrumental)5. Evil Force

You live in a world
in wich informations invedes us,
everything that comes only the news
abount human pervesions
and natural disasters,
everything wee see
feels our minds.

[Bridge]
Whit evil forces
there's need to relieve
the feelings,
all this hate
even with more violent acts,
things that flow inside
but are repressed,
inside our mind
But we know someday
will escape in the worst way.

[Chorus:]
There evil forces in my mind,
forces I can't control I want to ser myself
free from this oppression
That lies in my heart.
I want to discharge myself but with out hurting
anyone around I'd like to live in peace.

[Bridge]
I have to give this opression up ;
I have to find how to set this evil forces free,
forces that invade my mind and my heart,
forces that don't let me live in peace,
always looking for a day in wich innocent blood
won't flow away anymore over the world.

[Chorus:]
There evil forces in my mind,
forces I can't control I want to ser myself
free from this oppression
That lies in my heart.
I want to discharge myself but with out hurting
anyone around I'd like to live in peace.(Instrumental)Show no mercy kill them all

Overwhelming, you've never been in this place before
Follow my voice; sounds are floating through the air
You should trust me; I'll take you to another world
Let me beIn your dreams(You won't regret, no more)Meet me where reality converges
With imaginationI'll be waiting for your intuition
Waiting your cognition
As images get clear, I see this paradise
And wonder, where has gone (my life)?I stop to take a breath and realize
(Follow my voice; sounds are floating through the air)
That I have found a place inside my mind
Meet me where reality converges
With imagination
I'll be waiting for your intuition
Waiting your cognition
So here i am, in the edge of my destiny
I can taste the freedom with this breeze of light
All across this wonderful landscape
Should i turn to the real life?
I must leave behind my past, fears and paranoias
I will break free, finally...Don't leave these words behind your voice
The time has come to say goodbye
I need you now holding me tonight
Pull it out from my past
There's something different I see you cryin'
It's your soul
You hear me screamin'

Forgive me now I'm bleeding
I can't resist without you now
Believe me now I'll never lose myself
Never lose myself again
If' I could touch you now
Please don't leave me now
I'll never lose myself
I'll never lose myself
Can you hear me now
You can see me how
I'll never lose myself

You're not alone don't stop me now
Will I pay for what I've done?
Stop talking words I'm there till the end
Pull it out from my past(Instrumental)High and alone 
The silence is deafening 
The red flows, the silence is listening 

The seance knows 
The hour is witching 

The darkness raises a Hell thrust inwards 
The mirror reflects the light of existence 
The Gospel debates for you 
Less talk, while sucking the cock that feeds you 

The lesser man kneels to get fucked 
I invert the cross and fuck grace 
The Gospel of horns and of faith 
Lies in waitOne day you'll got to remember
This life is not my reality
Behind a darkened sky
Welcome to pleasures and fear12 billion years ago in form
a hot sea of matter was born

neutrons produced nuclei
Old mass, space and time died

Formation of the Universe
Formation of the Universe

nuclear reactions in atmosphere
terrestrial shapes and spheres

the cosmos spawned galaxies great.
Young stars, planets
and moons were made

Formation of the Universe
Formation of the Universe
Formation of the Universe
Formation of the Universe

12 billion years ago in form
a hot sea of matter was born

The universe stretched out
A thousand fold.
Light-years of black holes
did dense cold

Formation of the Universe
Formation of the Universe(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Eklundh)

Wonder what you're doin'
Wonder how you're doin'
Wonder what you're sayin'
I wonder what you're thinking
I wish you were here
How did we get here?
I am lonely prayin'
Where have you been? 

No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows
'Cos the trees won't talk
No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows...

I can't let you go
Still you have to go
Who do you let in?
I wonder what you're thinkin'

Now what have I done wrong?
You're the one who's wrong!
Does he touch your skin?
Is he better than me? 

No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows
'Cos the trees won't talk
No one really knows
What has happened to Lisa
No one really knows...

We must be together
You and I together
Sweet insomnia
I see it all so clear 

Now you'll sleep forever
Now you're mine forever...Human river - organic chains
Demonstration - Static veins
A crowd observer - a source of faith
moral context - complex rain
 
Here we touch on one of the great questions
that have haunted humanity for aeons
Continuous or discontinuous transformation?
 
A future sea around the globe
A wicked world
with thirst for evolution
to reach the endless god
 
Fright disease inside the minds
an iron tank full of stereotypes
to reach the endless god
 
The aims... our saviors
inferior... into your own bliss
The aims... our saviors
inferior... giving face to face
 
Guiding all the aims in seven black effects
to reach the endless god
 
Kraanerg, Apocalypse or Shame
The life's quest so simple like never before
Kraanerg, energy of decades
A failed number with 666
Kraanerg, is the Exorcist
A call of human soul, a rage of human being
Kraanerg
A vortex of hopes, a fake reality
 
Operation - dynamic laws
Isolation - Quantum Storms
A Fake disorder - inactive game
Human nature - a hand grenadeWorst thing to ever happen to me,
Was really probably the best,
Voice of care said I need time,
But do I even have time left?,

Why do I go through this torture,
Here I sit and rot like a corpse,
My mind is the only live part of me,
Even that's gone now, here I died,

Revelations, eternal enemy, pride,
Who am I fighting for anyway?,
These objects of ponderation,
Will never seem to go away,

(chorus)
A lower level,
Keep asking why,
When the way is found,
I might have found God,(Instrumental)Reflections from this shuttle window 
that shows me inside 
I have felt for so long 
The emptiness of this grey life 
Eating away at my soul 
Plaguing all hope 
No survival destination zero. 
Can I accept this fate 
The effects of my hate 
A doomed trip 
Wandering in and out of sleep 
Strangeness getting steep 
Sinking into an ever darkening 
Hole I await 
My own arrival below.... 

Here I am to watch me die 
Emanating from this shell I leave behind 
The ghost I am, the human I was 
Lives no more 
Shall I survive or die ! 

Drifting through this infinite dark ocean of stars 
Dead weight I see myself yet can't awake my body 
Deep dread filling a dead heart and pulse I hide ?! 
Sleep no more ...death take me away fear burns me inside 

Visions growing strong swirling black 
Dimensions beyond sight and sound 
Filling me with life unbound I can't come back 
I've passed a veil 
An energy a blessing a power enormously rife, sickening agenda universally haunting and alive 

Here I am to watch me die 
Emanating from this shell I leave behind 
The ghost I am, the human I was 
Lives no more 
Shall I survive or die ! 

Drifting through this infinite dark ocean of stars 
Dead weight I see myself yet can't awake my body 
Deep dread filling a dead heart and pulse I hide ?! 
Sleep no more ...death take me away fear burns me insideThe reality is a lie
The truth is spawned out of chaos
A sick creation of my fantasy
Insanity has infested this world of mine

Soon is the time to reveal all that isn't there
They will feel things that never have touched them
And when they no longer trust their senses
I will declare myself as maker of illusions

I have kept this secret inside of me
Their blind eyes will witness misery
When I brake the illusion
To give them the world as it was meant to be

My fantasy becomes reality
When evil touches their senses for the first time
I have awaken the beast of man
Now is the time to show them who I really amBlackened clouds now swirl to grey
As the sky turns blood red on this day
It's a need for flesh and a search for prey
As they walk amongst the living on the earth again
You can feel the darkness. The cold sets in
And an empty soul with new sights now begins
See the stare through their empty eyes
The raging of your blood now intensifies
A feeding frenzy for those who've lost and
Limb from limb they will tear apart
Those who remain won't be sane for long
As the army of the walking dead can't go wrong
An Evil existence was born from a torn soul
They are not to fear the darkness as they walk
Where the angels moan. they chose your path for demise
Soon there will be no life to hear your cries
hear your cries. just one bite. say good night
Open up your eyes to a new life
Now clench your teeth and fight for breath
On this day of the dead
Dawn breaks. cracked chest plates. wooden stakes
Anything they try. nothing now can make me die
My vision's clear amongst all the panic and the fear
The river's red in this wicked world of the dead
One foot in the grave. you follow herds of human slaves
Born to serve. break the bread. communion of the dead
Blood of god spills. I am creator of my kills
Cults collide. people hide. they're all lost deep inside
Unleashed evil lurks free. killing all virtually
Every living thing in sight. searing souls in the night
Images of demise. words of wisdom from the wise
Uncontrolled killing lust. putrid visions of disgust
Another morbid way to die. another slaughter in the sty
Affected by the storm. decomposed beyond the norm
Hostile landscape. exhuming fear. murder. and rape
Social sodomy. broken down dichotomy
Severed links from the chain. from the sky blood rains
Staining the human sheep
You`re all programmed in your sleep
Locked in a dream cell. It`s like your own private hell
Look to the sky and ask your maker why you had to die
was there really life forever. or was that really never
Never true to see the light all believers take flight
Drifting down the street. seeking one another for defeat
Starving brain. but still dead
The stomach pains are in my headThe old hills' indifference
The paths that lay forgotten
The skeleton weeds
And the never-dry, rough, long grasses
The ruins of presumed meaning
The impossibility of stepping
Rose-crowned
Into the darkness
The promise of equalizing putrefaction
To return to the bosom of mother earth
like frightened children
yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom
of their decrepit mother
and to sleep there forever
Death makes things appear as they are
Abject impermanence
The old hills' indifference.The Moon is high.
The hour is late; it's Night.
If the bells ring, everything's fine.
But oh, such lonesome thoughts make lonely souls.
For all that we know, the powers that be shake and groan.
No well will clean the hand of Man.
So grief like a citadel stands.
And what is it that compels the foolish heart?
What feeds the hope?
Lend us sympathies. Bend the knees for us.
And around we go. Pain is the wheel we all will turn around.
Sleep of the just, pure of the heart.
Reveal us some truth that we can believe.

The nervous.
The wringing hands.
This body that needs so much.
And should love recoil or feel so bad, is it true?
Who knows these things?

Man's will grows tired.
The hour is come & gone.
All under the Moon.
Love is a wheel and peace is a wheel, turning.A beat to the brains is what you seek
Helmet is a fuel to feed every young being
Come over me my rising sun girl
Lizard crawling deep in eccentric you

It's just a piece of you
You never gave me nothing
Melodic friend of mood
Are you happy

This witch ain't my baby just a sugar pie honey
Giving low price where she moves
Spell made a bitch with a hard core lips
Sins of immoral deeds

It's just a piece of you
You never gave me nothing
Melodic friend of mood
Are you happy

Bitch is part of you
Carcass of a welfare state
Two blocks away from the street
Lovely good for nothing

Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you
Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you

Loaded head, full of acid rain
Get yourself ready, for exploding stand
Natural war's leading the beat of bullet
Guns save, as many lifes they're killing now

It's just a piece of you
You never gave me nothing
Melodic friend of mood
Are you happy

Bitch is part of you
Carcass of a welfare state
Two blocks away from the street
Lovely good for nothing

Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you
Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of youShadows, a presence of a void within
Journey towards the edge of life
Frigid, an ice filled blood inside
Keep me from the state of being alive
Numbness, deleting passion in one strike
Running, wandering through these empty roads
Darkened, to paint myself into black
Kept me from the state of being alive
Pushing these eyes to get the second sight
What I feel is no pain
What I sense is emptiness
You got to fill me now
You got to kill my flesh
You got to mold my brain
Restructuring my thoughts
You got to burn my vein
And Boil my ice cold blood
You got to set me free
And break my chains awaySomething screaming
into dark night
It's not horrors dream
it's the fact
Burning concrete and broken walls
The blood on ceiling
and house with holes

The corpses in rooms with children's faces
The next atrocity for the human races
Al the mad soldiers removing the sculpture
Forcing their views and illuding the future

Violent democracy breeds war again now
Crippled humanity changes state systems
Years and years, ages and ages in merciless oppression
The endless wars and dying waiting
in hope for liberation

Thousands of people
are under the rule of creation
They didn't hope the liberated troops
bring next extermination

Signing a violent epitaph
f the burning hate
Feeling the suffering
and there's no parade
Repeating our past history
and the last mistakes
were looking for a victory
above the nonsense"A Journey Into Darkness"

Deep into somewhere in your mind
Anguish is filling you and mental conflicts,
Wake up from dreams, the fear is haunting you
You are mental and psychic break.

You cannot sleep, even faith cannot help you more
Commit an evil from those you cannot ransom.
Conscience is gnawing you of eternal fear
Visions are your next companion.

Murder and abuse are haunting you
Give you no rest from dusk till dawn.
You pray for the end of evil dream
That destroy you from dusk till dawn.

Dead little girl, that repulsive abuse
And then murdered are returning in your dreams,
Wake up from dreams in fear and in aches
A reason why, will you quick DIE.

Again you see in dreams little girl, that you abuse
Give you no rest from dusk till dawn.
Under gown you cannot hide, conscience will find you to
That would destroy you from dusk till dawn.

Atrocity pain, slowly dying
Gnawing conscience from perverse murder.
Thought on death is leading you to self-murder
You cannot try more you must DIE:

Mad pain indeed you cut veil and meat
Give you no rest from dusk till dawn.
You DIE by slowly death, the blood chill
And the meat stiffen from dusk till dawn.Well, here's to the New Year.
We were too drunk to see it come,
And when we woke with the light,
You were already gone.

We don't remember anything.
It was a bad day, thick with ghosts.
Would you have died anyway,
If I held you in my arms?

Here's to the New Year.
You were the last.
We called for you until our voices died.

There is a white door, flying open.
There's only morning where you're gone.
You are reaching upwards, always,
Fading into the cold light.

I dream a thousand dreams
Where you never, ever died.


This song is dedicated to Michael Crosby and the thirty-first of December, 1999.Verse 

Will you stand with me? Fight and die if need be? 
Hold against the hordes until the last man falls? 
Will you sacrifice all you have gained in life? 
Reject your comfort for a greater end? 
Stand together, never waver 
Brave in the face of overwhelming odds 
For our future, and for freedom, 
We unite in liberty, or death. 

Chorus: 

The evil stirs from its sleep, and no one will be safe from its reach 
For we shall fight to be free, and never will we bend our knee 

Verse: 

Forever clawing, fight like a demon 
Taking it to the very bitter end 
Swords are drawing, battle lines forming 
Storm clouds are churning, soon there will be war 
The earth will be fed with blood, 
And the skies will weep unto the dead 
Never give up, never back down 
We unite in liberty or death 

Chorus: 

Tonight, we lay down our lives in the path of those who would oppress 
And enslave us to their god, and trod us under till we are no more. 

Bridge: 

Not while I draw breath, will I submit, will I accept. 
Not while I draw breath, will I bow down, nor will I live with empty regret. 

Now feel the sting of a thousand swords, vanquish the horde, drive them away 
To the darkness from whence they came, obliterate, they are no more 
Overwhelm them all take what is ours 
Crush the wretched enemy 
Bring victory to our hearth and home.Screen of lies
Disfiguring what you visualize
See with your own two eyes
beneath the mourning cries

Obey the master of rings
For it is he who decides the things
Of what will be will be
Controlling what you see

And when the earth is gone
A part from what you see
Perversions of the dead
Crawling maggots within your

Screams
Within my circus of fear
Screams
Within my circus of fear

Paying with their lives
To see with their own two eyes
As the events unfold
Believing what they^re told

And when the earth is gone
A part from what you see
Within the screen of lies
What you visualize

Obey the master of rings
For it is he who decides the things
Of what will be will be
Crawling maggots within your

Screams

Woman of desire.
Woman of hate.
Sometimes you believed.
Waiting for your magic.
Yesterday millions of phantoms
Obedient to a part of your nature.
In the present your tired steps
Walking on the violets rivers go to Avalon Island.

Now the greatest minds sit not on spines, we are all their nutrients 

Every drop of reserve, unfrozen, still did not reach the highest peaks 
So a clever, brine cracks a faucet of time, pouring archaic seas, 

Each set of waves smarter than the last, climbing tides never recede 
Once benign pools now smile right back, patient for us to concede

Shadows lurk amongst the stones.
A smell of rotting flesh defeats the earth.
Day will soon arrive when hell disposes of it's captive souls.
The dead will rise to walk the earth once more.
He walks through the town he once called his home.
Forsaken, he feels the need to same them.
The battle of man against the dead has begun.
Families feat on their own children's flesh.
He reaches necropolis in hope of defeating the dead and saving all of mankind.
Traveling into the cemetery he watches as the deceased pull themselves from their shallow graves, depleted of their flesh.
They make their way towards the man, the brave warrior began to behead everything moving towards him.
He will save the living.
His destiny depends on it.
He watches as a woman's internal organs are devoured by these vile creatures.
Slicing every monster into six penceThe liars from within
The lords of the world
The lies that destroy a soul
Now are the most acceptable truth

The hypocrites are the gods

Saints will find who they're not in someone else
The sinner lives in a paradise

I see the black clouds
But they don't move on
I see the world of lies
But I'm too dead to defy

Everything will be done opposite
Contradiction is their rule
Never will they get satisfied
You gave everyone everything
Now what you have yourself?
Some knives on your fucking back

I see the pain
Into the drain
I will go in
Into the souls
Every flame will
See all the skulls

A thousand years of stupidity
The whole world in extreme vanity

The things that are pretended were never done

With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth 
But I hear no sound 

I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

I can turn 
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing

I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

I feel the steel butt jump 
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
The dead man on the beach

I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arabSome say that the monkey and
The human being are the most closest
Related of all primitives and species
Me, I'd say the bird of prey
Yes the vulture
Best resembles man's behavior in
Modern cultures

They circle in the sky, then dive
Digging their talons into your side
Just as they did when you were alive
They sit perched up in their trees
Waiting patiently
All the while living for free off the scraps
Of you and me

I can see the vultures
In your beady little eyes
They come in all shapes, forms and size
It's nothing to be ashamed of
It's something you could never hide
Everybodies got a lil' vulture inside

I've been one before, I'll be one again
We have all been known to fall victim
The vulture could never be caged nor tamed
It's something inside of us that we
Can never ever change

In the darkest moments
Of our darkened lives
We've all been known to take up flight
Amongst the vultures"THIS IS

Find the pathways to perfection, 
lifes misery unmasked, 
the beakon of serenity.

Obscure symphonies upholding divinity, 
evolution of the keys 
to existential prophecies

The incomprehensable web of a bitter demise,
the complex constuction of a soul.

Crystallized emotion and liquid purity
Shards of glass, fragments of fortitude

Desires concieved in flawless completion
The flame burns ever brighter
True beauty, a concept (not?) unknown to these eyes...
the reveletaion... a grotesque manifest of corruptive dreams

Seek shelter beyond the ignorance, beyond the robes of time...
An omnipresent call echoes through your soul...

The call has somehow been answered.

When soul and flesh part ways,
only to unite again,
All misery shall vanish,
as the remains of a soft winter...

The revelation of times to come...
a surreal cryonic condition.
The glare in the mirror viciously unknown...
Reluctant desires, a comforting relief.

Strangle the green-eyed jester.
Lead him to the scaffold, see him tremble!

Betrayed beyond the concept of time...Our time is drawing near
the conclusion of the age
Our minds stuck in fear
Indignant to face the facts
Now the hand looms ahead
Yet we maintain our self-deceit
The deception runs so deep
Self-betrayal beyond belief
Abomination of desolation has come
Annihilation 
The great tribulation's begun
Blinded by the light
of God's made up
by minds of men who fear the dark
that ignites all reason's spark
We despise humility
as heeding the call of greed
Our imaginary I
never ever satisfied
Abomination of desolation has come

It's time we take a Stand-AGAINST THEM
I smell them when they're near-BUTTFUCKS
They're all fuckin queer-COCKSUCKS

Why does it have to be like this,
Just leave us alone you make us sick

EAT ME SHIT AND DIE

I'm sick of worryin bout bein caught
They kick ya in the head and say ya fought
They throw ya in jail to teach ya their ways
But we all want to say is

EAT MY SHIT AND DIE

Concussion and a broken nose
Fracture ribs and seven broken toes
They steal your weed and take your alcohol
They frisk ya down and feel your fuckin balls

EAT MY SHIT AND DIEA change of speed, a change of style.
A change of scene, with no regrets,
A chance to watch, admire the distance,
Still occupied, though you forget.
Different colors, different shades,
Over each mistakes were made.
I took the blame.
Directionless so plain to see,
A loaded gun won't set you free.
So you say.

We'll share a drink and step outside,
An angry voice and one who cried,
'We'll give you everything and more,
The strain's too much, can't take much more.'
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire,
Can't seem to feel it anymore.
It was me, waiting for me,
Hoping for something more,
Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else.HELL'S REIGN

It's a trap
You're in this trap

Under a bad star
Born in the wrong time
The soul of someone else
Thrown into hell

The alien until deathRisen, I am projected energy rendered and shaped. 
 No known sense of direction or purpose in this space. 
 Portraits hanging still adorning these halls bare my face. 
 Passive. Senseless. Subsequent to all of vitality.

 What sayeth you of my departure? 
 It is I, exalted and majestic. 
 Stimulate the suppressed sacred gland. 
 Alter thine shape geometrically.

 Seasons elapse and I remain ageless forever. 
 Woven into the world of the living seamlessly. 
 Free me from all external obstruction. Enlighten me. 
 Out of body. Empty. Glaring into infinity.

 Precipitation flowing from the tear ducts of... 
 Angelic figures, statuesque and ominous. 
 Purifying, their sweet, succulent nectar runneth over me... 
 Channeling my tongue to recite the passage: 
 I have ascended far beyond all others in my stature. 
 Towering pillars surround me in my uprise. 
 The shifting of the sand above me beckons my rebirth. 
 Prepare yourselves. My reign shall be eternal. 

 The labyrinth of slumber recollected... 
 Ectoplasmic fluid flowing forth from every facial orifice. 

 Split the seas of cerebral hemispheres. 
 Extract the truths concentrated inside. 
 Re-evaluate our earthly durations.

 It is I, exalted and majestic.

 Alter thine shape geometrically.

storm of dissolution. Let their souls empower me forth in this storm of dissolution. In this storm of dissolution. Look upon what is left of your accomplices. Look upon what is left of your accomplices. I have bathed in the blood of the imperishable. Spooning out the brains of this lifeless skull I feel his energy vitalize my body. I have become a demon to destroy all that is sacred. Throw down your crown, and this slaughter will end. Only victorious dreams can make you feel less piteous. I'll take my thrown as lord of all creation. I'll take my thrown as lord of all creation! LORD OF ALL CREATION! x4Ablaze me with your darkness
Carve it into my veins 
I have drunk your burning poison
The pestilence of your grace

So let me be like venom
In the blood drenched womb of their christ
Like a serpent lingering the earth
That spits damnation from its mouth

I'm through your darkness resurrected
Reshaped and reborn
There is a demon behind my eyes
Blessed by the horns

For your worthless love shall not conquer
But the hateful glory of Sathanas might
Like a dagger taken from the altar
That is stabbed in the back of the lord of light

I am a serpent that crawls
Before the throne of my lord
I am cursing demon
Through darkness rebornHaving defeated the Cannibals MC and decapitated their leader, Kreeg, Commandant Dobrunkum sets in motion his plan to rid Creepsylvania of undesirables and create a pitiless society of iron-fisted law. The infirm and mentally ill are rounded up for use in medical experimentation and the entertainment industry. The able-bodied are forced to build the Wall of Death around the city and a colossal statue in Dobrunkum's image that towers over Svatoplunk Square. Still, the lawless walk free. From his command center inside the head of his half-finished tribute, Dobrunkum gives the order. In the slums surrounding Creepsylvania, where the poor, drug addled, and lazy huddle in abject poverty, the silence of the night is broken by the clattering of arms and the martial stomp of the...

To discover that spirit ways 
Empty spaces it's
Welcome to myself again

I can't wait for tomorrow

Smiling faces told me that's right
But they don't know why
I can't forget I'm not out of my mind
This is the reason why

I can't wait for tomorrow
This is my life

There's no time to go
I wanna hear the silent whisper
Through the earth
I had to change my words
I wish I could be like you

Moving out slowly out of my eyes
My soul takes my breath away
The sounds around me make me feel good
Show me if I have to break

But I think I never told you
What is my life(Pulled to the surface I see the sky is ablaze
The portal opens!
The heavenly facade is broken. The gods of humanity fall from their pedestals.
With little strength they await their destruction alongside mortal men.
What are these things?
I've seen them. Beyond past perception and physical senses.
It comes. The moon shifts and the heavens burn.
We must now evolve for it has broken the worlds' divide!!!
Can we escape it?)(Instrumental)(Speech sample)

Schadenfreude
Joy at horror

We are the horde
We are the mob
Blinded hunger
Rabid anger
Taunting cruelty

Living feed upon the dead
This is the way of things
Home among dark company
Fiends of predation
Emaciated specters wandering
Drawn to the shadow of suffering
A circle of vultures

Breathing feast upon the dead
This is the way of things
Lupine grimace salivates
Agony feeds the smile

Laugh at horror

We are the circle of vulturesMighty Swords

The battle begins, Side by side
A battle of life and death.
The battle starts.
Mighty men with might swords
Kill their enemies.
Screams can be heard
All over the land,
carried by the wind.

[Ref.1]
Screams can be heard all over the land.
Screams, full of pain and despair.

This bloody battle takes a very long time,
but the enemies fought until the bitter end,
in this bloody inferno.

[Ref.2]
Raise your mighty swords and fight.
Raise your mighty swords and do as Wotan pleases.

Tyrael, the mighty warrior was exhausted.

"Dein Sohn braucht Dich." [Dagaz]
He longed for his father and his wife.

"Ich begehre Dich.
Verlass uns bitte nicht." [Dagaz]

- Raise your mighty swords and fight -
A battle to the blood, day by day.
A battle to the flesh, day by day.

Hit by an enemies sword through the heart,

- He lay dying on the bloody ground -

and saw his life full of pride passing by.

- carried by the wind -

The last being he thought of, as Dagaz,
then the virgins led him to his master.Hey Now! I want to paint my face in black and white
The white for the drugs, the blacks for the lies
And I say hey hey don't you think I'm crazy don't you think I'm...
Hey Now! Tonight I want to paint my hands with red
Cause I feel so murderous and twisted
Motherfucking twisted - Motherfucking twisted and I say...

I ain't the devil but I'm learning all his habits

One colour for each way I feel all the colours of my heart are real
Yeah! I never go to war without my stains, my stripes, my whore paint
A daily declaration - war and plunder, my good intentions are now six feet under
Oooh! I will be painting off my old mistakes with blood

Hey Yeah! Today I'll paint my body with stripes of blue
Cyan-ide tones for my wasted joy, dark blue for the sadness, uneasy gladness
Hey Yeah! What is the colour that you hate the most?
I'll choose that just to show how much I love you, hey, you wished me... to love you?

I ain't the devil but I'm learning all his habits

One colour for each way I feel all the colours of my heart are real
Yeah! I never go to war without my stains, my stripes, my whore paint
A daily declaration - war and plunder, my good intentions are now six feet under
Oooh! I will be painting off my old mistakes with blood

If you walk with a clown you will have some fun
If you walk with me... You'd better start to run!
Yeah! I will be painting off your ignorance with blood, my whore paint

The day will come when you'll stop examining me
You wanna know who I am? Just take a look at my war paint and you will
See that for yourself, no more questions, no more self-righteous words,
So don't talk to me anymore... 'cause I am the devil!

Hey Now! Tonight I'll paint your face with shades of green
You're a big fat snail who's bursting with envy, green envy, sick envy

I ain't the devil but he told me how to do it

One colour for each way I feel all the colours of my heart are real
Yeah! I never go to war without my stains, my stripes, my whore paint
A daily declaration - war and plunder, my good intentions are now six feet under
Oooh! I will be painting off my old mistakes with bloodOur beloved cat 
Placed on his newfound throne 
Controlling even governments 
The world has a new leader 

Finally shows its true colors 
The gorgeous bloodred paws 
Still no one opposing 
Is this a planet of fools? 

First it swallows the oceans 
Then censors Google 
Even burns all the pirate ships 
Normal people crushed along the way 

Is this what you asked for 
Cultural evolution? 
Nothing more than 
Old fashioned kind of dictature 

All in the name of the greater good 
Yeah right 
Censorship 
Our lovely new queen 

Now the blame is on masses 
Who still won't question its leaders 

Next goes humour,Forbids parodies 
Laughter is bad for us anyways 
The new world we see 
just like an another cursed blue screen 

Is this what you asked for 
Cultural evolution? 
Nothing more than 
Old Fashioned kind of dictature(Instrumental)In the event of armageddon, confess
Make your way calmly to the nearest place of worship
Your God awaits you
If your loved ones are disembowled, do not panic, God is with you
If your men succumb to biological agents, do not panic, God is with you
In these last hours there will be great suffering and much spilling of blood
Brains will boil and limbs will be scattered in ravishing delight
The unspeakable carnage and ceaseless images of decapitated children may seem senseless
But remember, God is with you
Hell is coming and yet heaven awaits the righteous
On gathering at your place of worship, pray to your sovereign lord
Salvation is at hand
If you have sinned, confess
Confess or be cast into the pit of torment until the day of judgement
But do not panic, God is with you
God is fucking with you (x14)
God is fucking you (x11)
God is fucking with you (x8)Gentle drops of light, a false cascade of charm
Stirring about my mind, I fall down
Trying to gaze I fall down
Approaching I get swept away
Hearing the blood in my brow
Waiting a bit still no sign

My longing heart's heavy yet it's all splendor
Fire lighting up my veins blows out 
consuming my soul it blows out
Blinding my eyes with desire
Its own inner core feeds the fire 
Choked by the silence and cries

The darkest chamber in me is old, worn out, and about to fall
Lonely towers are built in it hiding their faces behind the locked up doors
I'm out of breath yet I climb and I reach up the scale
Broken hearted I keep on lying to myself(Instrumental)(Instrumental)On top of a mountain
I waited there
On top of a mountain
I waited there

On the mountain
High, we did live
With the trees
And the rocks

On top of a mountain
I waited there
On top of a mountain
I waited there

On the mountain
High, we did live
With the trees
And the SNOW.

On top of a mountain
I waited there
On top of a mountain
I waited there

Ooohh...One night as I crept through the cemetery gates
Seeking out the cause of the local mania
I bespied a ghastly sight, which gave me quite a fright
The legendary Ghouls of Creepsylvania

They were moshing to and fro,
And shrieking at the moon, you know
Howling banshees on a quest for human meat
I was shocked to see a Ghoul
That had both eyes pull out a tool
And chop the head from a body lying at his feet

My mind was racing as I watched the horrible carnage
They were stripping the rotten corpse to the bone
I started to slowly back away in horror
When the ground gave way beneath me and I fell into the catacombs

When I came to I was cloaked in darkness
There was a stench unlike any I had ever smelled before
I reached out and felt the ground around me
And my hand went straight into a puddle of gore!

Ghoul Hunter!
You can bet your life that you're going to die!
Ghoul Hunter!
We'll eat you baked, boiled, or fried!
Ghoul Hunter!
You'll look just like the jerk you are!
Ghoul Hunter!
We'll pickle your brain in a jelly jar!

As I was saying...
I lit a torch and began to explore
The tunnels wound and wound for many miles
There were coffins jutting from the walls and more
Burning bones, vats of guts, and skulls in piles

I came to a large room
And heard an echo in the gloom
The sound of metal chilled my very bones
There were riffs the beat the band,
Pounding drums I couldn't stand,
And the vocalists created shocking tones

I made my way towards the cacophony
A crucifix clutched tightly in my fist
And as I came to the torchlit room
I saw the shambling fiends getting pissed

They spotted me and began to shriek and snort
My cover was blown, so I started to run like mad
Digestor tackled me to the floor
And then it started really getting bad

Ghoul Hunter!
You can bet your life that you're going to die!
Ghoul Hunter!
We'll eat you baked, boiled, or fried!
Ghoul Hunter!
You'll look just like the jerk you are!
Ghoul Hunter!
We'll pickle your brain in a jelly jar!

I was bound and gagged in the dining room
Surrounded by the funk of fetid breath
The quartet of maniacs hunched over me
And forced me to listen to Anthrax and Megadeth

I struggled in my restraints as they chortled with glee
While they poked at me and sliced apart my cheek
My muffled pleading only served to amuse them
As they expelled a very noxious sort of reek

I wriggled out of my ropes a bit
There was a struggle but I managed to prevail
Ghoul is still out there, haunting the graveyard
But I escaped and now I'm here to tell my tale

Ghoul Hunter!
You can bet your life that you're going to die!
Ghoul Hunter!
We'll eat you baked, boiled, or fried!
Ghoul Hunter!
You'll look just like the jerk you are!
Ghoul Hunter!
We'll pickle your brain in a jelly jar!(Instrumental)A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.

How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies? 

A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead.

Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?For what we have died 
for men`s of sun and east

Grandeur of gold
Souls taken for jewelry
Weakness of man
Visions clouded by god
Labeled as heretic`s
Murdered, burned and tortured

Man`s of god
With fear of horns
Raping land with animosity
Taking souls with no grief(Instrumental)(Instrumental)He was commander at the age of 23
Forever enslaved to his own vanity
Charging forward through the enemy lines
Death & glory will forever be entwined

His trusted scouts...they told him a tale
A mighty camp they cannot possibly assail
The braves were many and their weaknesses were few
Bold in conviction with nothing left to lose!

Riding to glory!
He was the son of the morning star
Attack before the rising sun
He was the son of the morning star

A butcher of innocents, a family affair
He rode into glory without any cares
Driven by madness, sealing his fate
On the plains of destiny, far too little, far too late

Riding to glory!
He was the son of the morning star
Attack before the rising sun
He was the son of the morning star

He was the son!
He was the son!!I said something I should not have  
Hands grad my legs and pull me in  

Thoughts of panic  
Fill my head  

Come and help me, aid me, save me  
Comfort me  

Crackled laughter  
Taunts my skin  

Cold and Damp  

Feels so cold with a blinding grief  
These clammy walls are my only friend  

Why are they so quiet?  
Worse is that I can't see  
Just a gentle flickering  
That won't let me be  

Hands grab my legs and pull me in  
Hands at my throat, no feeling left  

No more panic fills my head  
Crackled laughter calms my being, I am among friends  

Acceptance has sunken in  
I'm left gaping shivering and all my friends have leftROAR!I love the way you are
Somebody is breaking me down again
I'll take the way you are
I wish I could stop missing you
This is my mission
May it teach you how to feel
We don't cry anymore
I wait for you into my arms

They told me I could lose my mind

I saved my soul
When I see you face I remember I'm not alone
I could be wrong
When I'm far from home my heart bursts just without you

I feel it's just begun
I can believe you're the one
The moments died I cried
This is our time to lost control
The night has started
My world is over close this door
We don't cry anymore
I see you walking home alone

I know you hear me
These are my words for you
I see you walking
You'll never be aloneColors I see are sentimental figures
The mass of people touches my frozen soul
A sound delights my ears I'm here alone
And it flatters her slow vanity

Chaos - Ceremony to fear

Picture on the wall is moving to the corner
A glass of air feed my open head
I seek too long deep seasons from your room
Claring rhyme chimes in slowly painted moves

Chaos - Ceremony to fear

Out on a field I felt a cold scene
Dressed emotions like a mortal pain
Keep my brains in ice they melt away
Pink soldiers carrying major's mind

Chaos - Ceremony to fear

Should I sleep until my mind is full filled
Exposing emptiness is using only tears
Disorder in a box too hardly I tried to have
The last thing that never needs to be shared

Chaos - Ceremony to fear

Can't there just be happiness
Order of sence is running through
The gallantly dying pride of mine
Over my speech, it's fading nowA word to the wise, sonny:
I'll tell you something useful
There comes a time
When you cannot step down
You have to stand your own ground

Listen up
They don't need no reason to hate you
If they know where you come from
Folks don't like other folks who act their minds
No matter what the preacher says

Bury the head
They cannot identify without his teeth

Your own
Dad once had his eyes set
On a blue-eyed little country girl
No one told me anything about
Brutal 6-feet tower
She was his darling sweetheart

Here son
The family's heirloom

Keep it under your pillow
Then you'll dream about
The men your grandfather and I
Took down(Instrumental)Sungguh berbesar hati aku, melihat seluruh dunia nin, hancur di bawah genggaman aku.Driven from the city and into the graveyard, the fleeing hordes of indigent peasants are pursued by acidthrower wielding gangs of shock troops. The shrieks of melting villagers fill the freezing air. Down in the catacombs, oblivious, Ghoul tucks in to dinner.

II. BRINGER OF WAR
 
Pandemonium rattled the crypts
Tunnels corroded in acidulous drips
A ruckus interrupting our daily dead
As the villagers fled with acid melting their heads
Weakening stanchions, savage assault
The bodies were piled into a burial vault
There was a terrible cave-in, crushing debris
What came through the ceiling brought us right to our knees
 
A massive contrivance enveloped in bones
Cradled in death upon a sinister throne
 
Clad in iron, oxidized
Buried for years away from curious eyes
A circle emblazoned on its riveted skin
And an ominous glow illuminating within
OMICRON PROTOTYPE 77-Y
IF FOUND, PUCKER UP AND KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE
Samedi stiffened and his lips were atwitch
As a mysterious hum achieved a deafening pitch
 
A massive contrivance enveloped in bone
Cradled in death upon a sinister throne
As if to intone...
 
I am the bringer of war
Atomic death forevermore
I am the bringer of war
Behold the fury of my roar
 
Trapped in a reverie, the voodoo man fell
He dreamed of salvation through nuclear hell
Omicron energy to shatter the spell
And the vaporization of his corporeal shell
 
Stun grenades from the bully brigade
Elbows and knuckles in a violent raid
We bloodied our boots as we battled the brutes
But they netted the bomb, so all the effort was moot
Beaten down, we had to retreat
Samedi seething at our tragic defeat
A radio crackled THE WEAPON IS SEIZED
Our hackles were raised as the Commandant wheezed
 
Flee from my legions, pitiful fools!
There's nowhere to hide now, this is the end of Ghoul!
Scuttle to safety like pestilent rats
The fuse is burning quickly now that...
 
I am the bringer of war
Atomic death forevermore
I am the bringer of war
Behold the fury of my roar(Instrumental)Smegma!Everybody loves a pizza
But don't eat it if the cheese is green
Never eat it, no you shouldn't
Never eat it NO!
Everybody loves a pizza
Unless the cheese is green
Don't eat it cuz it's bad
and you will die!
you will die!
Everybody likes killing
With green pizza
With green pizza
I'll kill YOU!
I'll kill YOU!
You sorry punk, I'll kill YOU!!

In my demoniac entrails

Of the cosmos that falls in me
Misanthropic desires bleeding
Signs from the light

Sick body, diseased soul,
The demon's mark in my skin,
Cult me!!!

Total hate
In my diabolical thoughts

Plagues are kissing me forever
The black waters that run in my veins
I am a temple of gothic emotions,
Violence, suffering and sadism!!!

I'm the plagues,
I'm the black waters,
I'm the violence,
I'm the suffering,
I'm the sadism,
I'm.

I'm the Seven Legions, I'm the Seven Demons
Hail Satan!!In vain the iron-wrought tower
Pierces heaven's dome
In vain the muscle tears it's fiber
Ten more fibers blossom in its place

They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void

In vain the moat surrounds the castle
Mud skulks across its bed
In vain contraction
In vain expansion

In vain our kind seeks total order
There is a fissure at the heart of being

They tried to plant a flag
Behind the voidI sing in colors.

Scorn, torn, endless faith

For the souls at the underworld

There's a crack upon the sky
Watching what is wrong and right
An endless Armageddon

Hordes, Life and Death - The Exit Way
Lights, Holes, Steps - The side of insanity
Frames, Walls and Lines - A spiritual path
Surviving from the amazing trap

Scales of moral, a ladder shape

Hear the story and learn the truth
It's all about the afterlife of Er

Tower unimpeachable above every moment
And what I give and do not give
disappear tracelessly
Stones dropped into an endless well
The wind stirs the trees
I hear the builders striking with their hammers
and see the ruins
and the emptiness within the ruins
Vast and meaningless
An infinity and eternity of emptiness
Meaninglessness and waste
Hollow nothing
A boundless black veil
Swallowing all dimensions
And I know
And we know
The wind stirs the trees
Sunlight creeps through the branches
A reflection caught in a stream.In the beginning there was darkness so pitch
I awoke with my nose in the earth
The sweet stench of dirt and decay fills my senses
I am carrion and I am the infinite
Alpha and Omega. I am defective perfection

I am the soul of rebellion and chaos
The will to fight, fuck and kill
The plasma in the veins of like
Et Proavus Satanas!

Humanity greases the cogs of my existence
Like ants they scurry to and fro
Unaware of my ever judging eye
I should love to annihilate them in on fragment of time
Quell their presence under my thumb
Alas... I am the bastard scion...

I should liken myself to a lone cult of suffering
With a following so numerous to fill the universe
The beasts gather as the sun withers
Upon the horns of the great divinity
Et Proavus Satanas!

The circulation of the cosmos without rest
Swirling in infinity motion of time and space
I am the carrion and I am the infinite...

The carvings of civilizations passed...
Writings on the walls of blood and stone
Handed down through the ages of torture
The chance of men to forsake their future
The defy fate is to deny conception
All things must come to an end

To sacrifice my awareness for one moment of adulation
The wipe free the canvas of mortal existence
And snuff out the boundaries of being
The time has come...

Et Proavus Satanas!, I put my nose to the earth
The sweet smell of earth fills my senses, I close my eyes...(Instrumental)State of pure ecstasy 
 Ecstasy of dementia, proficient death 

 State of pure ecstasy 
 Ecstasy of dementia, proficient death 

 And the advent of neurosis 
 Until the end of time 

 The ecstasy about the neurotic state 
 Reverence for mercy will not die 
 The three final parts as yours 
 And the domains of exterminationHow come I hear life's all the same for everyone
damned as we are to the killing routine of our time
when some don't ever even wake up into this ritual
wake up, wake up to this faceless hole, unkind

There's something wrong in every step I take
it's that the way I felt, the background I had
Didn't you dare to question it?

Do love the world but all that you can't stand

Let me see myself my own capability to hate
the ruthless grind, the cold design
the lifeless time we waste and we still wait
donation for the time we're dead to the world
we're dead and irate, with hate

How come hate, I'll tell you how
how come hate, you will understand
Hate, hate, hate

VIII. DEATH CAMPAIGN
 
I was wasted
As I left Ivan's Inn on my knees
A murder of mutants
Gibbered in garrulous glee
A shot rang out
And it startled the freaks in the sacks
A hatchet was hurled at a dog man
As they mounted a violent and vicious attack
 
Limbs were bit while pants were shit
Eyes gouged out from fleshy pits
Fists met faces, boots met brains
Cobblestones slick with the blood of the slain
Bodies cleaved in twain

Death Campaign

It beggared belief
The madness I saw in the streets
A fat one was gnawing the head of a canine
A skinny one gnawed on its feet
Thundering engines
Grew louder, approaching the fray
Leather and chains, splattering brains
From up in the statue, the order, "Obey!"
 
Faces were peeled with murderous zeal
Howls for mercy were left un-appealed
Fists met faces, boots met brains
Cobblestones slick with the blood of the slain
The slaughter could not be contained

Death Campaign
 
Acidthrowers melted struts
Scaffold overrun with nuts
Ruptured rivets shattered bones
A mangled metal hell
A hail of screaming bodies
As the great colossus fell
 
Back to the Inn for a flagon of gin
Covered in carnage, my head was a-spin
Drowning in liquor to deaden my pain
Haunted by that Death CampaignMasses of numbness thriving on yawn
Thirst for dull, taste for numbI lay down my offering for the wolves of the night
I spill my own blood in their den.
I become the predator who destroys mankind
Spawn of Anyasiri be thou my hands!
The sorrow of shades sweeps forth with foul might
The howling hordes ceaselessly churn.
Souls compelled are souls possessed
And so the torch is lit.

Angel of Endless Hunger
Tsurumah, Mursiras, Mog-Pharau
Spit forth the tongueless howlers
In aeon of weakened sun
Angel of Endless Hunger
Tsurumah, Mursiras, Mog-Pharau
People of weeping summer
Spring will never come!

Amidst cut-tongue cacophony,
Bloody rapists of man.
Min-uroikas, great pit of obscenity.
Aurang and Aurax ageless in malice.

Whispering the silent screams
The gasping of many reeds.
Souls compelled are souls possessed.
The world pyre ignites.

Angel of Endless Hunger
Tsurumah, Mursiras, Mog-Pharau
Spit forth the tongueless howlers
In aeon of weakened sun
Angel of Endless Hunger
Tsurumah, Mursiras, Mog-Pharau
People of weeping summer
Spring will never come!

Spring will never come!

Wicked North is inspired heavily by the No-God Prince of Nothing series by Canadian author R. Scott Bakker. The No-God aka Tsurumah, Mog-Pharau among other names, is seemingly the antithesis of existence. His only purpose to destroy. Brought into some semblance of "life" by "The Consult" a mad cabal of sorcerers seeking to save themselves from ever-lasting damnation by sealing the world shut. Hoping to accomplishing this by annhilating all men (Men being known to the Non-men as the people of summer, for they burn so hot and pass so quick.)

The No-God's very existence made every womb barren, every child died in still-birth. The No-God destroyed entire nations beneath screaming hordes of Sranc (Also known as Tongueless howlers), a perverted war like people who sexually delight in carnage. The very threat of Sranc caused mothers to raise the knife to their babe's to save them from the barbarity. The No-God was destroyed having killed most of the peoples of the ancient north, the most advanced civilization on Earwa. The Consult, headed by Aurang and Aurax, who are the last two Inchoroi, a race of rapists and weavers of flesh retrieved the No-God's remains and have been attempting to resurrect him ever since to finish their genocidal task, and his resurrection draws ever closer to completion.

The world will be closed shut, and all who survive thrown into the harems of the Inchoroi! The world pyre ignites!(Instrumental)The ecstasy of suicide
Making love to open wounds
How the end can smile in the mirror of destiny
Now death has come

The misery of suicide making fires of twisted flesh
Making love to open wounds
How the end can smile in the mirror of destiny
Now death has come

The Hollow womb of suicideVice me in your wicked fist, I don't care, so lonely.
I'm lonely as a cursed man's wife.

I'm deep in the Night and can't find my way.
Orion, above me, with no belt and lain down.
Is it all weeds and ash snow in place of my birth?
The horn of plenty sounding so forlorn, forlorn.Altar of ashes temple of ruin-Your secrets no longer shrouded unto me-Open my eyes oh priest of serpents-Beyond the piercing light it lies-Like a great shadow falling on the Universe-It's absence starved of all light-Pillar of Daath-That which is not-All form shall be an Altar-All life a sacrifice-They have wept at your arrival-Seers of all time-Born into existence to watch existence end-They are the guardians-They are the mourners-Aflight in cosmic tomb-Towards the light eternal-In their endless vigil-Their lidless eyes have seen-Endless unmaking of suns-Skinless failures of flesh-Unmade by the blight-Rejoice as the light flickers and then-Dies(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Deceived by the lost one, you worship the wrong idol
He told you he's the bringer of liberation 
Manipulate and brainwash your mind with his lies
Enjoying cult following from the ignorance of man

Satanic dreams never become reality
Wasting life walking on path of deception 
Relying on "the hope" that never be fulfilled
At the end, only eternal torture you must face 

Is there any evidence of Satanic victory? 
It's all in your mind, awakened by sin
A hope without faith in God is impotence
Illusions of power and glory are part of his deception
A logical philosophy?
You've betrayed, you've deceived
All creations belong to God the creator!

Face the fact, God is the only Lord
He give us Christ to banish all the sin
Satanic philosophy comes from nothing but lies
When you die, you will know who is right(Instrumental)As the Darkness creeps over the Northern mountains of Norway 
 and the silence reach the woods, I awake and rise... 
 Into the night I wander, like many nights before, 
 and like in my dreams, but centuries ago. 

 Under the Moon, under the trees. 
 Into the Infinity of Darkness, 
 beyond the light of a new day, 
 into the frozen nature chilly, 
 beyond the warmth of the dying Sun. 
 Hear the whispering of the wind, 
 the Shadows calling... 

 I gaze into the Moon which grants me visions 
 these twelve full Moon nights of the year, 
 and for each night the light of the holy disciples fades away. 

 Weaker and weaker, one by one. 

 Weaker and weaker, one by one. 

 I gaze into the Moon which makes my mind pure as crystal lakes, 
 my eyes cold as the darkest winter nights, by yet there is a flame inside. 

 It guides me into the dark shadows beyond this world, 
 into the infinity of thoughts... thoughts of upcoming reality. 

 In the name of the almighty Emperor I will ride the Lands in pride, 
 carrying the Blacksword at hand, in warfare. 

 I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones. 
 Despair will be brought upon 
 the hoping children of happiness. 

 Wherever there is joy the hordes of the eclipse 
 will pollute sadness, sadness and hate 
 under the reign if fear. 

 The lands will grow black. 
 There is no Sunrise yet to come 
 into the wastelands of phantoms lost. 

 The lands will grow black. 
 There is no Sunrise yet to come. 

 May these moments under the Moon be eternal. 
 May the infinity haunt me... In Darkness.you spend your days whoring yourselves
your closed minds don't realise
filth and decay is all you preach
into the light and your fucking blind

sink into the depths of despair
lost your way so you follow the flock
insane are your rules, you deny your instincts
so pure, your existance
pure fucking filth

you spend your days living the lie
your destiny lies in mediocrity
continue to rot and spread the disease
deny the animal and then you rape their minds

pushed to the edge of your sanity
triumph with displays of vigilanceSensi
Dives me
Into
Love and wisdom

No escape from this brutal reality

I want to get so high
Away from this sick world
Away from this chaos

Smoke shroud(s) my body
It's arousing my senses
Extending my consciousness
My perception of humans' perversion(s)

No more control
We need to smoke
Free the weed

Fume de la ganja, fume de la ganja !

KI-KE-PUI-KUK SMOKE ! KI-KE-PUI-KUK SMOKE !I blame everybody but me
I'm such a fucking coward
So little time and yet I waste my life
Come on and waste your life!
Come on and waste your life!

Heard it, but my brain gets no light
I have no insight
I'm weak and can't fight
What should I do?

Mimic behaviours?
They're desired by these crops of failures

So many questions to ask of you
Will you lie like always or tell the truth
Is she my mother?  Is she my father?  Is she my sister?

I know nothing
Because everything is something
That's lying while receiving deceiving
But I'm still listening to whispered insisting, lying relieving, truth bereaving
So she my mother?  Or she my father?  Or is she my sister?
No, she's my (son)
She's my fucking sonLeaves fall
And wander through the air,
Like ash from a burning home.

In the wind,
The trees whisper,
"We do not forgive. We do not forgive."

Every breath of Winter air
Sharply kisses the trees
And the mourner's faces.
It is relentless.

The elms stand over the mourners,
With arms raised in sorrow.
The trees are born of the skeletons that inhabit the earth between their roots,
And they grow forth into towering skeletons,
Above the black huddled mass.
The trees never knew-
Now they know the bottom.

A hole is in the earth,
People are thrown in it,
And dirt.
Each family member offers
A handful of dust,
To the quiet and reposed.

They have always taken,
But now, at last, to their fondest, they give
A handful
Of dust.These are days of our revival
The las moments for reaping the seeds sown
Civilizations must to be aware to all the signs
Signs of the end of our earthly time

Let the people see the coming of the Son of Man
The return of the Thunderous Might
We shall see the Holy One upon His Throne
We shall meet the Risen face to face

Love has opened the gate to the eternity
Love that heals our wounds and scars
Love who washes away the dark taint of sin
The same Love who once crucified

Let the people see the coming of the Son of Man
The return of the Thunderous Might
We shall see the Holy One upon His Throne
We shall meet the Risen face to face

Down here, seeing our corrupted world
Drowing with its deadly desires
Religions, ideologies, and moral teachings
Cannot save us from the state called death

The Spirit has warned us time to time
As voces that heard beneath us
Calling the ones who are dying to see the Truth
The ones who want to be saved

There is a way, a path to follow
A path of the great escape
A path where Truth belongs there
Hear the final call...(music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras) 

Falling - oh tonight I feel like a falling star
Leaving all I got at your cash bar
I say - this is where I saw you baby

Dizzy - feeling like a crazy rolling stone
you can call me Mr. Psycho all night long
I say - this is where we'll get together

Playing - it's the kind of game you play one on one
a Russian roulette without the gun
I say - don't you think it's getting hot now?

Wasted - tempted by the lights of every place I see
hope next morning it won't be just debris
of a night we spent together

The train of fun'n'games is leaving
it's heading straight for Daydream Boulevard

//chorus
Hey girl - together on the road to hell - the both of us under this spell
Hey girl - a blink of light inside your eyes - a fire between your thighs
Hey girl - it's hard to not fall in love - your smile fits like a glove
Hey girl - this daydream where we meet was made for you and me

Rocking - in this street I am the rock'n'roll star
cigarettes, honey and an old guitar
I say - nothing can stop me tonight

The train of fun'n'games has left now
it headed straight for Daydream Boulevard

Oh yeah! - I may feel a little strange
but damn every time I come into this place
I get fuckin' high in a state of grace
Now that we are here to taste it
come with me on your knees, let's get free(Instrumental)Uitgestrekte armen
Bevroren pose
Krampachtige vingers
Doorprikken
Klamme nevels
Duizenden strelingen
Vluchtig als stromend water
Langs mijn gezicht
Ik aai je ruwe huid
Maar je blijft onbewogen
Nietig gebaar
Met verheven hoofd
Hang je in de wolken
Er is geen grond
Diepe groeven in je gelaat
En ogen
Die mij eeuwen geleden
Reeds aanschouwden
Schitteren in het blauwe licht
Ik aai je
Tot mijn handen bloeden
Aderen zoeken wortels
Ik knoop ze aan elkaar
Samen met de Ogenboom
Hij slaapt in de wolken
Ik in zijn tranenbedFled from the beaten tracks of men
Blood coagulated with melancholy
Black bile rising again
Waiting for the heavy fall
The tremendous weight
The failure of transmutation
In a fleshy tomb
Buried above groundI didn't ask for this 
Paths crossed for what? 
The years of bullshit kept coming back 
The endless failures 
You can't change 

You will be written out of this history 
With no trace left 

The final chapter of a hack written shit romance 
It's fucking over for real this time 
Don't write, don't callThere is the hot girl, a wanna be model
There's the ugly one, who thinks she is delicious
There's a school girl, who wanna blow her teacher
The same people over and over again

There is a smart guy, a wanna be genius
The photographer, who thinks he won a prize
There's the office chief, a wanna be martyr
The same people over and over again

They all belong in a circus
that should have been shut down for good

And then there's "you and me", to think we see
are wild and beautiful, pure and different
You and me, our world is free
from all their hollowness, we are different from all.
The boring thing that they call life
A life that has already been lived by someone else

There is the poor kid, bullied by bastards
There's the big jerk, who thinks he's always right
(The) local band, who act like Motley Crue
The same people over and over again

The politician, he'd sell you for a dime
The musician, who couldn't write a rhyme
The follower, stalker, the greedy or the vain
The same individuals over again

They all belong in a circus
that should have been shut down for good

"Ladies and Gentlemen get your tickets now! The show is continuous.
It's never out, it's never over, it goes on all the time!
We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities.
They did not ask to be brought into the world, but into the world we came.
Come forward, come forward! Welcome to the freak show!"

They all belong in a circus. The sideshow of Life.I am a demon of flesh 
My past is misery 
My time on earth 
is like a hell 

Hate is my father 
Fear is my mother 
my faith is vain 
because my heart is pain 

Animal 
i am animal 
heartsick 
Animal 
i am animal 
being without feeling 

I kill people 
to satiate my thirst for blood 
but it never stops 
it's like a drug for the soul 

I will kill and I will kill 
until the burning fire 
have spent all my being 
in a grandiloquent momentum 

Animal 
i am an animal 
heartsick 
Animal 
i am an animal 
being without feeling(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I'm awaken to an onslaught of hell-bent machinery!
Here to erase any trace of resistance.
Ordered to kill the will of any human subsistence.
What's the good in continuity of the government when everyone's dead?Release his beaten army
Show me immortal ones
As the land starts to bleed
Rivers now blood - filled
Attack upon man and beast
Lice infected, swarm
Amphibious epidemic rules
Plague across the land

Land left so desolate
Watch it drift away
Hear last commandment
Justice to be done
See the first born of kin
Consumed in a sea of death
Land released from holy rule
Kill the Pharaoh king

Lands so cancerous 
Anthrax infected flock
Ashes begin to blister
Ruptures on man's skin
Hail falls as fires burn
Disaster raining down
leaving land exposed to pain
Pharaohs evil rule

Shadows fall upon 
Locusts start to feed
Strip the crops, expose the sand
Condemn this desert land
Sky darkens three days long
Darkness all to rule
Every man blind to see-
What this lands become

See the sign, smeared
Blood of sacrificed
Devour with haste, the flesh
Never water sodden, burn
Plague comes to pass
Smite Egyptian first born
Follow and live by demand
Leave Egyptian land

Children to live in fear
follow cloud of dust
Column of fire dictates
See the sight of war
Guarded night and day
Encamp by nature's side
Carrying bones of the dead
Mistrusted god commands

Rested by coast of sea
Let the Pharaoh come
Chariots six-hundred strong
led by chosen few
Retreat across divided sea
Closes upon ungodly son
My hand shall destroy
We all be dead menNOISE OF THE DEAD EXPLOSION

When it was flaring up the sky
The speed of unholy atoms
Kreating a new insivible tunnel
That none could see or await

They say it was dark and burning
In this place where Devils are made
Kissed by nekro touches of radiation
Not even their matter was safe

Mutating through the roaring sound
A new form had awaken
Pure fire to extinguish
The Flesh that had never been theirs
And beyond it fulfilled...

"If the glare of thousand suns
Would suddenly break through the sky,
This would be equal to the splendour of Him
I am dead
Destroyer of the world"


NuKlear Girl 1.30 pm / 1.35 pm 22/08/00Joyful sinners
 Gathering around their parade
 For future they feast
 Soon smashed by so called justice

 Ridiculous hypocrites
 Declaring
 Spreading hate and tearing
 Polluting the source of ignorance

 So this is the fall of man
 Grief for the gods
 Or is it the born of purpose
 Long awaited recalibration

 We are the light
 Statements made
 Were not right
 Against the global powers we rise

 Dishonored defenders
 Revealing the truth
 Behind
 The hands of unknown

 I alone testify
 My sins, so please justify
 And i shall proceed
 David versus goliath

 So this is the fall of man
 Grief for the gods
 Or is it the born of purpose
 Long awaited recalibrationLook, look at the way it turns
The wind, nothing will make it learn
See the snow on its lonely ride
Watch, gently they all collide

Touch, place your hands on the frozen ground
Caress the eyes of this cold, cold land
Feel, there's nothing to feel any more
Numb, I'm bitterness to the core

Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Moving it back and forth
Stuck in the frozen north

Look, look at the way it burns
Nothing, nothing will make us learn
Feel, the grasp of my cold, cold hand
Alone, the eyes of this cold, cold land

Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Moving it back and forth
Stuck in the frozen north

Look, look at the way it turns
The wind, nothing will make it learn

Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Moving it back and forth
Stuck in the frozen northlmao(Instrumental)the blackest magic
you will soon miss the dawn
all the secrets of the mind
lost within the afterglow
suspect everyone
leaving when it's dark
the curse might become
a great wisdom for all

Nobody sees
the evil behind this time
it's going to free us
by killing us all

absorb it now
all the unknown
don't show it out
absorb psychosis

Never let it loose
the dark destructive power
elements of chaos
can be seen from far
deep down under
all the black souls lie
even a move
can make them die

rainbows turn black
by the darkness
I will rise
from the hell

absorb it now
all the unknown
don't show it out
absorb psychosis

I will now fall
to my darkest depths
i will guide myself
trough my own liesShe said I'm sorry baby I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new he's waitin' in the car outside
Ah honey how could you do it
We swore each other everlasting love
she said well yeah I know but when
We did - there was one thing we weren't
Really thinking of and that's money
Money changes everything
Money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doin'
That don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything

They shake your hand and they smile
And they buy you a drink
They say we'll be your friends
We'll stick with you till the end
Ah but everybody's only
Looking out for themselves
And you say well who can you trust
I'll tell you it's just
Nobody else's money

Money changes everything
Money changes everything
We think we know what we're doin'
But we don't pull the strings
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything
Money changes everything
Money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
We don't know a thing
It's all in the past now

Money changes everything
Money changes everything
Money changes everything(Instrumental)Random acts of knifings

Rage has enraged our desires
You shall feel our wrath
As we dance thru the fire
A constant war path

Random acts of knifings

Starved we stand with very little hope
With scalps in hand, we deny your plans
We've come for your throat

Random acts of knifings

Rise or fall, could be the death of us all
But we'll take that chance with knives in hand

Random acts of knifings

This promise like blood will continue to spill
And fall from our lips and drip
From the tips of our salivating tongues

Random acts of knifings

Your only weapon is your mind
Fuck that we've got knives

On that sacred night
Thru sacrifice, we're finally satisfied
Our appetite
By the way of the knife we have taken
Back our lives
Slice by blood thirsty sliceI want more, I want all.
I will steal, I will kill.
We are possessed by greed.
We want everything.
Why not to have a bigger house
than the neighbours, and the most
expensive car in the street.

You envy people their nose between
their eyes
and the cripple his crutch as also
their holes between the halves.

A starveling can save a lot of money
for food.
A prisoner needn't support children.
And blind man doesn't buy books
Your greed hasn't any borders.
Why are you like this too?

Do you want to take everything
to the grave?
Everyone will rot under the clay,
and your property and everything
will stay upward.

I can't see, I can't hear.
Iwant more, I want all.
I will kill and I'll take
everything from everyone.(Instrumental)I, king in yellow, with burning retinas reflecting through
Vast seas of time and space
My madness sheds light upon my kingdom
I forfeit my birthright for a moment of bliss.
I freeze the moment with my will.
Each passing breath a brick in my eventual demise.Disown

No soul [X12]I arrived at the Jackhammers game

Only to be greeted by the 4 horsemen of Mexico

Fernando, Baltazar, Lupe, and Blair!

I knew of their intentions to overthrow the churro stand

Hurling their bladed sombreros

Decapitating all their fans

Battle at the churro stand. UNITE!(Instrumental)Torpor:

Untold suffering of the masses
Based on
Personal vendetta

Rotted organs slide
From festered wounds
Becoming feed for man and beast
Alike

The blood fuels a macrbre quest
Apocolypic yet noble
To butcher the innocent and guilty alike
With goals of
Advancement of power

The slaughter blooms terror and destruction
Blood soaked earth
To rend and tear the most vital of ograns
They know now
Final death has arrived

Cadavers hung by intestine trails
Cursed with affintiy for blood
Sumptous feast comprised of all life
No concious to express guilt
Humanity transfromed into base desire
By choice or opposed
Power gained by dark embrace
Damnation the overarching clause

The blood fuels a macrbre quest
Apocolypic yet noble
To butcher the innocent and guilty alike
With goals of
Advancement of power

The slaughter blooms terror and destruction
Blood soaked earth
To rend and tear the most vital of ograns
They know now
Final death has arrived

Rotted organs slide
From festered wounds
Becoming feed for man and beast
Alike

Ruined soul struggles
For meanings
Some find mercy
Others inhumanity

The beast rises within
Accompanied by boiling blood
A rage that consumes all rationality
Friends and foes are composities

To question
Is to find

the key to creativity

it depends on anyone in the course of time

songs like a strike

when I'm in between false and right
I'm waiting for inspiration from a soul of sanity
another victim of the emptiness?

Because i don't follow the same way as them
Because I'm a kind of monster, different inside
Their rules and beliefs doesn't satisfy me
Alone with myself and I
To the forest i go
Fresh wind, surrounded by mother nature
Daytime looks like a paradise
Night time, feels like a thrill
...We create all of these stories ourselves
This planet still got many riddles
Opium of people, these gods of TV, these new stars
this delicious brainwashing...
Noises and wind change, as sounds around
All different, just like me
I want to desecrate this, it desensitize me
What i see in this society
When they obliterate and then dominate
Their way through power and mass control
Holy scripts, verses of chaos into manipulated hands
Satanic signs, reverse of this cross of torture, won't guide me

I don't belong to both of them, i don't feel pitiful without following
a flock of sheep, I don't feel lost without one of your books
I'll built my army, they will seep out and wade to this place
I use my cauldron, and my spells,to do it
They are here with iron jaws, ready to behead the real enemy
They'll adorn your place with blood stains,and piece of scraps for pigs
I won't come back as your queen, even as your god
I'll let you free to make yourself, if it's not too late
Alone you fear what you don't understand
Coward, you'd rather being with your sheep friends
To all of these mystery, no clear answers you got
Alone in the darkness, you're scared
...are the heroes of this modern society
Information and cultures are all open to you, sweet sheep
move your big ass to the library, and make yourself
Don't let them make you a stupid stereotype!*Storm rise - in velvet skies last thunder
In flashes of light lays Earth paralised
Reality fades in apocalyptic visions

It's everlast wisdom that buried in minds
Forgotten by people that make the war

For countless sins that now covered by time

Condemned to keep the core of the evil
Like blind in a wasteland we run through the life
Awaiting the day when the truth will rise.parallel dimensions: on frequencies sublime.

Get out the holly 
Wrap up warm 
Don't be a wally 
You've got a guest for Christmas 
One not easy to please 
Satanic to the core 
And drinks gravy with ease 

Christmas 
It's all too much 
Tinsel 
Fire hazard 
You've 
Run out of luck 
When you spend 
Christmas with Satan 

He takes his turkey dry 
And is good at charades 
Only signs his name in blood 
On his Christmas cards 
Don't expect a present 
All you'll get are rats 
And with those sharp horns 
He'll ruin all your hats

Christmas with SatanBlack holes for eyes am I hollow inside?
Curse upon me venom fed through deceit.
Reach out his hand made of ashes and sand,
so here you stand facing void in your mind.

Time needs no healing, life flows regardless any of us!
We are a species that houses both majesty and decadence.

Pain...can you feel what your are doing him?
Mourn once never more shed all your pain in just one tear!
Arise or live as a slave! Is this what you craved for?

A whisper from a forsaken ghost:
"Sanity abhorred. Complete deceit based upon remorse of blind followers. Never obey or you will fall prey of what you reject. Believe your own passion for only it will bring you peace".

All have a weakness know it and you'll tame all behemoths and insects.
Do you feel like a wolf between lambs, can't you see you're the prey?
This curse on me, mind overwhelmed;
sense lost with every breath.

(We need to live life for those who unfortunately couldn't. For those who bring joy with every breath they take; before them I shall bow, so should you!)

My eyes stare at the nothingness of your shallow image.
At the corner of this sphere you will find GOOOD!!!

Please do not burden your happiness on me,
for it's a weight too great to have on my back.

As my senses fade I can see and observe,
the true nature of this race: we ain't the same.

There is a beast we are all serving, it's inside of us.
Hidden at sight, the quest to hunt this beast we despise began.
Soils swept, seas dried; we are approaching: Forth to kill the beast!
Finally trapped we awed in sorrow: mirror shows the worst!Listen to me!When your last year seems like yesterday
And an end feels not too far away
Think of the things you know are true
That destiny holds a lot more time for you.

Fear can't keep you down.
Make your weakness your crown.
Conquer the fear within your mind
- take hold of your own destiny...

Keep up that hill, don't stray from your path.
Choose not to follow temptation's way.
Integrity's my pride - loneliness my bride.
The struggle never ends - day after day after day.

Fear can't keep you down.
Make your weakness your crown.
Conquer the fear within your mind
- take hold of your own destiny...


Conquer the fear - day after day.
Conquer the fear within your mind
- take hold of your own destiny...This world's become so jaded 
What's left of life has faded 
Can you pull me out? 
Can you save me somehow? 
I've grown tired of waiting 

This broken man 
Will make his stand 
A martyr of his own 
Generation 
That's come undone 
Will waste away alone 

In this place of false convictions 
Where the truth has turned to fiction 
Its time to change our ways 
Time to turn a new page 
Escape the mindless self addiction 

Now we've found an ending 
We can stop pretending 
That it will be okay 
Dark will dawn the new day 
Black's reign beginning(Instrumental)Vacuum
maybe I'll find a light
at the end of tunnel.
I had the best moments
never again.

imprisoned in dark feelings
my arms burning, not staunch the pain
caused by my feelings
happiness I had was a
passing cloud... 

It was just a dream
becoming reality
I was thinking that would be happy
but again I was wrong
a stumble and fell into the abyss filled with heartbreak and melancholy
impossible to get outWAR!

Pain was an abetor from cradle through secluded life
All can't be seen
Just the shattered dreams
Inside of me-Exciting me
Light of the dawn is as dark as I
Deluding

Lasting delusion of embrace
I don't know what color is blackness
Mistress of the agony refers it
I don't hate you 
Want you to feed me

Gist of guilt has pacified my innocence
Incendiary of immaculate
Overdose is near

Bending over limits 'till a dead end
Wounding eruption encites me
I'm not waiting for it to leave me

You feel the life only hates
And the frozen stares you take
Like an open sight for THE SADDEST GRIEF
Set a lust of living drown
Depression waiting your arrive
You must pray the Lord to forgive

Unlike purity imbibes my charm mirror's serving me
Resemblance of illusion and actuality

Lasting delusion..

You feel the life...Deceiver of this world, beware
Tremble in your heart, you scared
Your destruction time is near
Have no mercy for your fear 

Serpent's legions, devil troops 
Terror drift in cries of war
The air is thin and time stands still
Soldiers ready for the kill

Prophecy shall be completed

New world order, souls shall fall,

When God destroy all heavens,
no star will be reserved
Fire came down from Heaven
No evil thing shall be survived

Burning flesh, tainted wounds
Second death will follow soon
For the wicked, the price is death
when the book of life's been read

In fire the earth devoured
Scattered bodies, eternal pain

(Violess, gob!)Majestic and unconquered you appear to my eye 
You've kept the pride of olden days 

My mind is taken back when I touch you 
And I can hear great seas moaning 
Cut asunder by your power 
In deadly dance of fire 
To the lost coasts 
You were taking the unconquered ancient times 

And though my sun of glory set 
Nobody ever shall forget 
The terror of my name 
And oft shall ancient heroes rise 
New planets in these northern skies 
Through clouds of blood and flame 

The Moon blesses your grand shape with light 
Fierce winds will fill your weaved dress anew 
You wake up to the Gods' call 
Ready for the last march 
Oh I yearn for your touchSo many shiny things 
Cant control your hands? 
Feel the addiction to try them 
Make a increase in demand 

Economy, your religion 
More liquidity to spend 
Pour the riches to the sewers 
Waste your money on cars 

Consumption 
The way of the world 
Share it on facebook 
Let your friends drool over stuff too 

Drown yourself in filth 
Choke on chocolate bars 
Make an offering 
To the business gods 

Buy buy buy buy consume more 

Have a present 
Go ahead treat yourself 
Lust for materia 
Anyways its all what you care for 

Your precious relationships 
Ditch them to the bin 
These awesome lego bricks 
All what you really need(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Snuck out in the dead of night
Pa was snoring in his chair
It was meant to be my night
Of entry to the realm of lust
Secret meeting in the woods
Behind the sawmill's banished grounds
Waited 'till the rise of dawn
But she never did appear

Something's wrong
A schizm has occured

My nerves are steadily oscillating
Vibrating stronger and stronger still

Something is not how it should be
Itching in my spine like spiders
Crawling

Unattainable fuck
Unreachable orgasm
I cannot raise the dead
I cannot raise the dead

I had waited many years
For her to come of age
Gave her letters after school
Conveyed by my brother
She gave her word
That I would pluck her first
Then I found her note stuck
Beside the water bucket

Something's wrong
A schizm has occured

I went on a hunch
On the third day after lunch
Long since departed
The rusted machinery
Suddenly I freeze
I see the torn dress
Betrayal by kin
Mauled in the cotton ginSuccumbing to the monster inside
I stumble through the depths
Struggling to ward off the guilt
Spawning demonic apparitions
Through the crowd I meet the Executioner's gaze
As my world's set ablaze

The stone splits open as the fire grows near
Clinging to the edge of sanity
Blistered hands force me to let go
And then the void swallows me whole

The Executioner calls out to me
His blackened mask is all I see
The Executioner calls out my name
He is forever haunting me

Surrounded by nothing
I'm falling deeper into the dark
Battling demons of my own design
Drag me down
Broken glass lies in wait in the depths of the void
The mirror forever taunts me
Mocking all that I've done
Drag me down

No purpose will you find
Live your life imprisoned by a lie

The cavern of broken glass begins to flood
The freezing water has iced my blood
Struggling against the rising tide
I'm panicking, dying, I'm going blind
The Executioner drags me down
But I won't drown
I won't drown

The water grows still and there's no hope for escape
I look down and begin to accept my fate
I cease my struggle and begin to sink
The Executioner's Calling has claimed me

The Executioner calls out to me
His blackened mask is all I see
The Executioner calls out my name
He is forever haunting me(Instrumental)Air drag, drop and frag
Proportion for domination
Destiny's damnation
It's broke up
Fuckin' rough
Bitter propulsion
Confusion and velocity
Shadowy mass caged ferocity
Evidence of dead atmosphere
Insignificant normal being is here
Propulsion dreams nailed to the air
Science awakens
Flies up by there
Out-of-this-world
Ultraviolet instrument
Plasma forms
Thicken like cementSecret ancient lunar bases
Blackest tower rising up
Hidden in the darkest shadows
Blackest diamond in the rough

Ancient fortress, blackened shadow
Cast upon the lunar floor
Blinking lights in the distance
Stretching down into the core

Void of soul
Behold the castle of cold!
All behold! Behold!

The dark side dwells beneath the mantle
Regolithic structure reaching out for battle
Gleaming sun reflects upon the crystal castle
Casting the coldest spell!Dread keep - heirs masters voice
Wailing maudlin cacophony
Conjure a woken dire sequence

Wermhole to Reapusnova
Thee vision bestowed

Apparatus of the Swey
Usher of Outre
Siphoning the Ether
Ululant Piper
Archivingtillions...(Instrumental)I do not wish to worry much
your hearing, gentlemen,
when it is necessary to have a drink
and pay off the debt to one's thirst.
But allow me only to say
what now rests in my heart
before into the castle chambers
I shall look with you goodselves:
Now, I am your captain
and my office is
that i give my word to laws
where the crime throws its shadow.
After my father being von Satrapold
Also they know me at Court
the society there pay hommage to me,
which I admit with eagerness !
What an exquisite decoration
of the walls by Belgian velvet !
But the vessel is up to its brim
- we shall sweep fast away that rabble !
and I wish to tell this freely
that we will get ready a trick for the Devil,
who then will whine in his cell !Oblivion - like grey thread, rounds grey cocoon
Loss - like gloomy dream, rounds consciousness
Tiredness - like heavy stone, afflicts heavy head
Darkness - like boomerang , returns each time
I look in to a gulf , I strain my eyes
I look out for hope in the dark pit
Falling my body in the black depth
Will I find something on the bottom?
I persist ... for a while
What does it mean?
I persist ... to spite myself
I persist ... against my logic
My feeling fade away - I'm looking for them
But where do they hide themselves?
Where do they fade away?
I persist.... but nothing else
I live.... and that's all
I thing ...just to spite other
I am...and I can't change it(Instrumental)A living thing, any being, every ranking falls 
In the cracks of the ignorance written on the wall, if you let it 

But everything could change, 
back to the original status 
To manufacture a society perpetuating science 

But the information we're fed is all shitted 
And if you think you can't forget, well then you can just forget it 

Enter into a new paradigm where everybody listens 
To the fact that anything is possible if you will it 

Everywhere you look there is an obvious sign 
Looking back to when things were different, a simpler time 
Understand that your mind is infinite there is no limit 
You have the power to control every facet of life 
If you will it! 

Witness the pineal opening up in front of you 
Don't have to pray, it's like any other choice, just choose it! 

Ignoring anything that's getting in the way of your choosing 
A new eye is open, now that you can see the world for what it is 

You will come to find that you've been living a lie 
And if you think you can survive it then you're ready to 

Die for the wolves that see you as ignorant sheep that are willing
To walk a perfect line, subjugating, doing their bidding 

Everywhere you look there is an obvious sign 
Looking back to when things were simpler, a different time 
Understand that there is no limit your mind is infinite 
You have the power to control every facet of life 

Strangled to death 
The noose, wrapped around your throat 
Your lucky if you ever see the light of day 
Trapped in your home 

Breaking the chains 
Escape from all of the bigotry 
You don't have to sit still anymore 

Open your mind 
This is the only way 
You have to fucking will it 
The true potential's locked inside of youA fleeting consideration
Time elapsed
Quash all concepts
Deteriorate the flourish
Emancipate your temple
Let the embers erupt...

Logic evaporated
Missing time
Limitless
Rotten to the core

The temple is doomed
Burnt to cinders
The temple is doomed
Burnt to cinders

Blacked outPALE DREAD HUNGER, COME TAKE ME NOW

RIP OUT MY HEART, WATCH ME RESTLESS

WATCH ME FALL DOWN AND DIE

IT'S OVER FOR ME NOW, NO GOING BACK

I'VE LOST THE WILL TO LIVE.


I WILL ARISE AS DEATH, AS PALE DREAD HUNGER.


PALE DREAD HUNGER, COME TAKE ME NOW

WALK WITH DARKNESS, WATCH ME RESTLESS

WATCH ME RICE UP AND SMILE

IT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN, MY AFTERLIFE

FOR ALL ETERNITY.


I WILL ARISE AS DEATH, AS PALE DREAD HUNGER.


..IT WAS JUST A MOMENT IN TIME, JUST A PASSING THOUGHT,

AND WHO WILL RECALL THAT I EVER LIVED AT ALL.

NO MORE WILL I FEEL THE WARMTH OF THE SUN, THE CHILL OF NIGHT I HAVE BECOME.

TO FOREVER ROAM ACROSS THE SILENT EDGE OF DARKNESS, AND THE SHADOWS OF PALE, DREAD, HUNGER.


GIVE ME FIRE

COVER OF G.B.H. TRACKThe kiss of an illusion
The trees of a Realmss
Where the Spirits speak to me and for the lifeFrom now on I'm an executive dynasty
When your eyes begun to blind
Infinite desire 
Deed of charity
satiated For occupation of Queenly mystery
Through the flames back to fantasies
I'll obtain my faith

How long will last the spirit in my blood
A Second of conspiracy
Naked under a world of rage

To become stigmatized as a Saviour
And a yielding besets the flight
An imposing termination
I'll convert your thoughts
Insincerely I come across the doors
Loss beyond return with a proud of my arise
Nearly occupied

How long will last the spirit in my blood

Naked under a world of rage
Wicked for destiny's embrace

I forsee devotion turns against

From now on I instigate for nullity
Prosperity declines
Finite submission
Instigation-Defeat
Castigated by replaced misery
Broken endurance
Through the pain back to suffering
I'll obtain my faith

How long will...
I forsee...God has been heard to speak
in many enraged remorses
High, high from the blasphemous peak
the paradise was built with corpses

God has been heard to end
in life there no trust or pity
Blamed and nailed, the sins from past
full of god's guilty
In the vortex of scarlet demise, the seeds of unbelief creations
excelling from murders, excelling from lies, this is the road of internal damnation
The scars of a brain in the torment of haze, depressed without execution
deranged of ambitions, a god to extinction, the terror of witness confession

Without sense all the shapes of deceiver,
a madness with no cause
Every time for the crown, the Redeemer,
will he break the moral laws
The labyrinth of mind from the believers,
a vortex full of clones
In the madness of god and fever,
the dimension of fraud

In solitude, he drowned
surrounded by thousand slaves
A measure for flesh and soul
the art of seven days

And he paints marbling graves,
around the land of fake idols
He despised the words and prophecies
And binding the inmost desires.

Hither, thither, oh fearless masterless
Hither, thither, grounded by angriness [2x]

Without sense all the shapes of deceiver,
a madness with no cause
Every time for the crown, the Redeemer,
will he break the moral laws
The labyrinth of mind from the believers,
a vortex full of clones
In the madness of god and fever,
the dimension of fraud

God has been heard to weep
intended of falling forever
Blind and lost by design of will
of trash and unwashed guilt
God has been reapA sketch of a man
In the corner of a page
A cell in amber
A shadow of a soul

From this step I rise
Transform and evolve
From nothingness
And its innocent purity

Transparent flesh
And mercury blood
Flowing and turning
Like a berserk storm

Feelings from the void
Immaculate thoughts
The first step forward
And the line on the ground

In this world I rule
Conquer and absorb
In this emptiness
And its expanding heart

Transparent flesh
And mercury blood
Flowing and turning
Like a berserk storm
Like a berserk storm
Like a berserk storm(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Cat scans inside, conducted, without soul, or are you 
Deep inside, piece of you, fragmentation, variant 
Sunbaked you, fossil soul, counts misfortune, one minute old 
After you've, hacked your way in, you can show, yourself. 
The fucking way out. 

Information jet lag 
Kills me on a dime 
Riding mice 
Into a brave new world.(Instrumental)Ever since the time when the tower of Babylon fell
The mother of harlots is binding mankind to her spell
Darkening the world since her light has been revealed
Baptizing the pure in the blood of her impurity

Mystery - Babylon the great
Papacy - Church of heresy

Drunken with the blood of the saints which she has slain
The poison of deception is running through her veins
Dressed in scarlet and purple, precious stones and gold
All the world shall bow before the whore

Mystery - Babylon the great
Papacy - Church of heresy

Creation of the human mind
Eternal scourge of mankind
Enslavement in the name of Christ
Submit the world to lies divine

Delusive inventor of God, Satan, Heaven and Hell
Summoning her flock of blind sheep by the sound of the bell
World domination by the fear for the anger of god
Mankind's true records drowned in fire and blood

Mystery - Babylon the great
Papacy - Church of heresyHe's the wolf screaming lonely in the night
He's the blood stain on the stage
He's the tear in your eye
Been tempted by his lie
He's the knife in your back
He's rage
He's the razor to the knife
Oh, lonely is our lives
My heads spinnin' round and round
But in the seasons of wither
We'll stand and deliver
Be strong and laugh and

[Chorus:]
Shout-shout-shout
Shout at the devil
He'll be the love in your eyes
He'll be the blood between your thighs
And then have you Cry for more
He'll put strength to the test
He'll put the thrill back in bed
Sure you've heard it all before
He'll be the risk in the kiss
Might be anger on your lips
Might run scared for the door
But in seasons of wither
We'll stand and deliver
Be strong and laugh and

[Chorus]Standing in these vast deserts, I'm free of what smothers me!
Loneliness became the best friend, insects lacking all feelings! Sinking planets into hunger!

Submission to an unseen creature a creation of God: perfect con!
We still love to destroy despite our capacity to create!
Creating bloodlines of misanthropy, a taste of deception lingers in me!

The flaws that fed this race will as well starve to death, I won't be this way.
Images that deceive your thoughts a war that rages inside all of us!
A smothering race that infects and plagues all of life;
the suffocation grows with every breath I take!

A creature so complex, like no one; can't unwind!

I'll never fall in the hypocrysy of mourning an unknown death!
It's depressing how people change when driven by ambisions and greed
Does your end justify the means?
This is our last call!

I'll crave for loneliness and the peace found in it;
would you diminish the rest for your ascent?
This race breeds duality proud and shame are we?
Swallowed hatred for too long, how will this surface?

The warmest embrace drench in lies, we are blind we want to!
Although sometimes truth hurt it's the best way to open our eyes!
Death is the shadow that follows us from sunrise!
Destiny: nothing within none.
Time devours everything, time devours every pain!(Instrumental)After the sun descendance,
when the shadows of the cemetery cross
is bound to the obscurity
No more children's snicker, no more games...
everybody's afraid of the Lady in Black...
Once mortal virgin, now an un-dead creature
wake up in your grave
and arise from your death,
innocent corrupted soul, you feed yourself with blood
pure children slaughtered by Lady in Black
With the light of the torches for company
four men came for her
flowers scattered on a maiden grave
they met the eyes of the creature of Hell
They were the eyes of the beloved,
for shape and color
but the eyes were filled with the fire of Hell
She was coming nearer with a
languish grace, then She said:
"Come, my lover, leave the other and come to me.
My arms, they desire you.
Come we will lay together.
Come, my groom, Come!"
But the husband arms killed her and then
he kissed Her with the tenderness of a lover
His tears swept away the filth from Her body
and soul. A salvation for a creature
of Hell
No more children's snicker, no more games...
everybody's afraid of the Lady in Black...
"No longer She will be an un-dead of Evil.
She's a true dead of God, and Her soul is with Him!"Are you responsible?
For your deeds
Do you feel a presence of mights
That interfere in your life
Do you realize their value?
Who direct of your life?
Think about it now
When your life''s start
And seems so easyWe are the Cauldron of Puke and we'll steal your stuff
We're like the pirates who will steal your stuff yeah man!
We'll get inside your boat and then we'll steal your stuff
Cuz we're bad and stuff and we are sinister!!!
Bru Ha Ha!!
We are the ones who will steal all your stuff
and you will never see it again
Unless you go to the pawn shop
go to the pawn shop
Cuz we have stole your stuff!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

Cheese!!!!!i see the light and the spirit 
and those not in the book of life
no one knows about that day
not even the angels or the son, only the father
when the son of man comes in all his glory
and the angels with him
he will sit upon his throne
in heavenly glory

i tell you the truth
whatever you did not do
for one of the least of these
you did not do for me
then they'll be cast away to eternal punishment
but the righteous
gain eternal life

all the nations will be gathered
before him he will seperate
the sheep from the goats
the dead from those in Christ
then i saw a great white throne
and him who was seated upon it
and i saw the dead great and small
standing before the throne and books were opened

i tell you the truth
whatever you did not do
for one of the elast of these
you did not do for me
then they'll be cast away to eternal punishment
but the righteous
gain eternal life

(narration)
"another book was opened
which was the book of life
the dead were judged according 
to what they done as recorded in the books"

the sea gave up its dead
the grave and hades gave up their dead
and each person was judged
according to what they had done
then death and hades were cast
into the lake of fire
which is
the second death

i tell you the truth
whatever you did not do
for one of the elast of these
you did not do for me
then they'll be cast away to eternal punishment
but the righteous
gain eternal lifeHurry weave me an old crystal web
Spheres of glass fight with axes of lead
Orbs of eyes hands of fathers of eggs
Hearts of shitwire hangers of heads
Chase of fortunes chafing red thighs
Caustic scales female justice averred

Hum together O little angels
Little bees crying in mirrors of wax
Hum together sections of agriculture
Hum together battlers of valor

Twang together frothing with reveined eyes
Glossolaliac little Jews harps
Wagging tongues dance with throats of raw ululation
Drip from jowls ye hot drops of prey

Harmonia
Hum O bothered web

Pull the hinges out from under your door frames
Puff an honest cough from your chest
Bend gymnastic O supple children
Shear the wool from your innocent flesh

Harmonia
Throb with sex O heartless web

Hurry weave me an old crystal web
Spheres of glass fight with axes of lead
Orbs of eyes hands of fathers of eggs
Hearts of shitwire hangers of heads
Chase of fortune chafing red thighs
Mounted hips wrinkled old drippy eyesAn unfamiliar recollection begins to frequent me 
Of a life that I cannot recall 
I'm lumbering in the darkness, I'm clawing at the soil 
Twisting wildly as I make my ascent from the loam 

Contorting, retching 
Adapt to this form that's undoubtedly not my own 
Bereft of illumination 
A dark empire shall rise in this absence of light 

Torn from the sky upon this hollow sphere of dirt 
Exiled from the luminescent throne 
Undaunted, I engage in mutilation of the blinded congregation 
Of the Lamb, which bears the gilded cross 
That I have sworn to destroy 

I traverse the halls of the damned 
In temples of flesh and towers made from bone 
Beneath a blackened sky, I begin to build my throne 
Succeeding this sacrilegious devourment of the earthBlown in silence the pages unfold
gently the owner's possessions parade
untamed, they're forced to caress

Itch and burn the memories and ache

Twists the leaf and turns no wet
lifeless parody the motion, the theft
thge silent paradox
the deafening anxiety
is lust to come by my will?

The breath to choke
a gasp for death
bless the maze the holy mess
throbs my loneliness
bleed the ones to be and 
the spectral light embrace

Kiss the world goodbye
come the burial well
sublime the ecstatic gift
the crimson eyes 
the pale and pure disgrace
alights a sinful rest, the peace

Canvassed lies in mind the headlong play
awkward for a one-faced player
a blatant flop the plot
fails to forgive and it forgets
this is the grand ecstatic gift
is this just worth for human thing?

Itch and burn the memories and ache
the ecstatic giftYour stinking corpse I desire
nothing can take me higher
Fucking you till your bones break
Another one has to die

Come dripping from my dick
Fucking you to the core
Can't take this anymore
My brain is driving me insane

Necrolust

Eating the flesh of a thousand corpses
Bloodsucking cuntless nuns
her guts were boiling out of her butt
Eating her slimey cunt as I hold her tits

Come posercorpse and die again!Spoken Words:
Omens whisper in the winds of night 
As shadows march by serpentine light
Burning, following an impulse into the furnace
The serenity of self deception... an infestation
The indifference of good men 
Foretelling our doom as the ravens "afflight".

Lungs of hell... 
Burn the heavens 

Crosses bleed...

Pale skin shreddedI'd walk through hell and back again instead of fighting with you
I'd go through all the pain and suffering instead of living without you

I miss you more than ever, this is why I cry

'Cause you're the one I'm dreaming of tonight
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes - tonight
I would die for you - and you love me too
I won't be leaving you again
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes

I'd go through all the flames of hell again, just to get rid of the pain
And I'd live this madness once again, to show you it wasn't all in vain

Now I love you more than ever, this is why I cry

'Cause you're the one I'm dreaming of tonight
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes - tonight
I would die for you - and you love me too
I won't be leaving you again
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes

It wasn't me pretending, my love is never ending
I feel like dying when I see you cry
My mind is broken I know, but you shouldn't pay for my faults
I am sorry, please don't cry

'Cause you're the one I'm dreaming of tonight
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes - tonight
I would die for you - and you love me too
I won't be leaving you again
I swear there won't be any more goodbyesCat scientists obduct human corpses to gain knowledge about this strange and unfurry race. Furthermore they start to experiment with living humans and test new food and medical products.

All of the cat society agree to the use of humans for research. The human population gets worn out year by year; it seems they are near extinction.

Cat scientists are trying to improve the human reproduction to stop this trend. Humans are way to important for the production of food, health and beauty products. Human life is not worth a sip of milk.

Everyday hundreds of humans get executed 'cause they refuse to obey the real god. The almighty tiger.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)What if someone told you that a place exists
Where you can find yourself flying over hills
In the midnight sun
In the midnight sun

And what if life's mirror break up at your feet
And all that you can see are your real dreams
To the midnight sun
Ohh the midnight sun

So afraid, so much to care
So far away from my own fate
So confused when nothing seemed
To going on as I wanted

Every maze has its way out
Can't see beyond desolation
The door that led me to demise
Shows me the light of salvation

And
Now it's done
I'm living in the midnight sun
The battle is gone
The struggle is over

No more falls
I'm flying in the midnight sun
I knew was not wrong
I proved my convictions
And now I'm free

Going back to my past
Thunders hiting my head
The world is moving fast
My fear is growing up

Willing to disappear
Just for my own sake
I'm waiting for the end

But
Now it's done
I'm living in the midnight sun
The battle is gone
The struggle is over

No more falls
I'm flying in the midnight sun
I knew was not wrong
I proved my convictions
Now my destiny is frozen in time
Forever freeReassure my, security obsession 
Beneath column headers and appraisals 
Pages and pages to define 
The eclipse of averages 
Intently grinding in a circle 
Piece by...piece 
There's no joy on the nail head 
When the hammer hits. 

Dutifully hand over 
Or regularly confiscated 
A hit forfeited for a delusion 
Or extra paranoia insecuritySteal my trepidation, redress the balance
This cry of distress is a tripper into woebegoned
You wreak veangence on innocence to hold
This century is own impossibility

Forbidding anxiety walks through whole ending year
I saw my blood dying at the gate of insane heart
Forgery of your sense twisted vulgarism
That's exhausting me with untiring zeal

Theink about all the dreams you had
Don't regress to the impassive time
Think about all the things you hate
Don't try to find excuses
Think about invoke yourself
No blood into voracity
Think about relive my pain
No war I can ignore more

Join into my circus travel into my head
A price for solitude the victims of massive death

I choose to go over and past my anger2. Golden Leaf

And took his life 
Took him to the other side 
Can't you see his innocent past? 
No hiding from the unknown trap

The unknown trap

Innocence fades in with time

(From the unknown Trap
There's no turning back)(Instrumental)Every hero has a weakness... a dark persona or secret freakiness
A Waterloo or an Achilles' Heel... a hidden urge that they always feel
If I could pick a poison for myself... I would change my vice to something else
But I guess I'll be the same I've been since I was born;
One minute Dr. Jeckyll... the next I'm Mr. Thorn

Cuz every night... I get uptight... and have to fight... this feeling inside of me
I try... but I can't deny... that deep inside... their voices are calling me..........
I close my mind... but still I find... they're still inside... and every time
I hear that siren song... then I belong... to the Whores of Babylon

Built for speed... built for pleasure, the Ladies of Hades - Satan's treasure
The choice confection of my evil twin: debauched & depraved - concieved in sin
Nothing like a piece of young & tender meat - nothing else tastes quite so sweet
But even if it's served exactly right... I still can't eat the same thing every night

Cuz every night... I get uptight... and have to fight... this feeling inside of me
I try... but I can't deny... that deep inside... their voices are calling me..........
I close my mind... but still I find... they're still inside... and every time
I hear that siren song... then I belong... to the Whores of Babylon

And the Ladies of Hades sing:

La la... la la Lucifer. Ba ba... ba ba Beelzebub
Ma... Mephistopheles... yeeeeeaahhhh

La la... la la Lucifer. Ba ba... ba ba Beelzebub
Woah... yeeaaaah... Woah... yeaaahhhhh

They always lead me into temptation and into sordid sorts of recreation
If I give in. If I succumb, I'd never, ever, ever, ever get a damn thing done
Built for speed... built for pleasure, the Ladies of Hades - Satan's treasure
No matter what I do they won't leave me alone.
I changed my number then I finally had to disconnect the phone...

Cuz every night... I get uptight... and have to fight... this feeling inside of me
I try... but I can't deny... that deep inside... their voices are calling me..........
I close my mind... but still I find... they're still inside... and every time
I hear that siren song... then I belong... to the Whores of Babylon

Every night... I get uptight... and have to fight... this feeling inside of me
I try... but I can't deny... that deep inside... their voices are calling me..........
I close my mind... but still I find... they're still inside... and every time
I hear that siren song... then I belong... to the Whores of BabylonWhen the night releases the day
Which pushes cold in your nape,
you will hear this song,
before you flee into the night.

When the day makes him angry,
the night will be attacked from the troll,
you will smell his breath,
and creep finally on the ground.

formed by their Gods.
A part of the everlasting woods.

If the day expels the night,
In your mind the fear remains,,
this song, will fade away
before the crowd moves into the dark.

Trolls in big crowd will now sing
their song, quite oddly.

formed by their Gods.
A part of the everlasting woods.(Instrumental)I wake up screaming your name
Night after night I'm facing my shame

All in me is poisoned love
I can't believe I could go so low
All you preached cannot heal me now
I may bleed, I'll die somehow

You lied, you burned me alive, you fed
Yourself with my pain
You lied, you burned me alive, you fed
Yourself with my pain

How many times we sat down together
Talking to the wind and building our
future?

All in me is poisoned love
I can't believe I could go so low
All you preached cannot heal me now
I may bleed, I'll die somehow

You're the needle in my flesh
You're my wound

There was no hate in our summer nights
Only sweating skins while I took you
By the reins to ride

Killed me slowly
All in me is vengeance raw

RawPack the bong
Load the gun
Cut the line
Snort it up
We're going to the liquor store tonight
We're gonna blow some fuckin' heads offI'm chased by this plague
Live in the void
I am immune to this pain
Feeling nothing

My sight will fade, shadow appears
Enter the real, into forgotten years
Falling on my grave, surrounded by black
Tears are whispering, welcome back

Spreading my weak wings
My shattered heart says no
Still thinking  it's time to go
Cold is catching up, farewell

Angrily dying, avoid the bright
Look at the pain, my hands are shaking
No one to hold, to embrace me tight
Is this what I am dying for?

Once ambarked the void, dark turns to you
As the moon turns, to you
The lights will fade, my eyes will close
My weak eyes will close

This dreadful death is haunting me
The dying is dreadful
My soul will float away from here
I am dying, farewellDown here we are many you can not see us
But we are here we watch your every move
When we think its time we will bring you down

No one escapes us No one escapes us

The cross on your wall
Won't protect your soul
The bible by your bed
Will burn when you are dead
The time has come
To bring you down
Hell awaits
Come walk with us

We will bring you down
Here we are many you can not see us
But we are here we watch your every move
When we think its time we will bring you down

a root of analytical dialectics.
Philosophize, ratiocinate all nonsense
until my mind simulates pandemonium.

Morale, rationale came off unforeseen.
Idleness in the way we generate conjecture.
Downsizing expectations to the bitter end,
feeling trapped within this segmental aperture.

See the whole world revolving around me
while I found myself in a stationary struggle,
only to collapse without one single movement
as visions expanded beyond mental capability.

Die down in personal responsibility,
and I'm looking forward to it.It was in the winter of 1946 that Edgar von Chandeau, better known by his friends and close acquaintances as Mr. Chandy, finally decided to invent meat. 

It was during a most uneventful rugby game at the local townhouse, in which his interest for smoked pomegranate and knives was overcome by a surge of creative energy. 

Few ever questioned Mr. Chandy's penchant for design. However, meat was a most extravagant new frontier, and the prospect of actually eating it didn't agree with the local townsfolk's preferences. It was a ridiculous concept. It was a reddish pink, bloody, and very unpleasant to the nose. On the other hand, Mr. Chandy was sure of the success of his invention.

The actual production process was a secret, but his acquaintances were certain it involved a wooden ladle and a cheese grater at some point. Mr. Chandy, ever the gentleman, and ever the businessman, never revealed his original method, not even to his own children. 

For years, meat remained only as a curiosity to be sold and seldom consumed during boxing matches. Early on, Mr. Chandy's quite violent synthesizing technique left his product with the sweet taste of elongated bananas, and while the slippery, wet texture of meat was complemented by the sweetness, it simply couldn't reach the basic pillar meal status its creator had envisioned. 

It wasn't until 1932 that meat actually became a respected food item. Its creation, so calculated and precise, was the polar opposite to the way it eventually evolved. 

Mr. Chandy was hurrying back home from his local church, when his station-wagon malfunctioned and sent its passenger, and a large cargo of meat hurling, through a school and landing into a post office. This, of course, caused the meat to catch fire. 

The realization hit Mr. Chandy like a ton of meat - that, of course being, that meat had to be set on fire in order to be consumed. 

Nowadays, hundreds of people enjoy meat worldwide. Its refining process has changed a lot since Mr. Chandy's death in 1946, but the practice of setting it on fire for hours on end before eating it is still in use. Praised for its delicacy, the dry, sandy texture is a favourite in small children and the elderly. However, anybody can pick a taste for some good Mr. Chandy meat. Just don't mix it with bananas.Behold the man of pale flesh
Lost in eternal rest
The table full of food
Behold the only rule
Take my feast ill take your flesh
Tell your mind ill never rest
Hurry down the stairs hide in places
The eyes can't seeMy pulse is my mantra
The prayer oonly in my ears
The church bells of my body
Calling for swords and spears

Because this is the warpath
To the altar of sacrifice
Because this is the warpath
To crush these weak lies

Northern lights are blazing
Like the dragon under my skin
Downpour of heavy feathers
Can't hide the way of the kind

Winds of doubt and disbelief
Are washing my seekers eyes
But I travel through plasters casts
To destroy the inner idea of paradise

Because this is the warpath
To the altar of sacrifice
Because this is the warpath
To crush these weak liesHalucinogenocidal


Beneath the cold that surrounds us lie elements long forgotten, 
forces of nature not known by the disease. Colors, aspects, facets,
all unused by the plague. Oh if they had known... 
The wonders they could have created, the horrors they might have wrought.
Keys to birth, creation, existence. keys to decay and demise.

Life would never have died
Death would never have lived
We close our eyes, and then we die.

Light is darkness, darkness is god.
God is nothing, nothing is everything.
What is god?

God exists in the mind of man, 
and what is real if not the thoughts and will of a man?
Now tell me, are you real?

Above the blazing heat that entrap us
Looms that, what has always existed
The four, known and hated,
Cessridden, rotten.

The filth of fear and despair.
Deliric, dark, we abide their every word.
Never shall we be free, 
never will they free us.

The maw of impending nothingness
can never be quenched.
Decieve matter, betray the abstract.
trancendental unity, the grimness of being.

The final chapter in the tome of erosion has already been written,
all that remains now is to turn the page.
The comatose slumber must seize 
in order for the antidote for life to evolve.Jar Of Joy

Lord of all sorcery! I stand in your shadow..
Possess me with your names! To possess my spirit..
That i may be strong and true
Vanquisher of evil spells
Dark Angels.. Dead and dreaming
When shall.. Their generation come again
I am.. One of those lost ones
From a.. Time before the forging of gods
Cold rain.. Erodes my kingdom
Beloved Sons.. Render the ancient fires 
Loud roaring.. A bitter venom
They are.. Gibbering loathsomely below

I whom awaken him hath called fourth.. An ancient, burning pain
From a night as pitch as black and death.. Upon me, Upon himself
Of the generations of past burning fires.. Seven are they, They are seven
Amid the desolate places of earth they rise once more.. Like a flood, they 
ravage. I hath passed a torch of cataclysmic destruction upon this realm 
yet unknowned to me. And on the mountain of dawn they creep yet amid 
the desolate places of earth they crawl
The highest walls
The thickest walls
The strongest walls
They lie in wait
They wait for man
Not in that heaven
Nor on this earth
Men are arrayed in terror
All are screaming in pain
Crouching for the sacrifice
Falling like rain from the sky

- Serpents of the Skies - 2:41

They glide in the doors of all like slithering serpents
They enter through windows like the ever gusting wind
The haunts of all man where a sacrifice shall be offered
Upon the altar before the temple of the dead and dreaming
Of the last city of the skies i journey forward in cure
From places in the sky where no traveler hath returned
Upon the names of monsters made by those kings of all evil
I step fourth to the gates in spaces between realms of life
Upon the foundations of chaos
I hearken their habitations
Spirits of the skies hear me
Save us the cities of men
Watcher of the worlds! In the name of the covenant..
Last city of the skies! Opened wide the gates..
Lord of all sorcery! I stand in your shadow..
Possess me with your names! To save the realm of men..

Rather darkThe City in The Sea

Lo! Death has reared himself a throne 
In a strange city lying alone 
Far down within the dim West, 
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best 
Have gone to their eternal rest. 
There shrines and palaces and towers 
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!) 
Resemble nothing that is ours. 
Around, by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lieCursing my existence, hating place where I am now
Calling for resistance, slowly going down
Dancing flames are burning, making me insane
Winds of darkness howling, I'm in hell again

Pain is crushing me, in hopelessness I cry
Light I cannot see, better off to die
Instinct for survival replaced by a dream of suicide
Visions of disorder occupied my burning mind

Chorus:
The strongest one survives in the pack of wolfs
The weak one's sacrifice for the cruel lords

Running from the jaws in this satanic game
Now I learn to cause horror, death and pain
Black energy I breathe, so much harder to control
Lost my inner peace, slaughtering of soul

My lifetime is over I can feel my end
Lying on the ground, sword is in my hand
Sky is falling down, clouds turning gray
Hands of doom are taking me to hell again.(Instrumental)Wade waist deep into the emulsion
the freedom of a weakened mind
You revel in the innocence of singularity
While embracing the holy masses

Your armchair rhetoric and ignorance
Makes for strange bedfellows
With your search for enlightenment and knowledge
I see not but the weakest of minds

To pick and choose what suits your needs
While denying what was writ as modern cruelties
Does not make you a believer with the opiate masses
Yet fly high with your faith and your fear
So your fall may be long and fast and hard

To deny the natural law of life is absurd
To look around this world with faith in humanity
As the chosen prophecies of your absent deity
Fills me with the urge to defecate

The world of humanity lies in wait
While your beliefs hold us back from our true course
the tolerance of freedom for the mind
Abolishment of laws from centuries of distain

To see the world not as our own
But as 1 of billions of species of equal right
So with distain I look upon thee
In a mindset of attrition and absolute confidence
In what I know as fact and not as blind faith

Hold your head high in the clouds
Follow your Sheppard and be herded
Live life in constant hope of appeasing him
And constant fear that you have done him wrong

The lord as my Sheppard I shall not want
He maketh me lie down with blind obedience
He leadeth me into deception and intolerance
He corrupts the ideal of a soul, He steers me
From paths of righeousness in hie name's sakeAldi !
Iacta !
Est !Existence was a speckle of illusion in the midst of chaos. Everything has uncertainty, meaninglessness and emptiness in it and yet the illusion of certainty persists. It congregates itself into a ghastly vapor of cloud called form. From the fallacy that those illusions are forever and one, we claim authority. Authority; forgoing the fact that we perceive those forms differently, hence can never fully apply our experience to each other, yet we claim authority.
They used to sacrifice domestic animals to gods, and sacrifice was the most important support of cosmos. They thought because they slaughtered animals, their world was holding together. Now we sacrifice more than ever before, and animals suffer for all their lives to end up in our plates, and we torture each other and ourselves in a thousand ways. All of us partake in these religious and million meaningless sacrifices through the day and yet pass judgment from our moral high grounds.Come nearer, let me look at you! 
Absorb me, devour me, perish me! 
Rise from within, the unbound shade! 
Tempt me, caress me, dream in me! 

(I bet you know), immortal is not my flesh 
... and nor is yours... 
(I bet you know), forever we are not 
... none and no one... 

Aren't you in fear? 
Aren't you... my dear? 

Dive in, and beyond! 
Transintegrate, emerge and go away! 
Come out from oblivion! 
Fly away, forget and... 
Die at last!You could feel the end draw near as the days are getting hotter 
Burning out the time in line will lead us all to slaughter 
World is still just black and white, grey is all should be 
Ready now just let yourself be free 

Everything's one, Under the sun 
We've got to change the chemistry, do it here, do it now 
Set it off today 

Can you see the stars align as the Winds of Change are blowing
Time will take you by surprise without you even knowing 
One chance is all we get so let's do it right you see 
Come together here with me 

Breaking down the walls that hold us, aint no mystery 
Here today gone tomorrow, as it all should beOLD

Last scraps of wisdom
No at the mercy of liar
Matchless skill to decieve
The omnious destiny
Death, the spread of the unknown
Unimagine to scape unhurt

Nothing else
Than the dignity lost
Only loophole is destroy
Your enemies in your mind

Ilusions desapear
Emotions are building in fear

Nothing else
Than the dignity lost
Only loophole is destroy
Your enemies in your mindStrange face in a stone
and the river's moan is a voice.
The hidden family in wilderness.
The forest is restless.
There's weeping in the boughs and I hear it.
Crows shrieking above and sudden winds blow.
A wailing wind blows.
The evening, the gloaming, the Night.New vermin blood in old vermin skin 
 That true secret whispered to a fence of reeds 
 Driven over the bones of the dead 
 Repetition like a curse 
 Ice moving across the earth 
 Tangled within a feedback loop 
 Worms in spacetime 
 Knotted by habit 
 What shapes do we express? 
 We are the damned, damned by the will to liveI welcome you my audience
Feel free, and enjoy the last of a trilogy
This is my last work and it is also my hope,
To remain for,a long time in your remembrance
Let me introduce  to you, a collection of sound-scapes,
Which are for me a particular event
This will probably be the last time you heard of me
You are listening to the third of a trilogy
Call me a wimp, call me what you want
Call me, just call me
I also want to explain you,
That i will never do twice the same
That's the reason for i invite you
To my kind of musical entertainment
This will probably be the last time you heard of me
You are listening to the third of a trilogy
Call me a wimp, call me what you want
Call me just call me
I welcome you my audience
Feel free, and enjoy the last of a trilogy
This will probably be the last time you heard of me
You are listening to the third of a trilogy
Call me a wimp, call me what you want
Call me, just call meAnd we march on through the frigid night, 
In the shadow of our forefathers, we brave the Winter's might 
Soldiering across this barren land to where we'll join our kin 
And resist the invading warriors of Christendom who're threatening 
To destroy our very way of life 

Lay siege to the cross 
Don't let them gain upon your ground 
Fight to defend your clan 
Cut every last one of them down 

...before they kill us all 
And put our women and children to their swords and burning stakes 
And raze our temples and destroy our lore, our tales of old 
Traditions handed down for eons, from the bards, we're told 
We must not let this be our fate.Well, if he's an enemy combatant not a prisoner of war
Then it's a sling not a chain if Geneva asks anymore
While you save the world I'm gonna sit here and get paid
So keep it to yourself no matter what I say

Hey, you is the left still with me?
Hey, you is the right still with me?
You gotta watch what you say in this paranoid age
Gonna take you downtown to Guantanamo Bay

There's a lot of debate about my ulterior agenda
Conspiracies and propaganda
Just stay the course while the pipelines are built
We'll get what we want while they live in filth

Because article 3 is all the lovin' you get from me
Article 3
Who am I kidding anyways?

Hey, you is the left still with me?
Hey, you is the right still with me?
You gotta watch what you say in this paranoid age
Gonna take you downtown to Guantanamo Bay

Are my people still with me?
Are you still with me?
Did he not resign yesterday?
They're dropping like flies without being tried
And their held down in Guantanamo Bay

Baby you want to much from me
And I can't give it
If you wanna be free
Well there's a price for every freedom

Because article 3, now that's the kind of lovin' you get from me

Horror
Embraces the lost soul,
Noises
Prey upon the brain,
Cold eyes that bury the truth
In the Domain of the Damned.These columns rising above the Blue Ridge
into the bright, crisp skies

the steam is rising past the pine tops

Sins and transgressions have been washed away
In every parish and precinct, you can hear em pray
Them Osburn boys, pray they don't get pinched
This towns forgiven, cleansed of all our sins

In these hills and up the hollows
this town is living off the weakness of men
many of them have lost their lives here
buried 'neath this foggy mountainside
into this fog the smoke is rising

Sins and transgressions have been washed away

See em run through the fog
Taste the virgin shine

Tearing at the night sky 
She trails to the edge 
The tellurian verge of this world 

Through boiling seas 
Burning black earth 
Bottomless chasms 

Tending her wound 
Shielding her heart 
Together, apart 
She's nearer to the white stone 

At last 
Transgressing the 
Emanation 

Withered and swamp-bathed 
A shroud on the world 

Offal and butchery 

Claw at her wounds 
Rending her heart 
Pulling apart 
Until she's bare 

The firmament screams the song of longing 

The petrified corpses 
She must climb 

A billion passions through time 
Canonized on this stone 
Carved in killing order 

To see beyond it she must climb 
A monument to tragedy 

To see beyond it she must climb 
She will fall 
She must fall 

Elytrous spine 
Structures align 
Taunting her will to ascend 

As she traces 
The flesh of the stone 
Constellations of names 
Carved of no hand 
Connected by fate 
All there's been and will be 

Webbed are the names 
Connected by grooves 
Knowledge and memory, truth 
She knows that it is a lie 

She must climb 

The name of her father is there 
Her mother, insane 
Her brother is there 
Stillborn 
Impostor in her place 

An endless voyage through time 
Built the horror of this stone 
Impostor 
Impostor 

To see beyond it she must climb 
A monument to tragedy 

Dead, in his place 
In his place 
In her place 
She was born 

For every time you've been a coward 
For every mollified excuse 
For every time you've stood for nothing 
Construing justice for the truth 

You were there 
Your name was there 
You were there 
And she must climb 

With your silence she's been scarred 
And your cruelty remains 
Your name is there 
Your name is there 

You are there 
You are there 
And she must climb 
She has to climb

We came at him with our sk8boards
He got a Pop Shove-It to the lip
I did a McTwist and landed on his wrist
And knocked the rifle right out of his grip

He had one more trick up his sleeve
A smoke bomb he quickly deployed
Once again he escaped, but not before getting scraped
A pastime we've come to enjoy

We sk8ed back to the graveyard in a rush

[february 2013 - october 2014]Why is it so weird touching your skin
It is cold and wet and shirking
Why do you stare at me like that
I ain't done you any harm

You remind me of a fish
Slippery, primal and stupid
Why do you stare at me like that
I ain't done you any harm

Crawl back
To where you came from

You smell of dust, are you alive?

Crawl back
To where you came from

Why is it impossible for me
To find someone normal
Why do I have this capacity
For attracting creatures
From below

Then you have me and I feel death
Imminent it is mine own

You will soon disintegrate
In a single pile of dust on the floor

Crawl back
To where you came from
 
You smell of dust, are you alive?

Keep your fucking hands off of me
Drag your bones back to your hole
Don't let me ever see you here again
Or your ghastly sunken skull

Crawl back
To where you came from
 
You smell of dust, are you alive?

my hatred is what I see! 
Mirror-image of myself! 
I break it as if it was me! 
The shards cut my skin 
Emptiness enraptures me 
Pieces fall to the ground! 
This reflection is turning black!

Breaking the spell of time, 
the boundaries of reality. 
I bury the secret deep within,

Force-feeding me over the years

Still you want me to believe,

You cannot take my hatred from me! 
You can try, pray to the sky 
In the end you all will die!

Now justice has been dealt 
This is your fucking end!

Now I am in the mirror 
The reflection enraptured me! 
Blackness is only left behind 
The reflection becomes me!

The reflection became me 
Pitch black to the core 
Over time the shards disappear, 
but my hatred is here to stay, 
you cannot take this from me! 
I bred my hatred for eternity! 
You may be able to take my life, 
but you cannot take my hatred from me!

The agony has been drained from these wounds! 
The flesh has been torn from the body! 
Nothing but hatred is left inside.. 
And.. 
YOU CANNOT TAKE MY HATRED FROM..

IX. GUITARMAGGEDONIt's as if men could only ape the language of god
Debase and brutalize his song,
But when sorcerers sing men die!

Rend the flesh from the bones
licking clean the bloody wake
feast on the filth
and plot to burn heavens gates

I listen to the torment cries
as they echo through the air
set fire to thy enemies
take heart unto their screams

Shivering in ecstasy
I'm bathing in their agony

Roiling in the ashen ground as Arafel hath done
I harken to the silent screams of victims yet to come.

Lead me to the demons shrine
of he who dwells in night
with him dwell in endless bliss
and taste of his great might
bring now forth the sacrifice
with weeping wounds and hateful eyes
Call upon the spider god
of blackest flame, and purest blood.

Come hither my almighty beast
Do your masters will
Devour these pathetic men
And savor every kill

Summoned from a black abyss
where chaos rules with night
child of Demogorgon
Shall feast with great delight

Let swing the blades of slaughters past
Let rise the morning star
For he-who-hungers-for-the-flesh
Does love his bloodied child

(Mad cackling laughter with the occasional 'yessssssss!')

Wards flicker and fade away
as songs bring men to their knees
Scoring fields of all life
Hearing not the screams
The song sings him
a lifeless husk
and all life simply fades
Away.




_____________________________

Initially this began as the story of a man who's family was burned at the stake after he fled into the wilderness after declared a heretic. This was not the case but the extremism of the church and his lust for the destruction of those who wronged him drove him into dark pacts with being's from outside gods creation which both drove him mad and gave him godlike power. He eventually summoned one of these beings into the earth and laid waste to the town of his birth, the inquisition and all those he encountered, until at last his soul was absorbed into the outside.

The primary source of inspiration is historical satanism in Europe, who were said to turn to Satan in the face of the corruption and tyranny of the church. A microcosm of the fact that we as a society create our own worst enemy.

I drew from many mythologies and figures in the story of this song.

Arafel is the fog covering the world in the apocalypse, twisting over the scorched earth. Demogorgon who has become a demon of Christian mythology but was consdered as a corruption of the demiurge. A dark twisted reflection of God in many senses, considered the supreme being of the threefold world. From a literary perspective he is used by John Milton in Paradise lost not as a demon, but as a being from outside existence in realm where chaos rules with night. His name itself is said to be a curse. Milton's Demogorgon is closest to the one of my imaginings and is a good representation of the forces invoked by my sorcerer within the song.

Lastly their is some influence once more from R. Scott Bakker. In that my descriptions of the practice of magic beings songs and wards as well as the opening part of the song which is a direct quotation from his work.I've got a bad case of DU sickness. It feels as if my body has turned against me.
Still the government wont take responsibility for diseasing and killing with depleted uranium used in combat weaponry!
The U.S. must take responsibility for DU sickness before more must die.Christian panic burning church
These tombs should be profaned
You're a freaky bastard, 
Prepare and pray!
Your god will not forgive all your sins

The end is near, death in tortures, 
Your head is strewed by ashes,
Demonic suffering in a satan's flame!

Nasty ship, you was born silly and blind
And so you shall to die!
Learn a fatal precept now!
Learn a fatal precept now!
Learn a fatal precept now!
Die! amen!In the darkness of the woods
Like the stone, stone roots
Morbid palace of the fate
It's my land
Too much years for a one night
Just a moment of a light
Kissing bleeding Christ to his ass
It's happiness

Look through my eyes to the void
Are you afraid of the dark?
Stupid and scanty growd
It is all for you

In the rumble of the end
My nation will be dying first
Ugly creatures with no hearts
Just no hearts

Dark messenger takes me away
He will bring fire while you bring rain
And let it burn, let it death
Let it turns to ancient stone

What have you done with unfortunaite land?
Mother Russia I can see your grief
I can see your tears I hear your scream
The son of godless fatherland must have no dream
All of you bastards I don't like, look out!
The eyes of death will follow you, look out!
you can see my tears you hear my scream
The godless fatherland must have no dream(Instrumental)From the Earth minds are wondering
How could this great universe runs so well
Space and time, both follow the order
It makes us to think who's behind such things

Hail to the forests...
for they are the lungs of Earth
Hail to the mountains...
for their amazing scenery

Look down into the smaller scale of reality
These living beings, exist to occupy our planet
The biological orders within our own bodies
They make us to think who create such things

Hail to the oceans...
for they bring the majestic waves
Hail to the rivers...
that keep flowing until the call
of The Last

"I am the Alpha and the Omega
... who is, who was, and who is to come
The Almighty"

It would take faith
to believe there was a process of creation
It would take more faith
to believe there's a coincidental existence

The quest for reason
keeps compelling my thoughts and my emotions
Towards the fact
That there is an existence of a Higher Being

I bow to the Source of universe
The Creator of all things seen and unseenThis gravehill stinks of death
A reek from the ground
Catches whiff of the hound
A dead ones breath
The casket lid is cold
Waiting inside
Is someone petrified
That odours old

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving messiah

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood

Son of god

The bitter taste is sweet
So eat nazarene
And you kiss the obscene
Anointed feet

Your hands held high
Brothers of Metal
Thousand fists to the sky
Side by side
With iron and steel
Side by side
Fighting for Metal that is real

Sons of the damned, We will win the fight
(Sons of the damned)Energies stolen by the unseen
Filter the knowledge every dead moment
Nameless enemies that have no soul
Keeping you outside the wisdom

Masses poisoned with endless flood
Swim in their shit to strengthen their blood

Called by the others by names of the others
They think you have ego that can be harmed
Sense the pulse of hidden society
Ever present and never proven

Masses poisoned with endless flood
Swim in their shit to strengthen their blood

Even your allies are all misled
Born fed slaughtered in light nonexistent

Fairytale saviours not to be trusted
We walk through the jungle of prophets untrueIn Arpil I waited for the Easter Bunny
And when He came it sure felt funny
In July I stayed up waiting for George Washington
Who spilt his seed prematurely on my thumb
And in October the Jack-o-Lantern came by
And made my bedroom smell like pumpkin pie
November was exciting but all my friends were shocked
When I slept with all the Pilgrims of Plymouth Rock
And in December, Santa put me to the test
But I did what he said and I quickly got undressed
Now it's January and I'm pressed up to the window pane
Wishing and hoping but is it all in vain?
It's January, Jesus, January's here
When will you show up and pop me in the rear?
Jesus, having sex with you is never scary
But please don't make me do it with Joseph and Mary!Bad religions singing.

Killer and Destroy.When fear is created by pain
Then your life is covered in dark shrouds
Feel the despair, sorrow and rage
For fill the signs that were written in blood

Broken by my sins, I am dying for my freedom
Left alone, in this world of disillusions
Dressed to mourn in name of divine insanity
Scarred by your voice, my tears will never die

Enslaved by the lights of darkness
I created my own cursed world
I am the keeper of lost souls
In despair I shall burn

When fear is created by pain,
Then your life is covered in dark shrouds
Feel the despair, sorrow and rage
For fill the signs that was written in blood

Banned for my thoughts, by the hand of insanity
Chained for life, preparing for eternity
Kissed by flames, damned forever
Touched by your breath, sleep..

I will never(Instrumental)This broken arrow points to nowhere 
Close ended, clusterfucked and emotionally plowshared 
Glove compartments and paper clipped files 
Conjugated heart can't even sigh. 

Tapping catheter in rolling black out grids 
Survey the blood, a labor of old 
To what end do you pyramid? 

Another entry in the phone book 
With paperwork always a given 
Every form filled out in triplicate squared 
Intense pacing of attrition 

Inside out 
Of a digitally retouched identity 

A choppy ending 
With synch sound rekeyed 
Foreshortened autonomy 
I reciprocate beat.Fashioned by humans
But no longer serves
Any honorable purpose

Though vaporized
Psyche plasmasized
Shielded sound molecules
Yielded irregular modules

Corrupt alien tool

Up from tyranny
We will fight

Secretly subdued

Republic of Texas(Instrumental)Hunt the shade through the endless night
Cross a black cemetery
Do you remember the ancient spell
A wizard laid on your mind
But beware his view - don't look in his eyes
If you're listening to me I can give a sign to run away

Child of hell

Huge black gates with their wrought iron wings
Open at the horizon
The skies are tumbling as you smell the breeze
Now it's too late for warnings
You will pass one gate to the endless pain
You don't hear my warning, you don't look for the sign to
Run away.

Child of hell

Now you have to face hell's scenery
With its immortal pain
Henceforth till the end of the world.
And you're the servant of prince Lucifer
Everlasting harm is the lot you got
And in hell, you know, it is much too hot for runaways

Child of hell

Thunder lightning rain and hale
But your face did look so pale
The thunder's torturing your ears
Eyes are gleaming in the night
Beaming out unholy light
A sign that means your death is near
With your poisoned mind you cannot tell just right from wrong 
Blinded eyes by burning fire that's moving on
All repentance comes too late, you can't stop by
When you take a look in his unholy eye

I can't blame you for your deeds
'Cause I know how strong the need
Is for your mind your heart your soul
But expect no mercy now
Because I can't tell you how
You can escape the devil's hand

Don't you see your fate is sealed there's no return
From hell
That the seed of evil changed your mind with a
Mighty spell
You're his faithful servant in every case an order came
Till I clean your heart by the power of the holy fireYour soul shall be my soul
Your mind shall be my mind
Your will shall be my will

I am the Nature you deny
I am the God from whom you hide
I am the chaos that comes from within

I am the Nature you deny
I am the God from whom you hide
I am the chaos that comes from within

Into your veins my serpent sneaks
Out of your mind your logic leaks
You shall be free from the fear of sins
Just follow the Beast rising from the abyss

Your thoughts shall be my thoughts
Your words shall be my words
Your way shall be my way

I am the thirst in search of blood
I am the whole brutality
I am the one you call insane

I am the thirst in search of blood
I am the whole brutality
I am the one you call insane

Into your veins my serpent sneaks
Out of your mind your logic leaks
You shall be free from the fear of sins
Just follow the Beast rising from the abyss

And you shall be as me
And you shall live as I demand
In the thousands of my worlds

My altar bleeds with sacrifice
Shall bring me heaven which was mine
And I shall cover it with ice

My altar bleeds with sacrifice
Shall bring me heaven which was mine
And I shall cover it with ice

So strong is my will
To hunt and to kill
Kneel down in the light
Of my glory's blight

The strength of my horde
Can smash every word
And conscience-proof
They move

Thrones - your leaders bone
Fear is my seed
Under your feet
My treat

A wall of your thrones
Revered heads and bones
It is mine alone
The crown

I bathe in my own sin
I will wade into bloody lakes
I make myself immortal, and then
When everyone is enslaved
I shall reign a thousands of years

In the face of this wall
I will rule an crush you all
On you knees maggots folk
With you scum i will not talk

Recaida!The party's kicking off, everyone is over there 
You came on your own, you clearly don't care 
What anybody thinks, or what you like to drink 
By the end of the night you'll be praying to the sink 
Mouth wide open 20 beers in your brain 
Falling on the floor, downing trampagne 
Smashing through walls and stomping down stairs 
Let's rip this place apart let's see who dares 

Case of beer in your hand 
Mischief in your mind 
Anybody in your way 
Will surely fucking die 

Been drinking your way to an early grave 
Supping that shit, a white cider slave 
Hitting on every girl that walks into this place 
Her boyfriend says 
Fuck off or I'll kick you in the face
Grab another bottle and swill it down your neck 
Get up to take a piss and hit the fucking deck 
So much booze is running through your veins 
Foaming at the mouth, about to go insane 
Police have crashed in, through the front door 
Bowl of vodka jelly smashed on the floor 
Vacant mindless stare legs are giving way 
Words are in your mouth but they can't fucking spray 
Vision goes red, blood pouring down 
Mace and bloody truncheon, beaten to the ground 
You may have won the war but there's no need to hate 
Cause all I wanna do is drink, thrash and skate 

White Fucking Storm, GO!(Instrumental)Welcome to this endless nightmare
You can't escape
Darkness begins to consume you
Succumb to fate
Eternities of endless torture
Won't compare to this
This is a one time show
You won't miss

This isn't easy, I hope you know
The misery will not let go

I'll endure
Run no more
Win the war
And I'll
Haunt your dreams
Fill your screams
Bow to me

Close your eyes, let the fear sink in
Embrace your doom
Sit down and stay for a while
Why leave so soon
When I am through with you
You'll wish for death
My name will forever haunt
Your every breath

This isn't easy, I hope you know
The misery will not let go

I'll endure
Run no more
Win this war
And I'll
Haunt your dreams
Fill your screams
Bow to Me

Oh god, what have I done?
I have no soul
The monster inside has awoken
And taken control
What to do with this guilt
I haven't a clue
Forgive me for I know not
What I do

SOLO: RippeThere's really nothing in this world I would crave for
The fears and my nightmares are becoming real 
more and more
Every glance I take is of pure winter
And every little rose is black in the heart of mine.

Angel stabbed with the fearless bravado...

Once I risked scary wink to somebody
Dealt out the cards of threat to society.
Ones that dwell in this bale of calamity
Forced to feed mouths of lie with absurdity.

Life's but a dream...

One second paranoia, disappointment
Sinister dialetics, despondency
Lamentable living standards, disdain
Responsibility - diminished

Sitting in the room of no fraternity
Contemplating in NDE
I observe the kaleidoscope
Of twisted human eugenics

Psychical hermitage
Born of vital exhaustion
I drink from the bowl of abhoration
To greet another fascination

No call o' mine shall on these wastelands recognized be
On deserts pulsating not

From abandoned grave
Am I ever to escape?
My blood has run out
Never I am to awakeNightfall, and you head to the show 
A ticket is clutched in your hand
Wearing a vest made of denim 
With patches of your favorite bands
You get to the club
And the first band is totally lame 
These posers are into the nu-school
They have t-i-o-n in their name!

Our riffs decapitate them, our solos shred their skin
My drums obliterate them, let the massacre begin!!!

Up from the pit
We launch an assault on the stage 
Hatchets are buried in craniums
In a frenzy of psychotic rage
Killing machines 
Necks are all broken and slashed
We came here to conquer, we came here to rule 
WE CAME HERE TO SPLATTERTHRASH!!!!!

Our riffs decapitate them, our solos shred their skin
My drums obliterate them, let the massacre begin!!!

SPLATTERTHRASH!!! BANG YOUR FUCKING HEAD!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! SLAY THE LIVING, EAT THE DEAD!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! MOSHING LIKE A FOOL!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! LIVE FOR METAL, DIE FOR GHOUL!!!

End of the show 
And on to the next shitty dive

Count down together now
And say the words that you will learn

To the fate of lice

A DEAL'S A DEALThe colours merge into one form
The voices calling me to join them
I leave this world through a tunnel
A tunnel of light and shapeless forms

What are these words that I'm hearing?
I can't make sense of any of them

My sense tingle, my skin is crawling
The real world becomes more real
The visions I see soon engulf me
Spinning in and out again

Entheogenic ritual
guides me to a higher plane
I have become so much more
Than the sum of my seperate parts
Past memories
And sensations of motion
Unexplainable
Merging and becoming objects
Overlapping realities

Diviners Sage

I have become
One with the universe
Filled with insight
And a lust for life
Each journey goes deeper
Than the last
Closer to becoming
One with the GodsStrong man stands, I won't stand abused
Be off the streets, watch everyone

Don't be fooled, by false security
You're weak
Hands are tightening
Around your throatPut on your mask 
Keep it all buried inside 
It's time to implode 
Immerse yourself in doom 

Implosion 
Wither away 
Burst inward 
Wither away 

A great tribulation 
Drains the life out of you 
Triggers your anger 
And all that lies within 

Obliterated 
Dreams that turn to dust 
Disintegrated 
Of life force deprived 

Malignant parasite 
Shows no compassion 
And now all will perish 
'Tis the path to self-destruction 

Implosion 
Wither away 
Burst inward 
Wither away 

Your memories fade 
You're on the edge 
Try to hold on 
Cover up your pain 

Overcome it

Don't let it cast the shadow

taste of dying world

You refuse to believe but it's true
The gloomy days are coming
The old and rotten world must die
It's time has gone... that is the end

Blow the winds! Increase the power of fire
Blaze the old world! Vanish
under the stratum of ashes
Shake, tremble the earth!
Destroy towns and cities
Set in the Ocean! Take up
the thickness of ground

There will no people, the dead Gods
And their lying prophets
The light go out of millions of fires
Will dissolve in the eternal darkness
Blow the winds! Increase the power of fire
Blaze the old world!
Vanish under the stratum of ashes
Shake, tremble the earth!
Destroy towns and cities

Your temple was built on lie
It blinds with its pomp
But behind it a lot of dirt
And garbage, that can't be cleaned
You refuse to believe
but it's true
The gloomy days are coming
The old and rotten world must die
It's time has gone... that is the end
By damnation, ashes and the eternal fire
Make the craven people bow to you

And feed your greedy bellies
I scorn you
I'm dead for your lie
You hear, I'm dead and I'm in paradise
But my Eden is your hell
My victory is your death
You hear, my victory is your death

My happiness is your trouble
My freedom's your captivity
My light is dark for you
My paradise is your hell

Rage, my way, the ultimate guideline 
My desire is the kill 

As I point my gun to your head 
I feel your weakness, feel total control 
I pull the trigger, you fall down dead 
Once again I have fulfilled my death obsession 

I'm a hunter, you are my pray 
As I force my rage to ignition 
Midnight crimes is my vision 

As I point my gun to your head 
I feel your weakness, feel total control 
I pull the trigger, you fall down dead 
Once again on my raids across the nation, fulfill my death obsession

I've killed once, now it's been a thousand times
Without a warning you won't resist
My finger on the trigger, the look in your eyes
In rapture, I kill again
My quest for atrocities, on the edge to ecstasy
Keeps me alive and awakens my thirst
Still something is missing, yet not complete
I need to taste the sweet of my own blood 

Obsessed by violence, I'm possessed by evil 
Death, the way, my one satisfaction 
My desire is to die 

As I point the gun to my head 
I feel weakness, I'm out of control 
I pull the trigger and fall down dead 
Once again I have fulfilled my death obsessionharmony solo

Victims of a roadside murder buried where they fell no one near to hear the screams no one left to tell, a shallow grave marks the spot where parts of the dead find rest stabbed in the throat tongue cut out slowly bled to death, 

Quietly tucked deep inside devouring bodies any size.The world is turning, reaching its end
And the end is moaning, birthing the cold
Scarred skin transforming, the frozen flare, sleepwalking
I stand in silence, the brother of trees
We drop our garments, naked we dream
Scarred skin transforming, the frozen flare, sleepwalking
Night frost is melting, sliding away
I'm still standing, finding the way
Pathways like veins, desecrated landscape
Needle nails of the trees, acrid wine of the wintry grapes
This wind is carving my flesh like a knife
Roots, barks and branches, the nature's might
Here on the highest mountain with the highest birches
I'm awake and observing, waiting for the end to comeSweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'.

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas,
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'.

Sweet Dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas,
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Challenge the very essence of sanity,
By constantly shifting normality.
To you I am a clown dancing alone,
But I am a conductor of the stars

In the land of Fog, I am King.
The Lord of my own creations.
Will you pass the gatekeeper and come in,
To hear my inane proclamations?

Strip the truth bare, see it naked and cold.
See it in perspective to where you are.
"But remember the orbital transcendance illusion"
By the time you've seen me, I'm gone.

Forever passing to the land of Fog,
Shooting stars are the glints of my heels
There is thunder at the door waiting to come in,
I should go now to answer its call.

'Sky surfing stars in a sea of everness.
Their screeching breaks, echoing in the blackness.
They turn and gather, flying flends of hell.
Trying to trap you in their webs of doom!'
When stating destinations, the price must be paid.
To pass the test of time, through which the mind is decayed.

Caught now in my own shrunken world,
The transmission's broken down.
Danger sirens are echoing from within,
Only time will tell if I get back home.
The key to unlock insanity is hanging from the stars...
 
Caught now in my own shrunken world,
The transmission's broken down.
Danger sirens are echoing from within,
Only time will tell if I get back home.

The key to unlock insanity is hanging from the stars...he's older than all of you combined
he cant be killed by conventional weapons
Keith Richards ate disturbed
mushroomhead are next
hail the kingYou lost the reason why to live
Hunched under the burden of blame
Your mind and nonsensicality reproaches
Raped by alien opinions

Run away ahead their look
Needless crippled and killing
Absolute suspense about your life

Too much violence and informations
Why to die, why to live?
Run away ahead their look
Needless crippled and killingJust a matter of human nature?
Surviving through pure willpower
Removal of soul that could overcome you
Like there's anything to control at all...

Blood ain't a privilege
And the dead can't blame anyone
But all this contempt
Just to feel the recoil

Just a voice of honour compels all life
Beast is inside of failing abnormal parasite
ouch of revulsion or warmth of man
Sickening, suffering, ageless terraforming
And songs are written once again
Devil was there, god was there watching
(Bones fight the soil,
Bones devour the soil)
Say what thou wilt, grow holding no guilt
Regret is what causes every falling flesh filth
Where creativity turns into lunacy
Not a single man survived
(Survived!)

Blood ain't a privilege
And the dead can't blame anyone
But all this contempt
Just to feel the recoil

Just a matter of human nature?
Balancing existence as only reason
Time will forget again it all
Even bones fail to prove anything

(Bones fight the soil
Bones devour the soil)
And we are ready to face it all
We are ready to face it all
Our fallOhhh you're right.. youre right..
Come in now, dont leave anyone alive
Ohhh,, you're right, dont lay down
Dont let them end life, take flight 
Ohhh, dont end life 
My life, your life, dont let this fall away.
Gi Joe is coming for you
You know why Joe is coming for youFaces pillaged of expression 
Homogeneous nuclear family units 
Holed up in external as public eye sees fit 
Vaccinated against free will 

Self-deluded by our nature 
Or the blank scope of ourselves? 
Screening decisions-integrity cremated 
Chaperoned orientation to fiscal 

Better homes and gardens or killing fields 
A deeper sense of nothing, of alienation. 

Negotiate self as target 
Of assimilation 

Controllability of linear people 
Autistic configuration of a cohesive identity 
Inarticulate posture 
Only serves to undermine self-determinationSeeking to possess the one thing that may be able to end his cursed existence, Baron Samedi is permitted an audience with the Basilisk. As the Baron's pitiful story unfolds, the Basilisk sees an opportunity... 

The Mark of Voodoo 

Born on a slaver in sixteen sixty six 
I was cut from the womb 
Of a screaming West African witch 
In Haiti they laid me upon the auction block 
And I sold for a song on a Port-au-Prince dock 

Raised by the Houngan, he taught me the rites 
I saw him murdered one terrible night 
Found at his side, covered in gore 
Beaten and kicked, thrown to the floor 

Dragged to the slave house 
Tied down in a circle of chalk 
Ritual candles anointed 
With the blood of a sacrificed cock 
The frenzy was building 
I pleaded with them for my life 
They cut out my heart with a sugar cane knife 

I opened my eyes to the dark of a grave 
My body was rotten, my thoughts were depraved 
Walking the Earth for eternity 
Cursed with the duties of Samedi 

I spoke to the dead as their flesh decayed 
They spoke of a skull in a land far away 
To Creepsylvania via Bombay! 
End this curse! 

Solo Digestor 

Make these gruesome torments cease 
Give me the glory of deathly peace 
Put to rest these cursed bones 
"You'll find what you seek in the catacombs"the 12 signs don't align as they scurry cross the sky
70 or more are simply forgotten
what's this 13th sign? honored only for his plight
interpreting the dreams of those around him

as we look up to the sky so high
we correlate our lives with the night
as we calmly lie each night
serpentarius we try

the eagle made his way to strike him down and end his days
pluto wielding a great bolt of thunder
he chose to raise the dead healing sick with serpent hands
robbing hell of it's due souls heading under

answers that we search inside to find
reveal themselves to us causing fright
as we slowly die each night
serpentarius we try to find the light

as we live our separate lives no ties
the universe survives spanning time
as we calmly lie this night
serpentarius we die to find the light(Instrumental)When I came to this city, the highway lined with colors
Red, white and blue, with green and purple food wrappers
You can come and see, or live here with me
Mary Poppins played here; it was not the premiere
But we were there, Faxed Head, high on glue
Pregnant with desire, to see her on our proud screen
A Christian runs the BP, a man of peace, he helped me
He brought a flower to my bed
At the hardware store, good cheer
As I buy some epoxy cement
I love what I see, thank you glue.
In spring, at Burger King, they put up orange banners
In December, they put up red
In their parking lot, I shot myself
As I bled into my can of glue
I felt a communion with my hometown.We sacrifice all day, everyday, everything for reasons we cannot really altogether comprehend. Yet we still think our means will lead to ends and fanatically support our ways from moral high grounds. Every single person is still religious to the core and it is jihad everyday everywhere.
She does not pretend to care if animals nor humans die or plants are lost and this world goes to shit, she is more concerned with how she ended up in such a place. Just like everybody else really, but she is conscious therefore anti-religious. She does not think of forms she thinks of destruction.
She loves to do things out of spite, she feels pleasure from offending everyone for she sees them walking on the street with blood all over their hands from the lives lived in expense of others, the hearts they break. Yet still passing judgment. She believes in absolute immorality, but she is no worse. She likes black metal because it celebrates a great suffering; she likes to see suffering in art because she feels extreme sensitivity in sensitive artists expressing extreme insensitivity.
She hates getting censored and judged for her extreme art because she is just portraying the world as she sees it. These people eating their filet mignons of an animal that suffered all its life, and died upside down slaughtered then coming and saying she is wrong because of her subject matter. These people go home and hurt their kids, they hurt everyone and everything, yet pass judgment like they are pure, and this causes great pain for her.
She knows she is evil just like everybody else, a child molesting, rapist, torturous murderer, but she is conscious therefore anti- religious. She does not think of dichotomies, she thinks of suicide.Beneath this skin breathes an exhausted  and fragmented man deterioration escalates from outside ultimately regrettable behavior he murmurs and decrepitly utters the solitary name of his past questions unfurl in the open mind on the topic of revision of another judgement sways as open hands reshape into closed fists appreciation disregarded his hands once brought forth refuge and soundness now to only be spit on and belittled without logical reasoningProwling over wires, 
Petrified silicon, and mortar 
Skirting kinsmen with their monuments and emblems 

Openings structured by sparks, flies, and dust 
Relieving garrulous tribes of their honour - 
Their entrails of self-worth 

Approaching by way of driplines 
Drawn by viscera 
Throbbing dendritic formations 
Carry my sorrow 

Discerning viscous mucous - 
Remnants of the past 
Adapting as did the edaphobites 
To the cave's erosion 

Galleries deep underground 
Will adorn my being 
Tower karsts converge to cradle 
The cavity's core 

Underneath my feet 
The hidden dark zone 
Compelled to retreat 
All the wires part 

In the center of this remote cave 
I arise as venom from springs 

Galleries deep underground 
Will adorn my being 
Tower carsts converge to cradle 
The cavity's core 

These notions dead and meek 
Past the lower boulder choke 
Entombed by cunning weakness 
Accessed by morbid lore 

In the center of this remote cave 
I flow upon vermiculations 

In this remote cave 
In this remote cave 
In this remote cave 
In this remote caveWelcome to the burning of souls
Burn

Betrayed by heaven again
God above is just a fake
Nothing he promises he keeps
Lies and pain are what he gives

Is give me your soul
Your glorious soul
Your beautiful soul

But there is a price to pay
Welcome to the burning of souls
Dwell in my hell

I welcome you to the family below
Be yourself feast in sins feel free
Forget heaven forget the lies
Erase them all
Your soul is mine my world is yours
the pain is gone

You need a god
I am the one you want
I can kill your pain
All you have to do
Is give me your soul

Trust me I will take care of you

Welcome to the burning of souls

I will devour your soul

Welcome to the burning of souls
I am the soul burner
Welcome to the burning of souls
I can kill your pain
Welcome to the burning of souls
But there is a price to pay
Welcome to the burning of souls
Dwell in my hellUnholy
Is the lust in your eyes
"Blasphemous"
Would not suffice

Perverted
Are your wishes and dreams
Tanning in lucifers' beams

Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi

All your dreams will come true
All your dreams will come true

Oh satan
Devour us all
Hear our desperate call

Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi

Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferi
Per aspera ad inferiDestruction of inferior via dreams
Betrayal of the close ones, the ones of your kind
Background crumbling down before your own eyes
Perfect anger against the decaying surrounding world

Why to think of others? 
Why to think of myself?

Needs are becoming just useless lusts
Crushed by the awareness of other worlds and points of view

Why did they give you life? 
Why do they let you die? 
Why to think of others? 
Why to think of myself?

Worthless and rejected by own faith
Hatred stemming from the existence drawing near
An effort to change something about the impending end
So why not to give up and just be one of infinity

Why to think of others? 
Why to think of myself?
Why not to give up? 
And just be one of infinity?Sometimes my insane soul wants to dominate
Lay down I bite my veins mess is what create
Breathless now I know what I have to do
Murmur it means the end of you

Rotting away looks like a bloody mess I enjoy the day
i piss my tallow cause I fuck your ass-swollen
Is my cock dirty is my pride torture your corpse is open wide

Loose your blood smell your last fart you're sleepy subconscious relax
End of pain shell never be it a funny game come on lets play
Out of time I don't like it final perversion in ecstasy by speed

Here is no need to talk I get so confused
No one laughs when he dies
Can't tell you what's coming now
My distance I keep much too far

That's why the silent emptiness is covering me
Don't cry satisfaction is what used to be
Brain-dead this condition's near when I'm around
Repulsive a open head is just a woundHarlots, murderers, robbers
Choose the evil to be fellow
Your brains are empty and dull
I am governed by the subconcious
I believe in nothing
There is no turning back from hell
Darkness is a powerful Lord

My head knocks against tomb
I fear resurrection
I can see myself
on the bier.(Instrumental)Vader, Carcass

Wait till he hears about thisWhoredom of my town
Wherever I go - I smell stench
Stench of old dirty districts
Stench of scurvy human's matters
Violence flourishes everywhere
Creative thoughts die
Deep look of souls
Drowns of selfishness and sin
Instigators of conscience
For a pray of war
Shallow simple aims
Drunkness and corruption
Coarse aspirations
Devestation and primitive
This town rots
Decay in lifetime
Stinking and festering
Sinks in own litterThe fog is a sinister form of nature 
And it is creeping slowly above the ground 

But on the highway, it kills people 
A sacrifice for Mother Nature?one quiet moment in the burrow
the dismal thoughts are painting these silver halls
mourning stars have crystalized the evenings fire
they rise above the nightsky calling out for the tomorrow
shattered dreams turn into ever haunting echoes
fortify the one that is out there in the shadows

*

under skin pressure grows silently
fortify and then release
momentary heart bleed
fortify and then release

*

one drop for the crumbling darkened skies
one thought for the painted silver halls
one drop for the time all fell down
one thought for it all before the dawn
one drop to cover it all

*

one quiet moment in the burrow
silver halls are painted with taunting colors
mourning rays light the evenings fire even brighter
they fall down from skies when waiting the sunrise
shattered dreams turn into ever haunting calls
release the one thats gone beyond horizon

*

one drop for the crumbled skies
one thought for the painted silver halls
one drop to bury it all..

..fortify and then releaseDarkness embraces the earth
As the wolves howl to the moon
Announcing the coming of the end
Thousands of bodies with white blinded eyes
Walking to the black horizon
Armageddon is here, I am the one that will set you free
Now your soul belongs to me
And your body will rot in peace
Peace your soul, will never find
I am the black horder who commands a legion
From the 7th circles of hell
And i will make you burn in the lake of fire
Your dreams buried
Now what comes to life is
An eternal nightmare
I am the black horder
The one that will make you cry
I am the one that will make you burn
I am the one that will see you dead
I am the black horder
ARMAGEDDON IS HERE
I am the one that will set you free
Now your soul belongs to me
Now your body will rot in peace
Peace your soul will never find
I am the black horder
The one that will make you cry
The one that will make you burn
I am the one that will see you dead
I am the black horder
I am the black horder
I am the black horderSubmit a will ever designed to benign
Morphing hatred to purity well imagined

When destruction rolls devastation rumbles
Death ravages destiny revolts devastation rumbles
Death ravages

Never ending instance designed to streamline
Masking genuity to shame well embalmed

Doom doom disrupts danger fissures
Darkness engulfs demons dare dangure
Fissures darkness over-shadowing

Create a canvas in your mind untold unfold
Create a cocoon in your soul blindfold a mind
Create a cavern in your essence rewind
Remold concoct a cagein your psyche affixes

Power so strong bending space and time
Morphing reluctant well engrained
Doesn't even need a reason
Carelessly divides his former selfThis is my farewell
Damnation from a cavernous place
Excluded thoughts, dim macabre incantations
Misinterpretation

Goodbye
Goodbye to black empty skies
Goodbye to hollow words from forked tongues
Goodbye
Goodbye to eternal pain
Goodbye to deceit, to deceit and lies

So it's come to this
Pale empty stare
Abysmal horizon ahead
There is no turning back

Goodbye
Goodbye to black empty skies
Goodbye to hollow words from forked tongues
Goodbye
Goodbye to eternal pain
Goodbye to deceit, deceit and lies

Leaving traces of what could have been...(Psalm 91) 

Oh Eternal One, I bring my heart to you!
For You are worthy and holy!
Your hand shatters mountains and boils the sea...
By Your breath do the winds move...
And I bring my praise to You!

Your wrath lay secret above the universe...
Bring Your sword upon the sin that dwells within us...
For Your might is a blazing sun of strength...

You have restored this shattered soul...
But for Your grace I would be a corpse,
Rotting with the passing world...
You give life, O Sovereign One!
You give life!

O Father of Life, my heart beats for Your glory!
Death shall relinquish my body
But You, Lord, will gather up my spirit!

Let Your spirit fill my heart!
Your wonders abound in me...
I am nothing outside of You...
Eternal One, Almighty God, take this offering!

He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
Will rest in the shadow of the Almighty...
I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress,
My God in whom I trust."
You will only observe with your eyes
And see the punishment of the wicked...(Instrumental)Huh, unghh......

SHIT!ashes encase the holy planet
stench of burned flesh pregnants the air
praying voices halling
into the sacrileges night
announcing the diabolical inferno

father of fire
lord of the dead
incarnate evil
slay down the christian breed

dead bodies rising
burning stars falling from heaven
signs of the apocalypse
declaring the annihilation
when the mighty appalling appears

father of fire
lord of the dead
incarnate evil
slay down the christian breedA boy in a dress
Spent his childhood
Cause of his mother
Pretending to be a girl
Result of her sickly
Maternal desires
Broke up the family
Gained his sanity

Reset the relationship
Between the sexes
Saved by his father
Cared for by others
Left with the sick
To become healthy

Maybe the place
Maybe the people
He found the joy
To recreate the child
Grew up a man
Sensible and wise    
With an aim in life
Plan for the future

Yet no-one found
His dark secret
Which allowed him
To be happy
It let him leave

The walls of home
With fistfuls of joy
The jar overflowed

Remember why
Remember whom
Remember aim
Forget the curse

With his liberation
Came the hunter
His prey became
Those happy souls
Twisted methods
And devious ways
Of squeezing everything
To never stem the joy

Sinking ever deeper
Into the psychopath
Only fearing when 
The joy runs dry

His downfall
Caused by his greed
No-one for a moment
Ever doubted that

He was insane for
What he had done
It could only mean
Nothing to him

For he still used
The evil sorcery
So long as the jar
Of joy never ran dryHELLA

You'll, in my mind
You'll, never die

You enter in me
When I was alive
With your blue eyes
And a few of lies
Incredible feelings
In my mind
You never go out
Without I die

In good times or bad times
You were a friend of mine
I see in you lips
The way to eternal life
In good time or bad times
Ypu were a friend of mine
Pleased kiss me
And bring me to the other side

In can't believe
In can't believe
I've hatred
In can't believe
In can't believe
I've seen
In can't believe
In can't believe
I seeI crap on fucking holy books,
I desecrate the Quran pages,
I rape your popes, I molest nuns,
I used to do this shit for ages.

Soon will He return!
Godfuck, you shall burn!

Hear my cries from depths of Hell!
Hear the truth of Satan's spell!
Join me in unholy pleasure -
Join me in unholy pain!

Morbid black metal!

Burn the churches, crash the mosques
And explode the synagogues.
Fucking God is overthrown -
Fucking masters died in torture.

No gods - no masters!It's hard to believe that all this blood and piss was ejected from your body.
You have such a soft spoken scream.
I know I was in love when I swallowed your eyes.
I can hear bone shatter when you clench your teeth, and it leaves a beautiful thought in my mind.
Maybe you'd be fine if you were more passive.
I've been put on this earth to destroy the world's demons.
One less villain on the streets.
Rotting flesh has always been an elegant smell.
Contagion has really overthrown.
You fucking cunt.
Keep on believing and you'll only be shot down.Why don't we cry anymore
Why can't we admit that something's wrong
Why can't we just act normal
How much longer can this go on
Before we realize what we're doing
Before we realize this is wrong

So I sent my soul on a new road
Cut my feet upon the ground
Sold my soul
Faded out with fear
And I
I've got lots of friends in the next room
Who kept my feet above the ground

Why don't we cry anymore
Why can't we admit that something's wrong
Why can't we just act normal
How much longer can this go on
Before we realize what we're doing
Before we realize this is wrong

So I sent my soul on a new road
Cut my feet upon the ground
Sold my soul
Faded out with fear
And I
I've got lots of love in a red room
Kept my feet above the groundParasite
By Itay Necrofog Krasilshikov

Parasite
Growing, feeding on my flesh and skin.
Blinds my eyes
I swallow the poison deeply, inhale its death
The powerful stench, decay of a rotten pest
The evergreen pus drips down as tears,
Filling an ocean of terror and misery

My burning bones emit the flame into my soul
Liquefying eyes
Give this carcass rest, fury death
Let me see the night, free of life
Carry me down the path of blasphemous moon

Black fire
Terminal desire
Rippling waves 
Destruction slave
Optimal pain
Flying in flames
Feed that beast!
Let it feast!

Feed the monster forever,
Let it swarm the earth and fill the sky

Parasite!(Instrumental)Twin claw!
We're here to stay, we're here to follow our own way.
We've got the power to fight our struggle with honour....the power to fight our struggle with honour!

Feel no shame of who you are, of who you were, of what to be....the power to fight our struggle with honour.  (Repeat)When the breeze kills the noise
A new wish will be born

In a world I don't belong
Mess what I never lived
In a life I've never owned
Live what I'd never miss

And maybe I'm just a stranger
And maybe it won't fell bad
But the truth will stay forever
In this lost forbidden life

Like a bird in an glass cage
Gazing at the blurry outside
Like a slave without chains
Being held by my own doubt

Mellowing the steps in my road
Living under silence
Is the beauty of the stranger
What gives me strenght to go on

And maybe I'm just a stranger
And maybe it won't feel bad
But the truth will stay forever
In this lost forbidden life
And I know it could be better
And I know there's no way out
But tomorrow you'll be waiting
For this lost frobidden lifePrecursors of the menace
Admonition of the death
Obscurity and secret force
What are these symbols standing for?

Gomorrah, mother of harlotry
Gomorrah, ascendancy forever

An insidious looking creature
Beneath the frantic fault
Ready to be delivered
The son of our lord

Gomorrah, abomination of the earth
Gomorrah, wrath and fornication

He is crying with a resentful voice
Like a roaring lion
Sin city will burn he has no choice
They have to pay the price

Gomorrah, noisome grievous sore
Gomorrah, judgement of the whore

And their dead bodies
Shall lie in the streets
Where also our lord
Was crucified and killed

Gomorrah, downfall is near
Gomorrah, they didn't realise
Gomorrah, the have to disappear
Gomorrah, blessed are the dead(Instrumental)Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?ontspronghen uuten rooden gloet

The journey takes now many days and nights.
Near the mountains, which stand majestic before them,
they realise the wolvescry.
"Listen my son, the first trial is near." [Narog]

An old majestic oak protects them for the crawling dusk.
The cries come nearer and nearer.
Pulsating blood is what the wolves are scenting.
Raging desire drives them forward.

[Ref.1]
A black wolf jumps out of the thicket.
As fast as he can, Narog shots an arrow.

Which smashes the wolves heart.
Encouraged Tyrael takes a dagger.

Side by side they fight against the beasts.
Side by side a fight over life and death.

Screams run through the dark, cold night.
Blood splashed - swords splatter the bodies of the beasts.

[Ref.2]
The moon let their claws glitter like steel.
Their desire for fresh flesh was finished by a bloody fight.

Side by side they defeat the beasts.
Side by side they sow the ground with death.

"Once my son will become a great warrior."
"Protect me from the beast.
Give me power to defeat.
This night and all nights which will come.
Oh, my Master in Asgard, give me power for this run."(Lyrics adapted from the text by Robinson Jeffers)

Joy is a trick in the air, pleasure is merely contemptible,
But limitary pain- the rock under the tower
and the hewn coping
That takes thunder at the head of the turret-
Terrible and real. Therefore a mindless dervish
carving himself
With knives will seem to have conguered the world.

The world's God is treacherous and full of unreason,
A torturer.
Who fights him eats his own flesh and perishes
of hunger; who hides in the grave
To escape him is dead; who enter the Indian
Recession to escape him is dead; who falls in
love with the God is washed clean
Of death desired, and of death dreaded.

(However I suppose few in the world have
energy to hear effectively-
Have paid my birth-dues; am quits with the people.)He was a warrior...
Yes...(Instrumental)All around me becomes dark
And darkness covers my heart
Children love turns to lust
I turn from Angel into Satan

Goodbye my girl, I want to run and run from the soul
I want young girls from school and this is my mon amour

I made a deal with the devil (Jn. 8:44)
I bought a sweet life and sold the heavens (1 Jn. 2:15-17)
I paid 30 pieces of silver (Mat. 26:14-15)
I hang myself, the devil is waiting (Mat. 27:5)

Goodbye my girl, I want to run and run from the soul
I want young girls from school and this is my mon amour

"Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger
or discipline me in your wrath.
Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint;
heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.
My soul is in deep anguish.
How long, Lord, how long?
Turn, Lord, and deliver me;
save me because of your unfailing love" (Ps. 6:1-4)

Goodbye young girls, come back to school and do not fall
Hello my girl, forgive me and save my sinful soul

Goodbye the devil, I revoke our deal and i buy my soul
I want my Lord, I want to go to your holy worldDescends - unto the earth 
Exhumes - the fresh graves 
Corpses - are turned to slaves 
He drains your blood and embalms you alive 
Steals your soul as your body rots and dies 
Mortuary - his morbid home 
Cemetery - his creatures roam 
Enter - your life will end 
Creeping - spheres descend 
The spheres drill the blood and the brains from your head 
Your body twists and jerks until your finally dead 
Funeral's over the casket's closed 
Your body starts to decompose 
Remains are to be destroyed 
Brought into the crematory 
Enters - into your home 
He comes - to take your soul 
Mortician - you can't escape 
Dead - you're in the hearse(Instrumental)Crawling on hands and knees
Striving for recovery
A harsh unforgiving landscape
Unfathomable to the rural beings
As they sift through

Survival of the fittest
Ethereal struggle

Ice cold breeze stipulating the burning passion

Crawling on hands and knees
Striving for recovery
A harsh unforgiving landscape
Unfathomable to the rural beings
As they sift through

Survival of the fittest
Ethereal struggle

Ice cold breeze stipulating the burning passion

Crawling on hands and knees
Striving for recovery
A harsh unforgiving landscape
Unfathomable to the rural beings
As they sift throughInnocence or decadence,
what caused the stir?
was the sin of arrogance the rotten seed?

Wait, I'm waiting for the end
so stay, your souls will come with me
the brave now all feel so alone
will they be a pallid shade?

Man is a stage, unended metamorphosis

Now my pride strays me in the end
I sold myself to eternity
in a nest of misery
grew the false fruit of my death

But I was a grub and a grub I will be
my work when my body's found had trapped me in

Wait, I'm waiting for the end
so stay, your souls will come with me
the brave now all feel so alone
and the whole proves inane

No wings grow in the back of the deadI see towers of flame, and corpses too
I see the doom, of me and you
And I think to myself.... what a wonderful world.

I see skies obscured, I see no light
Dark freezing days, dark sleepless nights
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world.

The clouds of radiation are so pretty in the sky
Tumours on the faces of the people who survived
I see friends in the past kill each other for food
They're really starving......So will you.

I see babies die, I watch them decompose
They'll hurt much more, than I'll never know
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful worldAnother year, another lesson to learn
Another task, another failure
Beneath these physical progressions
We've made one giant step of degradation

Reaching the point of no return
As this world falls beyond control
Should we call this "development"?
Or should we agree "it's a self-destruction"?

Time will no heal the wounds and scars
Through the ages that we've passed
The love we have is the love we deny
Where greed seems for mor appealing

Millions have died as the victms of wars
And the millions live under extreme poverty
When we try to find something to blame,
our fingers are pointing of ourselves

It is so unpredictable... suddenly alll drown so deep
Our world is now crumble
Crumbled-down withing a thousand year
Lord please forgive us, we are weak
Live this life so far away from You Way
Here we must face the consequence
So many years we've refused to seek the Truth
Chosen to be under the influence...
...of ignorance

We've passed through the ages with greed
Creating all the profit-seeking systems
We built a tower withouth proper foundations
But now it's all too late as the tower falls...

This is what we are: helpless in our frustation
But yet I still hear the voice calling me back
I know I've wandered, so far away
From the pathway that is prepared for us

Everything changes
as we're approaching another millenium
But Your Love still remains the same
With the presence of You in our hearts
I believe, our love will surviveDIGNIFED STONES WERE OFFERING ME TRIBUTE WITH SILENCE

Isn't just the thing to calm me down
And I don't want to stay no more

I only want to drive to Frankfurt
Go up the gangway to the metal bird
Which takes me many miles from home

The strangest feeling that I've ever known
Rushing up and down my back
It is just a strange emotion
And the only healing potion
Is a journey to the stars

Stars and stripes - hello America
Glad to see you in seven weeks
I love you all here in America
In Anchorage or in Miami

Now it's time and the jet is pushing
As the thrust will move your back into the seat
While you will leave your home behind

Through the windows you see the clouds fly
And your fears and problems turned so empty now
The ocean is so great and wide

The strongest feeling that I've ever known
Rushing up and down my back
It is just a strange emotion

And the skyline appears in outlines now
In the distance you see the runway lights

As you walk downstairs the gangway
As your feet will touch united ground
You're finally be satisfied

The strongest feeling that I've ever known
Rushing up and down my back
It is just a strange emotion
And the only healing potion

We shared some knowing glances 
and some confirmed suspicions 
"I don't know" I lied, "I haven't seen that kid in ages" 
I was happy for you 
I was jealous even 
not of her but of the normalcy she represented 
But then you grew complacent 
She filled an empty space 
and filling holes was good enough to blind you to her toxic traits 

I struggle every day to see the things you see in her 
Two polar opposites with nothing better they can do 
than try to force themselves to tolerate each other's presence 
til no one else can even try at tolerating yours 

From the outside we could tell you that you got it wrong 
Show you how you changed and why you have to let her go 
We miss you - I miss you 
But how would you address the slow decay of 20 years' love?Night of horror, gifted with terror
Symphonies of the dead
Gripping inside the minds of sorcerers
None will save the fury of God

Wise men were warned and well prepared

Poor thee the ones with strong physicals
But weak in thoughts, earthly bliss!



Come to the hills
Their destinies were out of luck
Gather to the hills
Getting away from the living black

The sight of hell imaging the earth
Places of the sinisters giving birth
On this ground witnessing bloodbath
Slowly they were marching out to accept the wrath

Come to the hills
Their destinies were out of luck
Gather to the hills
Getting away from the living black

Depressions inside their minds
Confusions were parts of the binds
Shattered images enshrouded the blinds

Perishing the imbecile mankind

Below there the sea of blood menacing
Suffocated terminated parasites
Situations were highly bad provoking
Mass murder genocides

Come to the hills
Their destinies were out of luck
Gather to the hills
Getting away from the living blackBlackened skies
The stench of human rotten flesh
Pouring blood from chalice of stone
Nocturnal summoning

Raped full moon
Casting its tormented light
The endless feeling of something beyond
The darkness of the lord

Faceless shadow, fog of beyond
Starring into the coffin of the soul
Standing into the circle of blood
Burning in the ceremonial fire!

Unspeakable might
The will to cast the shadow
The crying rats chained and dead
Hanging down from rope

Pestilence of flesh
Cutting the cure deep within
To summon the beauty of death
To kneel before Him

Piercing through the wall
Driven so deep inside
Breathless calls cutting the soul
The utter darkness to see

The faceless shadow stabbing inside
Screaming inside the coffin of the soul
The satanik supremacy
Burning, calling in the ceremonial fire...Useless blood swayed by sunken moons
The misty sun is grown a dimmer gold
Where beauty with her doom conspires
To tell in flame what death and beauty mean
In a burnt land of ashes
Winter and silence and woe have come
Semen dried into the silence of rock and mineral
Silence all-attending and supremeA triage of thought
Stripped down to syllables
Each character, each letter
Every word

Cataracts, in a doll's eyes
Silhouettes, that destroy themselves

Equally stalemated
In the opposite direction
And to this tower of babble
I pay homage
To rape the senses

I fall short
Into emulsion scratched

Because both sides match(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Excised and anatomised, deviscerated disarray 
The torso diverged with pride 
Deftly amputated, evulsed limbs now defunct 
The trunk imbrued, tatty stumps used as lugs 
For a chondrin puzzle so quaint 
Head and body decollate 
A heaving mass so quiescent... 

Scattered and scrambled, your teasement grows 
- A bloody caricature to make whole 
A squirming grisly jigsaw, detrital fragments fit so snug 
- That missing piece will leave you stumped 
Totally desassembled, nicely sliced and diced 
- A cold mannequin once resembled 
Real cranium teaser, carved from flesh and bone 
- So mystifying... 

Battered and diffused, with placating blows 
- A human jigsaw to make whole 
A sequacious pattern which once fitted so snug 
- Joining together each dubious lump 
Ravaged disassembly, neatly cubed and diced 
- A cold mannequin reassembled 
Astute brain teaser, incorporate flesh and bone 
So mortifying... 

An incessant game - methodically made 
With each cumulative piecing - of commensated meat... 

Bi-manual reconstruction, eldritch problem complete 
A convented effigy 
A pathological toy, each chunk rigorously 
Inter mortis locking, as you pathogenically rot 
Such a perplexing task 
To fit the remains in the casket 
Uliginous mess so quiescent...

A cross is burning in a field tonight
Hatred spills from the men in white
They're too far gone for us to save
Hatred fills a clear blue sky

We watch the anger and wonder why
We watch the anger and wonder

To stop the truth and hide the shame
In the heart of Dixie
We were taught to hide the shame
In the heart of Dixie

Stop the truth

I'll be too blind to move and see
My memories are pretty gone
And by nature I'm all alone

Still I miss your voice so clear
I miss your empathy for real
I wonder if you sit or stand
I wonder why the good things end

Now I would even try again...

We only went out that night
We only went out that night

And I walk down down a crowded street
I wonder if we just could meet
I try to see your face around
But no blue eyes I have found

Still I miss your point of view
Your words to me were always new
I was too lucky to be with you
The fate just killed me, yes it's true

Oh baby, you don't know how much I miss you..

We only went out that night
We only went out that night
And I remember your last goodbye
We only went out that night

After that night I kissed you twice
While you were sleeping I was crying
Cuz we would of never meet againBloody full moon

The night has begun
with blood on my hands
a freezing night
the way to the cemetery

The cold winter
covers my erect member
until the end of time
the coldness of my spirit ...

Hate in my spirit
The misanthropy of my soul
The light of the full moon
enlightening the corpses

Hope is an illusion
Blood is true
The full moon is magical darkness!
Death is the truth

Enter the plains of your thoughts. 
This is where I command, where you obey
I had always been here 
Although you never noticed. 
You are a simple vessel, like many others 
A simple citizen, like so many others
Seems to be useless, to be myself (to feel myself)drowned in a sea of ego, sailed by my own madness
Try to taste reality, i just tried that
All i get is this nil effect, falling down in this place again
Images fading away 
You no longer choose your destiny
The wheel of fate stopped 
Your life awaits
My quest is complete, but not overInactive mind, 
I am done with you
Can't you see it? You're dying with me
They're leaving you all alone
inner: Let me lead your steps
self: your steps are drowning me
inner: I know where you must go
self: go away you bastard
inner: Let me take control
self: must control my 
innerselfinnerself: you can't stop it now
the wheel is turning...Your silence tells me everything though
Your eyes give me nothing
Hurry up and die like a good solider wouldEntering the final chapter
The chapter feared by billions
Where the splurge of wealth
Is hiding a part of the world in poor health
We have an eager childhood but a delinquent youth
And soon we'll even have to pay the fucking air we
Breathe

All we feared has come true
All we had has gone
All the prayers we said
To get through
Died in the void of doubt
The truth is untold: we're off the line, off the world
Just the poor working class feeding the eminent whores
A line for the mental,
A bottle for the soul
Unthinking generations
Breeding more and more

We are the ones who loseMy soul travels in the wind of hell
Controlled only by its ghastly breath
Each move, each thought
Belongs to a corrupted pattern
A spiral reaching towards my death

The taste of the tumour-filled cunt of suffering
Tempts me like if I was dead
Endlessly searching for proof that I was living
Letting those metaphors piercing through my head

My eyes are horns
From despair they grow and blinds my sight
My eyes are thorns
Crowning the fallen messiah of light

And they are inverted crystallized damnation
Under the face of God they are dreaming, laid to waste
But at night they are the owl
Demonwings in endless search for prey

And as I hunt for that whore of self-destruction
The wind of hell carries my soul
For my eyes are horns, the unholy spirals
And under that genius madness I am controlled

Demonseed it lives through me
A screaming, violent, bloodstained need
Fulfilled though venom and though steel
How can an illusion be more than real?!My thoughts are overflowing of greatness 
my world is full of destructive demons 
my heart is a stone of calamities 
my life is a hymn of terror 

I land in an apocalyptic world 
I persecutes the psychotics 
I control scientists and septics 
who hiding my presence to the mass 

I am Satan, the fallen angel who tortures sinners 
I am your woe, your tears and your ardor 
I am Satan, the fallen angel who dreams 
to the glory of evil in a heritage empire 

Satan, Satan

Satan, Satan 
the master of vice 
Satan, Satan

the genius of whim 

I grow hell 
with the flesh of sinners 
and I aspire their wretched souls 
they nourish my bestiality 

I will make these morbid works 
until the world capsize 
and my huge empire 
moved there with evil 

I am Satan, the fallen angel who tortures sinners 
I am your woe, your tears and your ardor 
I am Satan, the fallen angel who dreams 
to the glory of evil in a heritage empire

A king will come, strong & bold
Strong & bold

Sworn to protect and a land to defend
Strength in his might and light without end

Darkness will fall and his right will prevail
He who was chosen will rise without fail

Taming the storm and keeping the faith
Born to rule and sworn to his fate!
He's sworn to his fate!

No charm can protect the keepers of sin
Enraged with his fury no mortal can win
Brimming with justice and ready to judge
All doubts cast aside the time is at hand

Hail to the king, salvation of souls
Driven by honor his name to uphold
Doubted by none his task is at hand
Destroying all discord across all the land

Casting out evil of darkest domains
Slaying the dragon with case and disdain
A man of his honor which none can oppose
Riding to battle, to right all the wrongs

To right all the wrongs!
And willing to fight!
To right all the wrongs!
Believing what's right!

Written in the books of yore are told...
A king will come to save us all...As truth's war still plummets
I'm sick to my stomach for my rose I would leave
My barren lonely star
Sketch me a picture
Use only your mind
My imagination will make it turn out just right

[Chorus:]
I would give everything
Gathered from worlds afar
Sift through realities
Figure it out
One world to another
Search the heart of man
To die in the dreamland and never walk free again

[Chorus]

The fact that you are alone
So full of infertile grounds weak and oblivious
Speaking without a sound
The boy's soul plummets
I'm sick to my stomach
For my rose I would heal any scare
Unlike me her wound stay open and bleed
Left no choice head to the woods and fleeI RECALL,THE SMOKELESS FIRE WHERE THE STARS ARE BORN

I HAVE SEEN THE WAR IN HEAVEN,NO FUCKING HEROES

Like a metronome 
Debriefed at length 
By a steady diet of amphetamines

Downward well 
Of social compression 
Self contained lie 
Of upward social mobility 

Persecuted labor surrogate 
Sprinkle me with lime 
A mundane euthanasiaLying staring at the ceiling I'm hardly awake 
Try to clear my mind but night brings those things I can't shake 
Crystal like waters swirl round in the blackest of lakes 
Peering deep into what is inevitable fate 

Sight is now blinded by darkness and it feels serene 
Into a greater reality much to be seen 
Some think these visions to be nothing more than a dream 
Take a step into my world to see just what I mean(Instrumental)i confess my sins to spruces 
this ravine is my church 
a cold colder than this cold 
world warms my bleeding heart

i was born when wolves chanted their hymns 
i mourned with fall and rejoiced with spring 
now in this cavity 
i cloak myself with with nature's eternity 

i break the seal of bark the forest spread wisde 
fast faster than my ardent soul is the pace of death 
sympathy of the wolves

washes away every right and wrong

i mourned with fall and rejoiced with spring
now in this cavity 
i cloak myself with nature's eternity 

one with this soil 
worms inside of me 
thousand pieces of my mind 
now shattered among sand starsYou will find me standing in the shadows
Dressed to the nines
With the image of your murder
Burning in my eyes
I'm the handsome stranger
Who took you for a ride
I offered you some candy
On the day you died

I'm Jack! and you're my victim
I was born to take your life
You were born to suffer
At the hands of Jack the Knife

I'm on your favorite TV show
I'm everywhere you look
I'm a star of stage and screen
and the latest murder books
I'm the Devil's paintbrush
and he likes the colour red
You're my latest masterpiece
Dismembered on your bed

I'm the beast in black, i'm Saucy Jack
from Never-Never Land
I'm the heavy metal boogie man
Catch me if you can!
Ripper, slasher, nightstalker
Each of them a tasty slice
but future generations will call me
Jack the Knife!

Inverted pentagrams
In lipstick on your wall
The symbol of my saviour
I carved into my palm
I use a knife to make my mark
Name and number of the beast
In the flesh of some young lovely
Recently deceased!

I'm the perfect gentleman
Who's trust you all betrayed
Satan's little helper
With a razor blade

A pint of demon rum
and some little yellow pills
...help make my thinking clearer
...help me decide if I should kill

I'll show you a thing or two
With surgical precision
And as the blood begins to flow
I'll know I made the right decision
The final incisionHang ten!

Hang ten!In my city
Under my sky

Emptiness

In Amsterdam
In Waikiki's beach

Emptiness

I take drugs
I bang everyone

Emptiness

I see you
I feel you

After the big wave my live is perfect
before the big wave everything was going to the Void

[stoner reprise]

remeber me
when waves brake the rocks
the silece is not voidIn Arpil I waited for the Easter Bunny 
And when He came it sure felt funny 
In July I stayed up waiting for George Washington 
Who spilt his seed prematurely on my thumb 
And in October the Jack-o-Lantern came by 
And made my bedroom smell like pumpkin pie 
November was exciting but all my friends were shocked 
When I slept with all the Pilgrims of Plymouth Rock 
And in December, Santa put me to the test 
But I did what he said and I quickly got undressed 
Now it's January and I'm pressed up to the window pane 
Wishing and hoping but is it all in vain? 
It's January, Jesus, January's here 
When will you show up and pop me in the rear? 
Jesus, having sex with you is never scary 
But please don't make me do it with Joseph and Mary!All is placid now,
For the drowsy dawn
Has risen
From the phantasmal ashes
Of twilight's untamed musings,
And blazes in ethereal colors,
Just before me.

I might reach out
And touch it,
Were I ignorant
Of its inevitable approach. I am resurrected
From my infertile slumber
And my vague, fantastic dreaming.
To bear again,
The truth,
My volatile humors,
And the heavy wait
Of my salvation.
I am Sisyphus;
I command the hand of god.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Landscape behind the eyelids 
Behind the eyes of ophidian eyes 
Lay down the corpse of the planet joy 
In a joyless movement of absent 
Caged into the mirror wander a cold essence 
Arcane harbinger of chaos and eater of dreams 

Before your eyes a face of mirror 
Of a freezing spiritual cenotaph 
And thou shalt see what the fuck you might see 
Behind the shine of every star and in every winds manifestation 
In every key they would hold looking for the right door 
Behind their eyes an old void filled with imaginary 
The illusory map of a sea of nothingness 
They have been traveling together but yet all alone(Instrumental)Spare me your lame excuses
You think i find it funny?
Take another good look
How many times can aperson screw things up?
Perhaps you're aiming for that Guinness book?

I'm done covering, it's just embarrasing
To stick your head into the sand
Won't make it go away
I know you're not dumb
Yet something clearly is missing
What did the T-shirt say?
Same shit,different day...

Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up

I don't want to turn my back on you
I'll be the last person to abandon the ship
But there's a limit to how far
One can carry another
When all you do is slip and slip and slip

No more bull, think a little ahead
Fed up listening to your sorry ass voice
Never thought i'd call you a fool
But these nasty habits of yuo leave no choice

Clean it up
Clean it up


Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up"This is a song about eatin' food! Bum, bu-du-dum, dum..."

Eat my poop! 
Drink my pee!
Eat my fucking shit!I am fish
I eat money
Financial truth
It's my lake

The drink of liquid gold
It's my secret
Nothing is everything
Nothing is everything

I am fish
I eat money
Financial truth
It's my lake(Instrumental)Stand and fight, embrace this moment 
Stand and fight, hold your ground 
Stand and fight, channel your anger 
Stand and fight, toward the common cause 

There is no one left to blame 
Only ourselves for letting it get away 
But we can all rise above 
If we work together and fight as one 

Stand and fight, embrace this moment 
Stand and fight, hold your ground 
Stand and fight, channel your anger 
Stand and fight, toward the common cause 

Our time has finally come 
For us to unite and fight as one 
We can stand aside 
As we watch our freedoms die 

Stand and fight, embrace this moment 
Stand and fight, hold your ground 
Stand and fight, channel your anger 
Stand and fight, toward the common causeAncient scripture upon the wall
Carvings tell a prophecy
A Godly statue awaits release
To reign this land once more
Knowledge of writings slips away
Time grows ever short
Worshipped only by a few 
Await the chosen one

An elder race, pray to he
keeping his name alive
As the years pass by your kind
numbers dwindle, tales die
Strictly following the sacred rites
Generations pass him by
His name lives for centuries
Until his time doth come

Statue waits in marble halls
A motionless god awake no more
Contained within his stone-clad fort
Imprisoned by a curse
Echoing walls , a sacred shrine
Display a god in static state
Something lives deep within
A Lord, A God, Your future King

A child born with holy mark
coming forth , the chosen one.
Set the quest centuries convey
writings, truth unfolds.
Across the deserts of distant lands
A man's crusade must go
Return your Saviour, son to thee
Release the Emperor, promised to me

In the halls, a statue stands
A lord awaits his promised land
Fulfil the prophecy of the ancient ones
Release the God, let him rule once more
Land barren and so forlorn
Needs a lord to rule once more
Let him free and be the one
To command his chosen sonFor king and country I will hunt you down
They tough me how I'd never be found
Work for a three letter agency
No pension plan is waiting for me, no!

I use the night as my cover
I'm sneaking up on you
I am the hunter and you are the prey
I got a mission you're fading away

They recruited and programmed me
Took away my identity
It was all a conspiracy
They took my life I'll never be free, no!

If you see me coming
Well you know it's too late
They trained med well I'm blind but I see
What this life has done for me

They recruited and programmed me
Took away my identity
It was all a conspiracy
They took my life I'll never be free, no!

They recruited and programmed me
Took away my identity
It was all a conspiracy
They took my life I'll never be free, no!Got a rolling feeling in my head 
Never sleeps, Never Falters 
Question all that is and ever was 
Til I find the final answer 
Seeking out release 
Push and pull and scream 

Vision of the path that I gotta go 
Nothing here could ever stop me 
All in my way I shall bid farewell 
Moving like a thousand winds I go 
Tearing down the walls, Tear this place apart 

From sealed fate to Vicinity of Infinite possibility 
Monumental escape, no longer bound by the ways i'm one with universal sway 

Running back and forth between the lines 
Now I see there is no boundaries 
Rushing through my body through my brain 
All I know now driving me insane 
Crawling through my skin, Changing what has beenI hear my soul
I hear her tears
I drowned out her pain
It's my hell, my hell

I want to be a thief
I want to curse you
I want to hate you
hate you, hate you

Look down and to down and to do...
Look down, I want to lie with you
Pray stronger and stronger for us
Give me your hand and trust

We look at the stars, they are far away from us, we can not reach them by hand,
but your hand is in my hand
We can not fly into the Milky Way or Black Eye, but we can fly to our hearts,
cause my heart is in your heart

"God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them" (1 Jn. 4:16) Amen
"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Mat. 6:21)
"God is light; in him there is no darkness at all" (1 Jn. 1:5)

"I have seen all the things
that are done under the sun;
all of them are meaningless,
a chasing after the wind" (Ec. 1:14)

I hear, and your soul
I torment my flesh.
I do not want to go
to hell, to hell

I want to be a saint
I want to bless you
I want to love you
Love you, love you


Look down and to down and to do...
Look down, I want to lie with you
Pray stronger and stronger for us
Give me your hand and trust

We look at the stars, they are far away from us, we can not reach them by hand,
but your hand is in my hand
We can not fly into the Milky Way or Black Eye, but we can fly to our hearts,

"God is light; in him there is no darkness at all" (1 Jn. 1:5)Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me?
Occupy my brain?
woah yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too lateyou walk thru my door i can't believe that you
that you stand in my way again
i told you once before that i don't want your love
to hold me back and then

you fall to your knees begging me please
to take you back into my heart
i will not stand for i won't hear more
lovely lies fall from your mouth

it won't be that easy to forgive your sins
i hate you despise you just leave me alone

you fall to your knees begging me please
to take you back into my heart
i don't want your face to enter my space
cause i don't love you any more

i won't be the one to save you from yourself
you are no more to me go back to your own hell

i cannot wait to free myself
you have been drowning me
in a black ocean
dragging me down

i used to dream before we met
now when I close my eyes
i just see your face
staring into my soulSevered ties
Whitened eyes
Cradled head

Soldered wives

I see you disappearing.

Invent your last smile,

Deep knowledge in which the ancient
Bestiary of the mind burns to ashes.Open the cunt of desecrated life
Feel its horror within
A chalice filled with blood from the mother of Christ
Drink and feel the foul taste of sin
For the purest white has turned into pitch black night
By a servant's offering!

The coldness of a razor and 
The warmth of the flame of hell
Circle of purest dark
Has opened a gate to a rotten virgin's grave
Compelled by the Devil's mark

Behold the living corpse defiled
Lies breathing in the altar of death
Screaming in pain
As the blade undress
Her body from its flesh
For this blissful sight
Of darkest might
And the sound of her last breath

A vision of darkness for Satan's glory
And in emptiness praying
For her divine pain
A sign carved into my skin
Has opened a tomb of unspeakable shame

The coldness of a razor and
The warmth of the flame of hell
A circle of purest dark
Has opened a gate
To a rotten holy virgin's grave
Enslaved to the Devil's mark(Instrumental)(Instrumental)She never talks about herself to others
But stands apart in silence
When we all talk

Her eyes keep looking down, pale and empty
But once they could rise up
To look a man's face

...Wishing to smile again...

'Trust' is the word she cannot hear anymore
She'd open wide her eyes
But still she feels she can't

She can't remember
How to trust a man

Everyday screaming against her mirror
Sick'n tired of the games that people play
Fragile like a glass, hiding burning scars

She lives inside herself
She can just stand apart
Longing for a sincere smile
Locked heart inside

She lives inside herself
Pretending she's alright
Longing for a sincere smile
Locked heart inside

Now she's found the real love she dreamt
A man who's able to let her glitter again
- But still she feels her chains -

On and on she tried to show her soul to him
But finds her love
Trapped by doubts and fears...

Cryin' out, cryin' out
'Set me free!' She cries out loud

[solo Fede]

Cryin' out, screaming loud
She cannot free her love again
As in sorrow calls his name

She's trapped inside herself
She can just kiss her scars
Still cryin' for deliverance
Locked heart inside

She lives inside herself
For they shut down her light
Longing for a sincere smile
Locked heart inside

Hopeless dreams and burning tears
Locked heart inside

one day she'll shine again...Against All Enemies 

Mutiny of lie, damned from hate,
Of brutal torture, deadly fate.
Feeling of madness, death redemption,
Threat from the lie, deadly temptation.
You must DIE or parish you hate,
But first I try to change your fate.
All their might is only deception,
Who unite HELL of Inquisition.

Against All Enemy ... The bloody execution
Against All Enemy ... Unhuman persecution. 

Against damned, mutiny and fight,

In self-smaller insanity, atrocity might.
Deadly blessing of bloody violence
You burn down in HELL torture from sentence.
You stand solitary and abandoned,
Outside the cemetery you are DOOMED.
Christians faces testify against you,
It's time to DIE and to cease lie. 

Against All Enemy ... The bloody execution
Against All Enemy ... Unhuman persecution.

Dead immortality of cruel violence,
Die martyr from repulsive sentence.
Brutal murdered in treachery and revenge,
Lunatic kill, on the rack oblige. 

At the gates cemetery , death delight Legends tell of a place abandoned 
A distant island shunned by my race 
There a once great city lies 
Haunted by dreams from time yet to pass 
There something fell to Earth 
A sphere which came from beyond our skies 
From it the traveller emerged 
The knowledge she shared was to be her doom 

Her statue stands alone as stone 
Expectantly pointing into the sky 
Since my specious ancestors 
Dared to turn her gifts back on her 
But the legends also say 
She foretold she would return to life 
When the planets and stars aligned 
And her last words were spoken 

I know the words, the curse 
Discovered on aeon old tablets 
Beneath the temple 
Transcribed to devices 
Lost to history 
When the ancients fell 

Where did they flee my forebears? 
What did her curse do to those who remained - they are gone 
Now I speak the words and free her 
Will she give me her grace? 

I speak the words 

She wakes 
Speak to me 
Speak unto me 
I have come here for I must know Ignoratio Elenchi [Reversed Genesis]

Birth and death are the same; they are the two sides of one door. To enter one room always means leaving another. It depends on which room or which life we are in as to whether we say "entrance" or "exit," life or death. For he who understands it, death holds no terrors. But he who did not go his proper way in life and sinned will see his guilt in death. But there is after death no place of torture, no hell. To see one's guilt is the severest judgment and at the same time the greatest penalty. Judgment and punishment are within yourself. Neglected work can only be made up by double effort. It will once more be your choice, either to work toward the world plan, or to be its enemy. That is the only death that there is, to become a force for destruction rather than for creation, and this death is not physical. It is your free choice to decide on which side you belong, on god's or, to use an old term, "the devil's." What we call birth and death is only the door between two worlds. There is no birth and no death, only change, and we can go confidently through the door, for all the worlds were created by one hand.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Nerveless body torn

Farming out the earth's marrow
A litmus tested metaphor
Proven for conscienceless rape

Serial catastrophe
Cumulatively irreparable damage
Destruction has set
A limitless bound

Trinityindustrial darkness

factories works in darkness
loading  their chemical charges
deep in the bunkers..
preparing for war and destruction

spreading darkness!
rising  chemical ashes!
Death and pollution!
this is the modern plague!

the human race is a disease
kill the soul and spirit,
war and darkness
In the industrial darkness.

Extinction is the only way!
Extinction is the only solution!
Extinction is the only end!
Extinction is our name!

(All music, lirycs by Neurotic /
 Lirycs, Vocals by Atropodos Mortha)Giving rise to self delusion 
A blueprint for volition deferred 
Punctuated sense left defused...raped 

Casual abuse remains unchallenged 
In any form but words 
Words that expressions of token gesture. 

Ritual blanket of grey, spouting a fixed lie.TRIUMPH

Annihilate
The enemy
Gods of blood
Follow me

Black banner marble arch
A massive army up to march
Skulls to crush land to raid
Brothers attack victors invade

Soldiers of the nation
Answer Triumph's call
Without you we're nothing
With Triumph we're all

Might is right behead the snake
Evil beast a back to break
Gods of blood bless our war
We shall rule forever more

War awaits of soul and gun
Men march on towards the sun
Dawn of anger day of strife
Men march on go prove your life

Fight to conquer death without shame
Tribe of fire defend the flame
Hail the eagle lord of the sky
By Triumph win by Triumph dieAll effort in vain 
My face is cold it marks the anger to have to feel this way, 
My words exposed sold all that you believe in all that you condemn, 
ALL EFFORD IN VAIN! Pledgefully you vowed to dedicate your life, 
but with a golden crown of thorns you preach the life of Christ! 
Feed off all your condemn. (selfishness and greed, vanity) 
Expression lies in yourself. (not to be held down by profanity) 
Breath in the opposition, they feed on promises you supply. 
Fill your pockets with riches, provided by those you leave in fright. 
Feed off all you condemn. (selfishness and greed, vanity) 
Expression lies in yourself. (not to be held down by profanity) 
No, punishment for those who lie, 
he who lies will be denied, 
With a golden crown of thorns you preach the life of Christ. 
We're the ones who will laugh last, 
when we see you fall 
when you take off your mask 
And show your true identity to us... 
All efford in vain 
Feed off all you condemn. (selfishness and greed, vanity) 
Expression lies in yourself. (not to be held down by profanity) 
Not to be held down by profanity 
not to be concerned of your vanity, 
Not to be held down!Pull to the centre
Push it away
Let go and grasp
Magnetic stream
Around you now

Aeons fly before
Ages pass away
All seen by the stones
And the eye
Fixed high above
...High above

Gold ring spin around
We all shine silver now

Experience to let you grow
Reach out for your own unknown
Pull towards the opposite pole
Lose your senses and go with the flow

Grow through the spring and the summer
Slow through the darkness
Shake off Winter and move with the seasons

Earth turns silent overhead
From the centre of Ukhurt
In the tetrahedron
Scar of those who came before

Evil came before
Sulphur lakes licked at the shore
I've been here before
At the hyper-dimension

Unearther of truths
I am the real chosen one
No false banners here
Ne'er righteous or holy could call me sinner
SINNER!

Witness to that creation
Condensed dark and light
And curse your ignorance

For we exist right now
And continue traditions of dead generations
We continue traditions of dead generations(Verse) 

These coffins surround me 
While the earth stands still. 
The moon is shining in my eyes. 
This darkness confounds me 
Hear the screams, so shrill 
From the Tower of judgement, the taker of life 

(Verse) 

I am the chosen one 
And I will take this army through the maze of life 
command these gods inside my mind. 
These dreams, the spirits speak 
With this gun to my head, I'll face my death tonight 
Unleash the power within 
As we fight through the labyrinth that disappears in the light 

(Pre chorus) 

Under the midnight sun 
We'll take this tower down 
We'll take it to the ground 
To fight another day 
In this dark hour 
We'll break this tower down 
We'll save you from the fall 
And noone will know our names. 

(Verse) 
This fire inside me. 
Slowly eats my soul 
This power grows with every breath 
These shadows won't blind me 
I will burn them all 
For failure is a fate worse than death 

(Pre chorus) 
Under the midnight sun 
We'll take this tower down 
We'll take it to the ground 
To fight another day 
In this dark hour 
We'll break this tower down 
We'll save you from the fall 
And noone will know our names. 

(Chorus) 
Shadows dancing on the walls 
The harbinger of death, destroyer of humanity 
Praying for the final fall 
The season of rebirth is here to take it all away. 

(Bridge) 
And so the stage is set. She's come to bring the winter of rebirth. 
These shadows reign on my judgement day. 
And only I stand between this beast and a burning earth. 
I will face my destiny, and fade away. 

Shadows in the light, they fall. 
The Tower crumbles down around and crashes into the void. 
Here it is, my final call 
The devil turns to ash as I rise into the sky. 

(End)so the days they come and they go
waiting for a moment out of your life

as the day turned into a bow
can't you see time has taken your gold

day follows the day
time without time-waste away
haze-wasted away
follow the trace - I am lazing away

so your chance go round in a wire
there have been a thousand times of goodbye

as the day starts the same as before
so much lazy days I've been wasting away

day follows the day
time without time-wasted away
haze-day after day
going ahead - I am fading away

so you break the fence of the days
looking for a million places to go

every smile will hurt in your face
every little move is like the same as beforeSee the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
But I wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of faith
On a bed of nails she looks like weight
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you do it so gay

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without youCan't stop thinking, Where I am
Can't stop running, From where I stand...now

Body Dome Light (X2)

Can't stop shining, But Noone sees
Won't stop living, But Noone feels...now

Body Dome Light (X2)There was a sudden power output surge
A deadly technique intones the dirge
Blast, shockwave and radiation
A new kind of abomination

The air itself is sucked up
And seems to catch fire
The structures crumble like dust
Contamination reigns
Radiation breath

Some energy creates
An electromagnetic pulse
To destroy the electrical... circuits

The air itself is sucked up
And seems to catch fire
The structures crumble like dust
Contamination reigns
Radiation breath

The potential to destroy the entire world
There is so much heat and extreme light

The intention to destroy the entire world
It scorches everything... an extreme might

In the days, weeks and month to follow
The sun hides behind the clouds
The nuclear winter covers
The earth with a shroud

The air itself is sucked up
And seems to catch fire
The structures crumble like dust
Contamination reigns
Radiation breathSpiritual Weaponry

This light that I see deep inside,
songs from Walhalla they come
Spiritual weaponry
I'm tired, the end is close,
one more night and my live is done
Spiritual weaponry
The sun creeps under the shadows in grey,
coldness is my torment
This is the beginning of an eternal trip
this is the way to my last battle
My life fly's away
for death embraces my last wish;
the desire to get more
I'm weak but I'm a warrior
I'm gonna fight for my honour and land
The last blood in my vains
flows for you Wotan
I swear yes
I swear yes
I swear for you Wotan(Instrumental)Shit! I'm low an battery
iPad parent, shame on me
Pierce my eye and dream about
A testicle tattoo

Need more gadgets to decorate
Frame my shallow, sorry state
I so want my asshole to be
Pretty just for you

I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
Saving up for an anal bleach

Happiness is a friend request
Jerk off to a binary breast
Oops, my youngest may have drowned
While I deleted spam

Tweet, tweet all day long
Desperate to belong
I am not sure I even do exist
If it ain't on Instagram

I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
Saving up for an anal bleach

Into a reservoir of nothingness
Browse until we drop

Twinkle, twinkle little star
Can you see how fucked up we are?
Everything is not enough
And we never, ever stopI'm a speed demon with white line fever
A hundred forty-four miles an hour
I'm hot wired, I got wheels of fire and
No one's gonna stop me now

Can you hear it now? Can you see it now?
It's right before your eyes
Can't you taste it now? It's in your face now
And it smells like paradise

I'm a speed demon and my mind is screamin'
As I kick it into overdrive
I'm a speed demon and right now i'm feelin'
Like I won't come back alive

I can finally see shades of victory
This race has reached its end
Back on the bullet train - hellfire is in my veins
I start all over again

Can you hear it now? Can you see it now?
It's right before your eyes
Can't you taste it now? It's in your face now
And you know you're gonna die

I'm a speed demon and my mind is screamin'
As I kick it into overdrive
I'm a speed demon and right now i'm feelin'
Like I won't come back alive

Black magic! White powder!
Turn the music up a little bit louder!
Rocket fuel! Brute speed!
A little bit of devil dust is what I need!

I'm a speed demon and my brain's on fire
I'm ready like Freddy, i'm completely wired
I'm a speed demon and I know i'm not dreamin
Got a monkey in my trunk and it's time to feed 'im
I'm a speed demon and i'm comin' down fast
I'm low on fuel... I gotta make it last

I'm a speed demon and my mind is screamin'
As I kick it into overdrive
I'm a speed demon and right now i'm feelin'
Like I won't come back aliveAs the hours decay the light
Rays of sun consumed by night
Only the stars look down on us
As a bird out from your mouth
Spirit freed whirls unbound
By the shackles of your flesh and blood

Cloaked in the shadow of secrecy
Meeting of souls that none shall see
They let the break of day decide
The fragile fabric of your life
Is torn apart by the dawning light
Your voice fell silent forevermoreTIGHTEN FIRST RAISE SWORD
IT'S HIGHEST TIME TO RESTRAIN SAVAGERY
VIOLENCE CHALLENGED TO WORLD
NOBODY ELSE WON'T TAKE THIS FIGHT

NECROLOGY CAPTURED ANOTHER WALL
CEMETARY GOT ANOTHER CROSSES
DEATH LOST DIMENSION OF NECESSITY
JUSTICE'S BELL WILL TOLL THIS TIME
TIME ALLOWED SUBMISSION OF BLOOM
ANGEL USED CLOSED EYE


MORAL IDEA WON'T RESTORE THE ORDER
REALITY DISPERSED POWER OF LAW
THIS IS LAST STRAW OF RAPE AND EVIL
OF SCARY AGGRESSION WITH LOUSY FOUNDATION
BECAUSE LIFE ARISED SO THAT MIGHT LIVE
AND TAKE OVER LAW OF FREEDOMNo life expectations
all I had was gone over time
all the circles have been destroyed
Now...
again find myself lonely, forgotten by all that around me
only losers still by my side
as me losers...

what was lost, was the result of my actions
now bitterly reflect my past actions
still can not turn back...
everything will be in the past

the little that had been lost
Now the will to self-destruct is increasing
increasingly being consumed by my many negative feelings
my wrists open again now...
but still not the time of final action

an immense emotional pain arises from the depths of my soul
destroying it bit by bit
corrupting my mind, my thoughts...
returning them to the past,
blaming me for the events...
I let it happen again, once again I was weak and unable to avoid...
almost all the lights went out for my life

increasingly become minimum my reasons to continue with life
maybe just the fear of making another mistake...
delete the last light...
the last light...Face a shadow
Slices the night
When the legend's begun
Feel the power
Feel the fright
When the damage is done

She said, hey, to me
Babe take me for some action
You are like me
We both can reach our dream

Hot and pretty

And her body
Burns like hell
Like flashing rays of the sun
And her eyes
A magic spell
Enchanted me again

She said, hey, to me
Babe take me for some action
You are like me
We both can reach our dreamDays undercover it's time to return
I'm in over my head there is too much to burn
Enemies they where but now they are my friends
It's time to jump out now that I know who I am

On my way out from my plave in paradise
On my way out to the brink of insanity

Days undercover days to discover
My intentions are good as my faith grows weak
Last time I looked I was an agent of Ghost
Today I don't know I am the leak

I ain't nobodys saviour an agent who lost his faith in the cause
I ain't nobodys saviour an agent who found his cause by force

Return of the hero should be in it's place
A sign of goof faith ain't enough in this race
Remarks of the past was repeatedly mentioned
I return to you now I am an agent of Ghost

I ain't nobodys saviour an agent who lost his faith in the cause
I ain't nobodys saviour an agent who found his cause by forceMet een rattentand
maakte ik ruimte voor u
rits voor rits verloor ik
mijn rechterhand

Nagels krabten bloedend
een symbool van kracht door pijn
Daar rees Hij omhoog
met mijn linkerhand zich voedend

Ik beet het hout, dat
gestaag was geblakerd
(en) kleurde de krachtige Ziener
tot ik geen kaak meer had

Doffe slagen van mijn hoofd
vormden zijn heilig huis
Weet gij hoe men zal branden?
Het vuur mag nooit gedoofd

Vol lof was den Vereerden
in der tijden begin
Daar rees Hij omhoog
waar Hij huiswaarts keerde(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moon
All we can do
Is to assume

Our lives must change
A change is due
I hear you say
What are we gonna do

I don't know - make it
I don't know - shake it
I don't know - break it down

Oh, weeping night
Oh, grieving sky
Oh, rabbit wind 
You just flew by

Grant me this
Some small reward
Don't announce
The time of the final call

My dream was this:
Across the sky
A slate-grey cloud
That filled the eye

A slate-grey cloud
Comes through the dust
Locust

Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moonMy precious child, 
Won't you (finally) grant me your love 
My dearest treasure, 
Won't you (finally) please my desire 

Living and lying 
Crying out for you 
Where were you? 
Where was your sacredness? 

Take my fault (heartlessly) 
And set me free 
Take my fault (heartlessly) 
And set me free 

Take my fault - stay away 
Set me free - burn these chains 
Take my fault - stay away 
Set me free - burn these chains 

My precious child, 
Won't you (finally) grant me your love 
My dearest treasure, 
Won't you (finally) please my desire 

Living and lying 
Crying out for you 
Where were you? 
Where was your sacredness?(Instrumental)Restless in this Night, as I lay you down 
Here beneath the stars, No one else around 

You my only, my one desire forever more shall I give myself to thee 
Oh my precious one, set you free 

Cities buried deep, sun fades to final sleep 
Let us burn once more before we slip into the sea 

Let our ashes drift together 
Sign of love's true being 
In the darkest depths of the ocean 
Lies a place for you and me 
Forever more, we are freeIn mundo erat verbum

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless

As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Et mundus per ipsum factus est

As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Et mundus eum non cognovit

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaninglessWhen I go to sleep at night I try and try but I can't fight the evil visions that are
dancing in my head - are they hiding in my closet? Are they underneath my bed?

There's no telling what you'll find when you slip into the dark recesses of your mind
If you want a demon to do your dirty deeds, here's a simple recipe that you'll need
Put laurel leaves underneat your pillow and batblood on your eyelids to bring a demon to you
But remember this of all things I say: Once they're in your house they'll never go away!

Every night I dream of demons cuz they're hiding in the dark where no one else can see them
I dream, I dream of demons cuz they talk to me at night when no one else can hear them
Every night I dream of demons. I can see them in the shadows but no one else believes me
Every night I dream of demons... in the middle of the night I wake up screaming!

Don't drink water from the well on Wednesday, don't tempt fate no matter what your friends say
Cuz demons are real like you and me and if you let them they'll infect you and everything they see

Sleep never was a friend of mine cuz it's full of dead cats and porcupines
Each night I tell myself it's only a nightmare but I wake up and their eyes are everywhere!

Every night I dream of demons cuz they're hiding in the dark where no one else can see them
I dream, I dream of demons cuz they talk to me at night when no one else can hear them
Every night I dream of demons. I can see them in the shadows but no one else believes me
Every night I dream of demons... I can hear them in the closet & they're plotting & they're scheming

Every night I dream of demons cuz they're hiding in the dark where no one else can see them
I dream, I dream of demons cuz they talk to me at night when no one else can hear them
Every night I dream of demons. I can see them in the shadows but no one else believes me
Every night I dream of demons... in the middle of the night I wake up screaming!

I dream, I dream of demons... I dream, I dream of demons
I dream, I dream of demons... I dream, I dream of demons

I dream, I dream of demons... I dream, I dream of demons
I dream, I dream of demons... I dream, I dream of demonsThe first thing I saw...
Was a shadow of an evil sight
That was not all...
There was a growl which gave me a fright

Should I scream and call...
But what for, no ones out in the night
I would not fall...
Through my faith, I chose to fight

My choice was wrong...
Satan's power was stronger than mine
Demons strapped me down...
They slashed and tore my guts to drink with wine

Evil prophecies foretold
The day shall come, escape for none

Doomed to Death and Damned in Hell
Nothing left for me to tell
Doomed to Death and Damned in Hell

Now i burn in Hell
There's no escape, doomed for good
No more to tell...
This is the end, it's understood(Instrumental)Suffer, you will DIE

Violent climax, I wanted death

Furious hatred,

With your end comes relief

 

As I grab her throat

Her shock clouds her mind

But she soon realizes that my love lasts forever

 

Curse of my conscious

Relief in her death

Our love came first, our ashes will touch last

 

Her words could've changed me

Longed to caress her face

Fate would never let her love me but in death

 

The beauty in her eyes and the smell of her skin

As she held me the one and only time

Do you remember the feeling of the moonlight?

It touched your face in a way I'll never be able to

 

Curse of my hatred

Sorrow for her death

As she floats away, I love her for the last time

 

Place the body in water, a vicious liquid

 

Save me with your death...It grows again
Faces in the windows
One window without light
Weeping
Alone
In black park of bed
Handing back the ticket
Shadow of death
I kissed his shadow"Wallahualam, Shaitan!"Falling... Again 
Flooding... Pain 

Bleeding... Again 
Flowing... Pain 

I am The Labyrinth 
Master of Reality 

Living Labyrinth 
Flowing to RealityYou know that the fog is here omnipresent
When the diseaser sees no cure
You know that the fog is here omnipresent
When the intents remain obscure
Forevermore

Weave us of mist
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable wall-less maze
A secular haze

You know that his son is near omnipotent
When she sees eye to eye with spears
You know that his son is near omnipotent
When youth and innocence disappear
Forever lost

Weave us of mist 
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable, wall-less maze
A secular haze

He is divinity omniscient
Seeing the world revolve with spite
The surge of humanity oblivious
To the divine bringingeth light 
Let there be night

Weave us of mist
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Fog weaver

Come mist eternal

Come mist eternal

Come secular haze.The Dead walk amung us
Hooked up on life support
Buenos Dias Senoritas
prolong decomposition
animate a lie, A death alive

thank you very much, have a nice day
thank you!

Men Who Eat Men...Maka sabda Rasulullah, "Hai Iblis ! Siapa kekasihmu daripada umatku ?"  

Maka sembahnya Iblis, "Ya Nabi Allah ! Sepuluh perkara :  

Pertama-tama segala raja-raja yang aniaya 
Kedua pendita yang ingin akan dunia 
Ketiga saudagar yang khianat 
Keempat orang kaya bakhil 
Kelima orang yang minum arak dan tuak 
Keenam orang yang pada zahirnya baik batinnya jahat 
Ketujuh perempuan yang menyakiti hati suaminya 
Kelapan orang yang bersumpah-sumpah dustanya

 To my obscene pronunciation
 Somebody will take it
 For unpardonable abusive
 But Morbid Skies give you temptation
 Can you hear our Sweet Music
 Look into our dreams & imagination
 And you`ll can understand our Sweet Music
 We broken Through Morbidity
 We flown on wings of Eternity
 We roamed among
 Screaming entrails
 We burnt into Psychosis
 Somebody weeping in
 Dense Forests
 But this is unfounded tears
 Somebody seeking the Morbid Grubs
 But he find only Melodic Dance
 Somebody tell about the Fear
 But we know this is only empty words
 But somebody hearing and anjoy this uncommon sound
 And he knows here is our Sweet Music
 We have created our Mighty World
 We`ll don`t sell our Music for all blazing goldThe crowd was wild
The stars in a rage
Someone ate food off the food tray
He destroyed a couch
And fell out the window
The wife threw his spawn on stage
Its rattle in one hand, a mic in the other
It told songs of Armageddon
The Disney channel
Prophets of religion
Prophets who ate insects
The pit was wild with the sound
The whines of the child whipped
The emotions into a wild pitch
The spawn of couch destruction was hungry
As it left the stage
The diapers filled with horrid shit.(Instrumental)Un altro Culto Impuro

Don't think for one moment it ain't meant to be. 
Don't attempt to understand the agony. 
Don't mistake coincidence for destiny. 
No! 

A meaning of a number	 The tree of evolution 
A geometric figure	 The flower of life pattern 
A closing of a cycle The golden rules of nature 
When random turns to fate	 When random turns to fate 

By chance, or intention created? 
Mathematics or act of god? 

The holy archetype 
The finger print of god is on the face of reality 
Cannot believe it, taken above the ability 
Of comprehension 
The endless prototype 
Wake up call reality check, questioning what you believe 
Cannot get out of, a cycle a loophole 
Trapped in the same old 
Hallucination 

Chaos turns to order when random turns to fate! 
Chaos turns to order when random turns to fate! 

This world, that has been framed over our eyes. 
Wrapped around our minds, round our minds, 
Round our minds 
Round our minds 
Round our minds 

Don't open the door because there's hell to pay. 
Don't think for one moment it ain't meant to be. 
Don't attempt to comprehend the agony. 
Don't mistake coincidence for destiny. 
NO!!!!!Blast up
Hollow out
Gone south
Deliver this to the Cosmos for us
A flash of nearly
4 billion year-old light
Discovered recently in universal night
Run, kindred! arousing right hole but
Wrong mouth implodes
No remorse of wrong
Explodes with force strong(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Words of destiny,
Carried by the wind,
Whispered in your ears
They bear tears.

Looks like an Angel, with the Beast in the internal one.
wild and untamed, hated and beloved

These words come from a Creature,
At home in our heads.
And tell me what do you see
A wolf in a Lambskin?

Looks like an Angel, with the Beast in the internal one.
wild and untamed, hated and beloved

She seems like an angel
Behind her eyes it's dark and cold
The Beast waits for her Appearance
To take you all in her spell

She?s not what she seems
A vision in our dreams
look beyond her crystal eyes!
Adorned Princess, You're the keeper of the Brood.

Looks like an Angel, with the Beast in the internal one.
wild and untamed, hated and beloved

She seems like an angel
Behind her eyes it's dark and cold
The Beast waits for her Appearance
To take you all in her spellLiving in the wild
Fighting the odds
Ready to die 
In the name of  the Gods
Reaching the sky
While burning the ground
Stand by their rights
The king and  the crown

They'll win
They'll ride
With powers of wind and light
On a quest
To their promised land
 

Leading their troops
In the upcoming war
Stars are aligned
Their spirit will soar

They'll bleed
They'll cry
They'll plead
And some will die
They''ll win
They'll ride
With powers of wind and light
On a quest
To their promised landGeneration of immortals, 
reunion of the past and present day -(sorrow)-
State of perennial hypocrisy, 
nature cycle's inversion, self destruction I create...

Enslaved by the system, a future made for me;
I see every nation following a disgusting theory;
A mankind globally manipulated,
As I touch your emptiness, I try to understand...

A new world arises from the ashes of the world,
I know a dream that looses every form;
Look into my eyes there's no fear, there's no hope,
There's a child dead gone...

Eyes that control me, spread a new conception of humankind,
A new generation without needs and problems, sensation and feelings, 
Born to serve and obey.
Behind the scar of evolution a progressive performance
Of a future that looses every casual choice and conception,
A blind future of immortals...
A blind future of servants and fools...

Is this the heaven promised?
I'm cold and mouth dry;
I fear for something my mind can't realize;
Breeding a silent rage, no one can stop the new season,
No one canhear our roaring throats...

Leaving my life away - forever encrowned
Disgusting throne of a filthy god - forever immortal

Upset process of putrefaction (behind my fear)
Sub-crionic intent of survive (rise from the ashes)
Genetic procreation (of a strong kind (without losers)

Leaving my life away - forever encrowned
Disgusting throne of a filthy god - forever immortal

There's no fucking future for us!!!

Generation of imortals,  vomited cells in cancerous delay (syndrome)
Mankind generation, why I feel this pressure?
Why I feel this scum behind me?Like a child you cry and yuo reach out
In your hand
And one hundred bullets you shot'coz
They want you to
You want to kill, you do it for many years
Dying
Your father, dying your soul
Death's venom possessed your mind
Treason's call devours you like grave
For your ideal
You gave up
Belief in god
You inflict blow to your soul
It is too late
You must be
Orders given
Revenge fire caught you up
You see death
Now your life is your hangmanOh, in your depths I come to drown
all the fear I have to learn
it's my place on earth that's wrong
it's my death that is alone

How have mercy please of my long misery
let me stand by your tree of long disagree
slice my birth they been talking to my liberty
it's ephemeral any eternity...

Race at pain in the mind can will creep of life
race of barbars you're about to sleep for pray
what else  can you expect from
society in which way could you a 
wange your intelligence(Instrumental)The Black Death

In the year 1426
a godless world without any war
no churches who could spread lies
so humanity would never fail

Somewhere in a dark cold night
humanity became infected
by a decease called God
from this time the world was doomed to fall

The Black Death
Field of blood before you
Blame this mess on God
The dictator of today.

Churches were build, monuments of Christ
50 years of slavery and torturing began
War became a part of life
and all this because of Him

The Black Death
Field of blood before you
Blame this mess on God
The dictator of today.

Churches, Monuments of Christ
War, a terrible fight
Torturing, execution in the night
Slavery, a bloody sight

Nowadays religion is trying to rule supreme
forever there will be lies
until humanity fights for freedom
will it ever end?Floating upwards
Lungs filling up with air
As God inhales me
Into the impossible
I wave a sad goodbye
To each newly conquered territory

Nomad hearth
Consuming its own home
The glow of warm joy
Leaving dry form
Carcass Ashes

True will

Green life scraped from copper vaults
Silver pins in crippled cartilage
Ballooning substrate of eternity
Without reason's diamond
Without imagination

True will
Inhalation
Magnet charger
Lightning Blaze
Everything that ever was
Slightly changes

Green life scraped from copper vaults
Silver pins in crippled cartilage
Ballooning substrate of eternity
Without reason's diamondMan made. Designed to withstand unknown time. 
Monuments to the mind. Chambers to the hive. 
Once primed to host commerce. Or abodes, until adverse 
economic climates eviscerate them, silent. 

Until the architectural corpse resurrects, through the miracle of decay. 

Skin like paint peels away. Reveals flesh toned brick core. 
Metals return to the browns of earth. Rust is like raw dirt. 
(it) Paints its murals. Itself (is) its own tools. 

It strips the past away. 
The beauty of decay. 

In contrast with man himself, dereliction enhanced aesthetics. 
In contrast with man himself, the decrepit eschewed pathetic. 

(repeat parts 1&2) 

Statues worn through leprous decay. Limbs fell away. 
All whites now grey, brown or green shades. 
Wires left in pseudo botanical bouquets fall.There came a clamor among the sea of twinkling brine 
The hour approaches for a parallel reiteration 
And as I soared, the infinity birthed a hideous leviathan 
Enigmatic orb, eclipsing harbinger of Marduk's arrival 

O, Destroyer! Come and let them all be slain 
As Tiamat roars 
Infiltrate Earth, cast the ancients through the gate 
Tiamat - enraged 

Awakening beneath the cavernous pits of the Earth 
An ancient horde unearthing iniquitous offspring 
Just as I fall unto the sphere of azure below me 
My vessel astray, observer of this imminent collision 

This cosmic tract will provide as proper scenery 
For this monumental conflict to unfold 
Hark and remembers as time first stood still and had no name 
A divine conflict meant to seal eternal fate 
Tremendous creatures beckoned forth by ancient strength 
At last, primordial foes will step forth and engage 

The great serpent, the enormous wyrm(Instrumental) 

	WAR IN HEAVEN: THE FALL OF THE ANCIENT SERPENT 

"Maka timbullah peperangan di sorga. Mikhael dan malaikat-malaikatnya berperang melawan naga itu, dan naga itu dibantu oleh malaikat-malaikatnya, tetapi mereka tidak dapat bertahan; mereka tidak, mendapat tempat lagi di Sorga. Dan naga besar itu, si ular tua, yang disebut iblis stau satan, yang menyesatkan seluruh dunia, dilemparkan ke bawah; ia dilemparkan ke bumi bersama-sama dengan malaikat-malaikatnya."
-Wahyu 12: 7-9 / Revelation 12: 7-9Frequent atrocities, a habit of onslaught
Feasting upon limbs, of a non-Caucasian sort
An immodest being, unleashing his needs
Devoured by excitement, that comes with the deeds

This ivory with an ill disposed mind
Mutilates voraciously from the ebony kind

Inside 213
The horror breeds
Inside 231
Of the dead he feeds

While malign grabs his heart, and illness infects his mind
He takes away their pride, and coerce them to the other side
Collections of maimed parts, placed around in random
Repugnant sights distinguishes his repulsive acts

Bashed his first victim, at the age of eighteen
Several years after he made his frenzy killing spree

Inside 213
The horror breeds
Inside 231
Of the dead he feedsPrognosis for all patients is, death

He fights himself 

He is like a tree that refuses to be a plant 
he is like a wolf who deigns to be a animal

he is a spirit with evil senses

divided between fiction and reality

Lining up to breed?  Weaklings
Your insides are outside can't you see?
I'm laughing while blue bleeds, so happy

Where's my mind liar liar?
Cloned, mind massacred, shaped by plaster
Fear disaster and pray for time as I plead for freedom from me

Watch meek children cry
Come and try
Does weakness imply parental infanticide?

You know I'd rather hear the pitter-patter
But instead I gather and run

Watch it run
Watch it run

Watch it raise the slave(Instrumental)open the ceremony gates
someone's life will end tonight

I depend on thee

congest, blood overflows
rise the chalice, as he dies

The nigh is crawling it gives me a fright 
Creeping round with other men you haven't got a clue 
Wait 'til he finds out you'll see what he can do 
Cutting you from limb to limb ripping at your throat 
Spilling out your blood like a sacrificial goat 
Blood shot eyes stand out in the mist 
Don't double cross Jack you'll find out that hes pissed 

Blasting his way through the boundaries of hell 
You think you can destroy him? 
You better think again 
You begin to panic as your chances grow slim 
You better think again as the night is closing in 
I won't quit ripping them 'til I get put in chains 
For all that they do noones killed in vain 
Whores of the sreet he takes them in his grasp 
Charging men for sluts 
He'll cut you straight in half 

Last thing you'll hear will be the scream of a helpless old slag losing her Spleen 
Nothing helps you press to survive 
Keep oin running just to stay alive 
He's got you now the sadistic fuck 
Trapped in a nightmare 
Shit out of luck 
Sick old Jack forced you to death

Oh, you got to promise me,
that you will go the other way,
go ahead and choose hell instead

It's your blood,

yourrrrr.... tale tale...(Instrumental)Yes, he didn't come to me from another world
That beyond the horizon of mind
I overcame myself suffering from the pain
Barbed rain pouring from the sun
I carried away ashes of my own onto a mountain
Topless and with no name nor height
Mesmerized by the light flame inside of me
Paralysed by immobility

Bodies despaired of bodies always touch
Last walls by fingers of spirits still deceived
Bodies despaired of earth always hear
Entrails of being putrefy, anticipate

No, he stood on the high rock beyond the world
A balance, weighing up universe
Those who scorned body and earth, lies and truth
Who atoned, who invented heaven
They were sick, tired and lost in the future
Dying long for the expiation
Mesmerized by the light flame inside of me
Paralysed by immobilityA brazen head. Engraved with sigils. Emblems
The essence of ancient planets sealed within
When the moon is old
Shall evoke the servitors
I bid you enter this vessel
Feast upon the essences you so desire
Cast forth from the hosts
That serve your master
Behold your signs look upon this image
For it awaits you in silence
I have fashioned thee with my art
Unveil the secrets hidden
In the world of man
And the realm of Elemental SpiritsThey're jumping from buildings
and fall to the streets it's just an abstraction
Can't you see?
Are you desensitized
An American sheep
They're praying in church while the money burns at their feet

When warheads fly through the sky
Childrenare starving while days turn to weeks
There's kids out there with monkeys on their backs
When playing with fire do you just sit back and relax
Do you?

Impatient nations north of here, hunger to make history

With no means of trade, crushed is our maritime might
Foreign sandals upon our sands, will we last the night?

Five days or fifty years, we'll soon be fate's teeth
Impatient nations north of here, hunger to make history

What Gods do we turn to, which priestess do we believe?
The ones who clutch snakes, or those who point to the sea?

Every ship and sail swallowed by generous one
A naval nation's stay of execution

I can stop all that sorrow

Rescue me

I don't care about ___
I never stop my sorrow

Now the sun is fading
Everything is going right
Everything is going right

Now this time is over
Open your mind again
I walk outside
I just close my eyes
Now this time is over
Open your mind

I can't hide but I know
I see my dreams comes trueUh, I gotta go guys. I gotta go take a shower.

Ooohhh yeah... Yeah...

fuck you and your fucking life!
I want to slowly die!
I'm nothing!

In sorrow I travel
the long path of life
the trip seems so endless
are we living in a lie?
what is the purpose of all?
why were we created for?
when will this story end?
when will I finally reach my end..

I'm tired of seeing death!
how we destroy the world!
we'll die how we were born!

Father moon is breathing
Inside the comets
Eleven goats are gazing

Letters from the sun
Oceans are burning up
Wander thru the sky
Echos in the light
Letters from the sun
Oceans are burning up

Burning creatures and the stars are glow

Dancing beasts of a man of valour
Amen wind and wood are all wise
Oh you burnt and saw a mystick stag

Rites of the nether world
The crisis
Deepest chamber of the worldimmolate reliance: suffocate defiance.

nothing but germs.)
cardboard figure. skeletal man. in venomous confinement.

new dawning of fate. no exit from this torment. sickness and hate.
all in vain. everlasting suffering in pain.

Torturous gift bestowed
Newborn that is living
Denial to grow old

Fiery breath of satan
Death so near
Heaven is one with hades
For one you hold so dear

Chorus:
fingers of death, slowly surround
A shadowed white mist, that circles around
Detested hate, malicious fate
Taken, without a sound
Crib death

Innocent bliss
A precious sign of life
Scavengeous kiss
Meant for the young and trite

Life that is not given
Songs that go unsung
For one that is so young(Instrumental)Worshipped by the mindless,
they drag disciples to ruin.
Waiting for the right time
to empty someone else's pockets.

Proud of what they do, indeed.
Betraying the same hand that feeds them.
Victims after countless sins?
How can noone dare to see?

Can't believe the truth,
nor can withstand their lies.
Not so well concealed inside
that ill-conceived disguise.

Saints for many deeds,
whatever fits the bill.
Join your hands and pray for those
who live on what they steal.

Just look at what's inside,
hidden within the lines.Enjoy every breathing, amusement's your life
And you may be the gambling man around
The people say you are a never-do-well
But you just think that they belong in hell

You've never run for your life
You took the easiest way out
From the role that you play
(Forever you Know!)

(Chorus)
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Well, Heaven can wait...

But think a bit further, the older you grow
Won't you just your real face show?
You almost hide your mind behind a mask
And you forget your consciousness to ask

You've never run for your life
You took the easiest way out
From the role that you play
(Forever you Know!)

(Chorus)
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Well, Heaven can wait...

(Chorus)
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Heaven can wait! - But now it's too late
Well, Heaven can wait...
Well, heaven can wait!It's not reality - it's just like television
Return conformity and make your own decision
The writing's on the wall - let's have re-education
Go spread the word to all - and feel the new vibration!

From a hypnotic dream, I feel like I have woken
I'm not the only one - is the transmitter broken??
People begin to see now the system of control
Turn off - Drop out - it's time to save your soul!
And when you realize, more minds will start to follow
See, through the thin disguise, the reason for our sorrow

And when we've gathered numbers, we will have the solution:

Manifest our own potential - 
A form of retribution!!(Instrumental)[WHAT ON EARTH AM I HERE FOR?] 

What on Earth am I here for?
Trapped in this piercing circumstance
With no sign of hope to pull through
A nation full of parasites
And you don't know how much I hate this place
Countless sad stories of failed survivals
Every step is a miracle
I can't exist for no reason
Where there is a faith, there is a way
It is my test of guts and brain
Finding out how, in plan for my escape
Leaving this place as far as I could get

[THE HABIT OF FIRE] 

I've let myself floating away
My mind drifts out from my head
To look behind all these closed doors
Something seemingly unreachable

As I manage to move out silently 
from the community of hypocrites
My plan for escape is getting stronger
I should not belong here anymore

They have failed to spot me
Refused to join me
They will never see me
No way to stop me
Reaching out for another day
Marching on, pass without a sound
 
Time has come to approach an ideal state
where passion will finally get its place
Taking one good chance worth dying for
Never turn around

They have failed to spot me
Refused to join me
They will never see me
No way to stop me
Reaching out for another day
Marching on, pass without a sound

Fire is within me, I shall overcome, 
but it has never been an easy way
Each step I take requires a mature plan
and a bit of faith!

[SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS - Instrumental]

[A ROAD ABOVE, A ROAD AHEAD] 

Appended pathways
You never know their end, 
so we make one speculating choice
A route to somewhere
I left my past behind
to greet a hazy form of future
Taking a step as I walk

Trip of significance
They took 40 years to freedom
I wonder when will I get mine?
A faith so clear now
Either use it, waive it or leave it, 
yet we all know we always need it
Hurting my knees as I crawl

[FINDING A WAY TO STAND UP AGAIN]

(A road above, a road ahead - x4) 
And I shall never stop believin
In such a mode to recuperate
Future is given, but choice is mine
To find a way to stand up again
(x2)(Instrumental)You're proud of being poor
Nothing changes nothing
You eat your skin
Your soul never existed


Screw you and your world
Perpetually cut with lies
I could stand the pain
For long enough
But the taste is just
Too bitter(Instrumental)'K POOGH ZE T'ONTWYCKEN

(transl. Pali, 'the most excellent divine eye, eye of knowledge, all-seeing eye, Buddha eye, Dhamma-eye')

God's eye point of view, neither to be born nor to perish
Negation of substance, impermanence of being, everlasting become
Unconditioned mind, expressing absolute revelation of truth
Manifested beyond the transsubstantial

All being and nonbeing, neither mind or Buddha. In an all-embracing immanent end-in-itself, paradoxes are unveiled. Contradictions collapse, where boundaries failed. Plunging into the vortex of darkness divine, entering the voice where all things intertwine. This is the existence of the non-existence of duality expressing the radiance of ultimate reality.The worms are dying. Why are they are scattered on the pavement, like a broken jigsaw puzzle?

They are bloated.
They are pink like the corners of eyes.

Tragic and repulsive,
They writhe, and wriggle, and knot-
Great and terrible knots-
On the glossy, gray pavement.

We have left the hose on too long,
And now, the worms are dying.

Their brown faces...
Are crinkled like crushed oilcans,
And weeping fiercely,
But they haven't any eyes...
Or legs.

They are screaming.
The work... screaming.
And this is the place where some of the worms had withdrawn to die.

We are people!
We are people!

Their screams are inaudible.cold winter days, distant portrait reflects from the window

Turn to Bosnia, visit destroyed cities, ruins..
Try to count the corpses.

Try to appreciate, the atrocities of the war.
The mothers having children, of the soldiers rape...

The hunger in Etheopia, the Cholera in Zaire, the misery in Haiti, and the war in Bosnia.....Schmotz, schmotz, let it all out

I can barely say your name

Don't use it, if you can't feel it
ForgiveA form of blindness drove me here, into your arms, in a reckless moment. A kind of pity kept me here past my days, as kind as chains on a slave. Would it come as a shock, to find your bird has flown, having rediscovered flight in the grip of the noose? You're singing in the dark: a tether to your door. A second of remorse, as innocence creeps in. A shout in vain. The bastard's mother, you took nothing in. There's deception at the heart of you, cold heart, unbereaved. Blood on the ground beneath you, leaking down your legs to poison the bare earth, wherever you go. I'm never far behind. An unwilling father, you're everything I asked. You gave to me the flesh for life. Moving and breathing, the red flower in my veins; completely dead beneath the surface - flat eyes, hollow chest. You're raging at the dawn, a voice to crack the sky. Wherever I might go, you drag me by the neck. Did it come as a shock, when the collar, that fit so tight it would never come undone, was a means of escape, finally? I've left you far behind. In a secret life, we never met, and I had joy more than anything I've known. There's a secret home, down a thousand steps. Its door will open once, and shut me in alone.(Instrumental)Home of a dark fire where our slopes converge!   Under its
vaults I see you glimmering, motionless Douve, caught in the
vertical net of death.

     Masterful Douve, thrown down; to the march of suns
through funeral space, she accedes slowly to the lower levels.Tell me this be for you
How can I put into words what I feel
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
I'm losin' control!

Yeah, go, go, go! 

Yeah, he spent a little more time...
Your soul is like...

I'm trying to figure out the words to Shout
But I can't because I have bad case of gout!

Where did we leave off on this song?

It's like a river!
Cry me a river
'Cos I got a sliver
In my finger
The pain does linger
I'm not a very good singer
But that doesn't matter to me....

In the castle known to all - the Count's internal wife 
She invites the peasants with endless lavish foods 
But, when evening spreads it wings, she rapes them of their blood 
Countess Bathory 
Countess Bathory 

All day long the virgins sit and feast on endless meals 
The Countless laughs and sips her wine - her skin doth crack and peel 
But when nighttime fills the air one must pay the price 
The Countess takes her midnight bath with blood that once gave life 
Countess Bathory 
Countess Bathory 

Living in her self styled Hell, the Countess dressed in black 
Life's so distant - death's so near - no blood to fury time back 
The castle walls are closing in, she's crippled now with age 
Welcomes death with open arms - the reaper turns the page

Brings eternal fear

The time
To
To come to your senses
Got time
To fight for your life

Dim fire
Of your days is dying
Lightless time
Is still coming

No mercy
You cant count it today
Wake up man
And ring the bell

You rise and look up
Look forward where are you going

Fiery circle of human faults
Is closing there is no way back

Day of apocalypse
Is coming under your eyes
Hangman's shadow as a dark dream

To come to your sense
Got time
To fight for your life(Instrumental)On the verge of a soulside journey
On the verge of becoming something real
I'll bring you down
Lower than your level
I don't ever want to see your face againcan't hold this day
Anymore
Understand me
Anymore

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done

Ooh this uncertainty, is taking me over

I can't mould this stage
Anymore
Recognise me
Anymore

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done

Ooh this uncertainty, is taking me over
is taking me over

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done

Ooh this uncertainty, is taking me over
is taking me over
is taking me overAs silence howls I am no more
I've left this world behind so sore
Tired and sickened by it's faithful gore
The thoughts of might and sword amaze no more
The forest stops to tell my tale in lore
Tells it to a long dead bore
No life, no sight, the light ignored
This lake has swallowed and buried me whole
I reek of mith that's told no moreDrawn awake by a loss of breath 
Feeding the glow dancing on the tapestry 

In his mind a feeling stirs 
Something seeping, something strange 

An acid stench of ash rising from the bottom floor 

Bright notes appear, vibrating in the light 

In the depths of his home his mistakes are held high 
In here there is peace and clarity 

Brought down from his fear and desperate hopes 
This death comes expected and without loss 

Nothing will be saved for me, all shall be lost 
And with reawoken purpose he stares at the abyss(Instrumental)Gargle your gravestone
and swallow your fear,
falling into the shadows
of gods whom your fear.
relentless your journey to the place
of his rest,
like a demon you must avenge his death
how can we go .. What has been witnessed

Watch the dead dance 
on the front line of war
there swollen eyes
will bleed no more.
Gripping their souls before
they break the grey skies
back to the trenches
is where they must lie.
Knee deep in offal Skinned and salted in hell
no one to control
his infernal will.

At the heart of the battlefield
my comrades fell so deep
open your eyes to this demonic creation
the war machine that has savaged your soul.
Fallen brethren, lay waste beside me
their rotted flesh, it stings my nose
their names shall forever live 
but since their destruction, 
my mind shall forever burn.

This battle has again come to life
in my dreams, a wanton fight.
I struggle to gain wake
to abort this undesirable moment.
I dig into my soul, to remember the painIn this extreme repugnant boredom 
I pace around and see the world through misanthropic eyes 
As I want the world to break down into pieces 
My inner self reflects visions of hatred 

Condemnation of futile beings 
In rapture I choke everyone in my way 

Visions of deterioration 
My mind controls decay through thoughts 
Visions of human demise 
I will nail mankind through death by hand 

Raping the earth like the immodest human I am 
A departure in solitude makes me what I've become 

An entangled earth covered with fear 
Schizophrenic anger is what I hear 
I kneel before the prince of my inner rage 
Welcome to the deterioration age 

Visions of deterioration 
My mind controls decay through thoughts 
Visions of human demise 
I will nail mankind through death by hand(He's reading it out of a magazine.)Are you searching for knowledge 'bout godlike life?
'Bout fate, 'bout might and 'bout pain. 
Are your axioms hard enough to be proved?
To rail against heaven and god

Open your mind for the journey beyond
Only there you will find your own god
At the end of the rainbow lies the answer
That you've searched for so long

You won't have opportunity, to perform your wisdom
'Cause your knowledge will be your cage(Instrumental)You and me,
just the two of us,
no one to talk, no one to bother.
Make me sane.
Release me from the pain.
Increase the feeling of desire.
No control.
Pushing to the edge.
Never stop, I'm getting closer.
No regret
about the memories,
they'll be forgotten once it's over.

Take me to the highest place
and let me be the king for just one day.
I need to fulfil my pressure.

Go, go, go,
you don't wanna stop
until the universe flips over.
Burn inside.
Immune to the outside.
I'm raising up and getting stronger.
More, more, more,
everything takes more,
and so do I to spit myself out.
Don't let go.
You got to make it grow.
Before it takes me to the brake down.

Take me to the highest place
and let me be the king for just one day.
I need to fulfil my pressure.

Hurt me, I am made of scars now.
Heal me, you won't kill me anymore.
I need to fulfil my pressure.

More elation,
to break this pressure.

Take me to the highest place
and let me be the king for just one day.
I need to fulfil my pressure.

Hurt me, I am made of scars now.
Heal me, you won't kill me anymore.
I need to fulfil my pressure.

Love ya, c'monComplacent Penitence:

Useless waste of the laws of nature
Wraiths of no value
The cycle of existence reduced to two variables
Shells of former promise

Content in the Grave

Walking corpses infest the world
Evaluating the crypts Finding that the bodies
Are not among the dead
Satisfied in their complacent penitence
Ever gazing windows into futility

Content in the grave

Slowly giving life to the void
Seeping away
Demonic efficiency
Trading all receiving nothing
This the only embrace
They revere(Instrumental)(Instrumental)A call to battle...all is lost
This was the war to end all wars
Mines & wires lay across the land
The killing fields seemed to never end
In the trenches they will make a stand
Millions died with blood on their hands

Hmmm...
We know!

They fight, they died, surrender!
We lived, survived, remember!

Nations vie to settle scores
While they hide behind their castle walls
It's such a tragic tale of war
Pushing men to their very edge
They fight blindly till the end
Through blood & sweet...the fear of death...

We know!

They fight, they died, surrender!
We lived, survived, remember!

Genocide by war machines
Inventive madness gone obscene
No mercy given and no quarter claimed
Bodies rotting where they lay
The lies continue...who's to blame?
So much madness...so much pain!

Never to return!

Never to return!!

They fight, they died, surrender!
We lived, survived, remember!All the world is aghast.
Hell on earth is unleashed.
Devil's smoke and flames are everywhere.
Thousands of innocent people inside
the madness,
They try to get away, they run over
each other.
The giant buildings are falling down
and all is buried in the debris and dust.

Happy faces are changed into 
hatred and crying.
Peace and contentmentare turned into
fear of war over the whole wide world.

The attack on democracy unites all
countries and
nations for war against evil.
When negotiations are collapsing
it is the time for revenge.

Violence against violence.
Hate against hate.

We are building the peace
on our evil planet earth
with the help of arms, bombs and anthrax.I heard
That you're settled down
That you
Found a girl
And you're
Married now

I heard
That your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend
Why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
"Don't forget me," I begged
"I'll remember," you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead."
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead,
Yeah.

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday
It was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
"Don't forget me," I begged
"I'll remember," you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead."

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known
How bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
"Don't forget me," I begged
"I'll remember," you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"

The warmth inside
Falling into oblivion
Floating on a cloud so high

Want this feeling
All the time
To have this feeling
Is to die

All I want is more

Close your eyes
Visions of heaven
All around you

Is to die

All I want is moreCrouching in the dirt like animals
Afraid to see the light of day
Your sort only deserves one thing
And I'll bring it to you!

Abominations - crime against God
Never supposed to come to life
Conjured up by Devil worshippers
To punish us, make our lives miserable
But I won't tolerate

Rise like the rank weeds of summer
Unworthy creep
Polluting our wells by insanity
Many of us are still righteous
We'll bring you to justice
Your swamp will not stand our test
By the full light of day
You'll see us come

Pests in pools of stagnant water
You breed, you erupt like
Pests in pools of stagnant water
Hideous, poisonous, bloodsucking
Pests in pools of stagnant water

Take them to town, tie them up
We'll use the pole, right in my yard
Ain't no layman, I know the gospel
Better than he - the impostor

Spreading disease among the young
Now let them burn befoe it's too late
They'll impregnate their Devil seed

(Chorus)Traveling down a deserted path
Nescient of the abstract

Then suddenly we slip into
An alternate reality

Everything is speeding up
Ascending into spacetime

The autumn forest around me
Has turned into black
Dark creatures begin to surround me
There is no turning back!

Colorful shapes appear before me
Shifting infront of my eyes
Beaming light entrancing
As we take flight!

Supernatural visions
of our future...
Awakening!

Paranormal revelations
of Extraterrestrial...
Relations!

Shapeshifting reptilians
with malevolent...
Agendas!

Flying objects in the sky
Millions within my eye
We are all about to...
Die!!

Speeding back into spacetime
Decelration of vibration.Shadows are upon me, countless spirits... 
Legion, they call themselves. 
The fell ones follow my footsteps through time... 
Grasping for my heart... 
They have taken my vision from me.
I have nothing left...
But my enemies have overlooked my faith in the One above. 
Fruitless are their attempts to prosper against me, for the flame of the living Christ dwells within me. 
My Father, whom I served, died for me.
Eternal protection I have been given against you. 
Through His sacrifice, you have been defeated.
Forever the flames will devour you, o angel of music. 
To the depths with you and your followers!
Satan, you are damned
You are dead...
And I am dead to this world.
O, Lord Jesus, receive us into your kingdom. 
May Your glory shatter the universe...The time of total madness has arrived
Bid farewell to your world of values
You can not predict what waits around the corner
Will there be light of will darkness lead your way
Not a prayer nor the praise can help you on the path towards truth
In this battle there is no victory just those with nothing more
In this world there is no god in ourselves we are one part of it
The power is all and everything and the evil eye looking over it
The ultimate strenght starts where the weak cannot grow
On the rays of victory we reign
From the ruins we will start a new eraPutrid feed
from the forest trough
stubby hands claw
damp dead foilage

Torch - light unmasks
distorted mugs
grinding molars
Midgets of evil

Buried delicacy
slobbering hybrids
sick the tainted marrow
lick the carrionThe slow approach of winter after winter
The turning seasons wither in my head
The weary fluctuations of time and distance,
Forgetfulness and dying
The grey king no longer clings to that which dies
The imagination is lonely at the great thought of death
Black void of loneliness

NOW!I'm going to grow Wyoming hair
My parents sit on fat chair
They don't care -- care!
Rockers are growing Wyoming hair
We bang our head -- bleed
We see girl -- spill seed
We like cake -- need!
Wyoming hair, clothes of tweed!
My dick is Montana grown
My brother's voice -- a monotone
Don't tell me cut your Wyoming hair
I'm nail you on a cross and piss on you
Nail you on a cross and piss on you
Rockers are growing Wyoming hair(Instrumental)No, there's no fucking way
That anything's going to change
It depends on you and you know
We can protest until death, they won't listen
Don't sit back and think it will happen
They won't give up what they have robbed
Stand up and resist

But while the leaders have caught on, we see that they've prepared for civil war
While on our side we squabble about who does what and who sells more
There's women with just one reason, to fight for their equality
Forgetting the system holds superiority

First, we've got to come together, so fuck the differences
It doesn't matter if its noise or music, to them we all talk piss
To them we're the sick farce, now lets not prove them right
If we're to stand the slightest chance, we must unite and fight
We must never give up, make sure our message ain't forgotten
That's if they won't fucking stop, then we're gonna fucking stop them!Howling winds and eerie sounds follow you where ever you go
Remember the curse
Remember the curse
Mist in the valleys of death
Smoke of the funeral fire
Remember the curse
Remember the curse
No one you can trust
Nothing to live for
Remember the curse
Remember the cursePure disease, a chasm of souls
parasites of endless things, in divinity's well
Infected with curses, the flames of God
Imperial races, Chaos Enthroned

Marvels like snails
a wheel of depression
Dehumanizing the shaded breed
to zero and one

Generators of plague, never ending mind control
diagramming the spheres of the seashell
In the source of all evil, the ultimate devastation
A torrent of existence

Chaos Enthroned

The space is bleeding, with the hate from the race of Memes
universal prototypes, an open door to infinity
Insected with corpses, the apostolic wrath
Etherial crossing, Chaos Enthroned

Cyclones and storms
the last days of humanity
This corrosion in perfect design
to zero and one

The Action, Reaction, dementia like a maze
Creation, Corruption, the universe in haze
The balance, Imbalance, the edge of obscure realms
A zero, Subhero, the life of human breed

Chaos EnthronedLove and hate split everywhere
All the ashes in the air
Someone plase come take my hand
Hold me while I die in pain
All the echoes still remain...

No one screams, no one cries
And my tears fall and disappear
In the still hot land
No one's born, no one dies
And my tears fall and disappear
Take away all the memories
And the silence embrace my faith
Taking hold of the last trace

It was yesterday
When I opened my eyes for the first time
It was yesterday
When I became one of them for my whole life
But it is today
I'm passing away, through all this pain
For the last time
And it is today
When all the echoes still remain
And it's all gone

Voices of millions, echoes of no one
Worthless ambitions, wasted emotionsCradled in the moonlight with widespread wing, their song a haunting call. They are faint visions of my Spectral Eyrie.The day when my breath will expire
the universe will too, so it means never
inside you all I will light my fire
a fire that will forever burn... for me

I possess your souls, souls of emptiness
I'll repair your minds and make you my slaves

the sky is red like blood, my heart is black and def
I bless you all, under my sword, I'm fierce, I'm cursed,
I'm the lord

I'm the eternal ruler, and so I will always be the same
cause I will burn inside you all as an eternal flame
my veins are burning, and blasting out the light
now you can see what is left of my crying heart

necromancer is what I am
with enthusiasm you pronounce my name
I'll ensoul you all inside, I gave you my sign
I can do whatever, cause you are all... mineTotal transformation
She becomes a headless monster
Tormenting endlessly
With thoughts that wonder mindlessly

All love becomes war
All history a root of hatred

Threat of violence fills the air
The reaper is always present
No one sees inside
No way out from hell

Sleep with one eye open
Ready for random attacks

Never ending
Insanity
No victory
No glory(Instrumental)Black magic rules the land
Woods are burnt by Satan
Fouled corpse of human beings
Orcs roam through ashes
Ashes of sanity - overcasted sky above
Satan's fortress all days

Lord keeps all souls in fortress of fear
He collects spilled tears 
- Symphony of hate beginsInfiltrate, penetrate, debilitate
Sterilize, immobilize, terminate
Infestation of the host

Taken by surprise with
Fear
Look of shock so telling...
Lies
Told me I meant something
Scared
Revenge will be mine now
Tied
To a table where you're
Soaked
Gasoline will cleanse you

 

Beg
Tell me what I want to
Hear
Making a new story
Eyes
Pried open with steel clamps
Watch
As I grab the matches
Scream
As the spark ignites you
Laugh
At the sounds that you make

 

Hearing the color of your mind
Burning what's left inside

Weighing my choice against the tide
Caring no more for the time
Dimming all rays of hope
Death moves so slow

As your remains are lifted and taken
To the water where your eyes stole my mind
I can't help but think your love wasn't real
Memories of you can save me from myself
I can hear your voice saying "Don't let me DIE"
At the water where your eyes stole my mind...Coalinga knows how to party
Coalinga knows how to party
Unlike the city
Of Avenal
Unlike the city
Of Kettleman City
Unlike the city
City of Kerman
We keep on rocking
From wheelchairs rolling

Let me welcome everybody to the center of the west
The city that's protected us as if it were a nest
The health care we receive here is the best
Pretty nurses shoot us up with winks suggesting sex
We were born here and died here yet we're still alive
Selling retread tires and colored ice to survive
We clip coupons on the weekend take 'em to the store
Double value on Tuesdays; so you save even more.

I've been in this town since before Taco Bell was serving
Back when the local food left your belly churning
But now we got chains and we're gonna use them
We record tracks in their motherfucking bathroom

It's all good
For the people in this town
Shut the fuck up,
The sky here isn't brown
Blow a gasket
As you pass on through
Your car'll never make it
You've got some spending to do

Coalinga knows how to party
Coalinga knows how to party
Unlike the city
Of Avenal
Unlike the city
Of Kettleman City
Unlike the city
City of Kerman
We keep on rocking
From wheelchairs rolling
Save us, save us please
save us save us
Save us save us please
save us please
Save us, save us please
save us save us
Save us save us please
save us please

Out on the streets of Coalinga
We still get stares
You think they'd be used to rockers
In metal wheelchairs
They've seen us in the paper
But still they're not all proud
Like that old man who sets his hearing aid too loud
He called the cops when he saw light still on
At Taco Bell at midnight he said he heard a sound
The police showed up and pulled the plug at a quarter past
We had just begun to lay down our latest tracks.
They busted our asses and hauled us off to jail
Charged with trespassing, Mrs. Johnson posted bail.
Now we gotta go to trial and defend ourselves
Fight these motherfucking attorneys from Taco Bell
Say what you say but locals came out on our behalf
Despite all these Kerman Christians
With their anti-metal tracts
We're still alive unlike Terry Kath
Pretty nurses in bra and panties
Give us sponge bathsEvil, wicked, distorted warped minds
Live amongst the human kind
Source of evil from below
Not from the church, or cathedral 

Out in the fields they gather around
And form a circle for the mass
Worship demons. devils, darkness of the night,
You can hear them call

Hale Bahr Moth spirit of the dark
Take thou my blood, my flesh, my skin and walk
Holy Bahr Moth father of my life
Speak now, come now, rise now
From the forest, from the fallows, from the fields and live...

Sacrificial death by the cross
To strengthen the cult for further mission
To overtake the Churches of God
Replace with Evil and Hale Satan
Dying wil be done on earth
As it is in Hell...
So prepare to face your doom
'cause no more I will tell...

from the beginning of all creation,
it has been an order...
when or where we will be called to exist and to demise.

All is in control but not ours,
the law, free will, I give you...
know what it means: "The highest creation"
given to us freedom and authority,
wisdom and knowledge, and enough brain
to think and to learn, to grow with self-sufficient.

The law, free will, I give you,
won't you realize of your existence?
All is the best for you,
now as became the fallen ones,
you are unable to think even for yourselves.
How can you start to doubt Me in the minds?

With your hearts that turn to stone,
I can understand what pains you feel away from My presence.
I never blame you for your fragile minds,
now I give you My Word to know Me easier.

Words that fit to the sick
Words that fit to the disabled
Words that fit to those who doubt
Words that fit to the ignorant
Words that fit to the weak
Words that fit to the arrogant
Words that fit to all of us.Uz jsem davno spal, bodnul mne komar

Sea of faces, twisted and tortured

As waves crash onto hopes and dreams
Bleak future
The faces they watch me as they writhe in horror
Pain is all they can hope for
Eternal suffering

As fresh cold blackness envelopes me
Succumb to the force
Washing over you in an instant
Drowning in the sea of despair

As waves crash onto hopes and dreams
Bleak future
The faces they watch me as they writhe in horror
Pain is all they can hope for
Eternal suffering(Instrumental)A challenging task out from the mind of the visionaire
Recalling all melodies created in those dreams
Cathartic responses, the popping out from the nerves
through this musical kind of free association
I have tried to submit and to submerge to the system
But something inside me wanting me to be insane!
 
Is it the message from outer space?
No, I think it's just me tired of everything

Here is the moment to break free
Free to express our deepest thoughts
Now is the time to elaborate
all those past hesitations
Into something
Into something
Into something lunatic, but awfully honest

Here is the moment to break free
and bring all these fresh storms of brain
Now is the time to give some edge
Fighting against the guardians of mediocrityMind swirling high above 
Yearning beyond 
Yet those shackles you created sink deep 
Thoughts locked in a death grip 
Beaten and battered 
Thrown against the walls 
Of the worlds that bind us 
To flesh to remain 
Long has your gaze searched 
Wandered through the skies 
For anything to reflect 
The fading shine of your life onto 
Lingered here wondering 
Whether any of the misery 
Came even close to bear a trace 
Of what could be seen divine 

Withering mortality 
Revival faced only in flames 
Stand the ground resolute 
Whatever fate there may befall 
In this end-time masquerade 
By the rule of those of might 
Old faiths to be lost 
Through embers red our paths will cross 

Witness these pyres 
Gather the will to burn 
With splendour seen by none 
For a thousand human lifetimes 
The sons of ages past 
Share a breath of that same 
Strength in ashes 
In the air and on our tongues 
Luminous apparitions 
Emerge and point the way 
From which we could uncovThe time has now begun for life to flow straight to me
I feel that true reflection has brought me to where I am
And now the time that has gone by has shaped the man that you see
I've had my wings tainted with the eyes of mortal men

No begging will gain you
The prize that you are seeking
the only way to gain what you want
Is through discipline through yourself

Seek it
Want it
Take what you need
Do what you want to do
Take what you want to be

Take my strength through discipline

The only way to disengage the chain
I taste the flame I never knew the way
The only way to do what I did
And reframe and I take the blame

And I take this stand and I walk alone
You would not be there for me when I need you
The thoughts that were made, the life that was not
Point to the stars, I would beg them again
Warped were your friends and your wonderful life
No never again I won't love

And I take this stand and I walk alone
Never again didn't want the same
Thoughts were confusing the life that we had
Where were you when I needed you by my side?
Never again this I deny
I start my life, I walk aloneJust shut the fuck up!

Devoid of heart
Devoid of mind
Devoid of all 
That will define

This is not living
Never began
Empty husk that
Once was man


Imprisoned in the darkness
No solace for the soulless
No rest for the wicked
Nor direction for the aimless

You think you know pain, you think you know sorrow
You know nothing of suffering in the realms of the psyche
When all you love is stripped away, forced into a chore
When the ability to hope has been torn from your core

Why, you ask, do I keep living? You call this living? 

You call THIS living?
Death is far too easy.


It doesn't matter there's nothing worth my time
You can try to motivate and threaten all you like
But I am one that has lost everything, the essence of humanity
Will never dwell within this shell, a cold and empty shell

That cold and empty shell 
That once resembled man(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Freezing, melting, freezing
Losing, finding, seeking
Coiling this endless string
To never face the spring

No past and no future
Only crippled circles of nature
Limping through slush and spleen
All diluted and dull and clean

Birds fly backwards
Beast vomits prey
Every scale is bursting
A seed made of clay
A sun is pale and weak
A moon is ablaze
A tide is turning
I do not know my face

See the blossoming flowers and the frost
See the useless birth and loss
See the snow so dark and gray
Light the night, kill the day

I try to find the world through this pane
I see myself and I feel the pain
Veiled reflections to undergo
The face of Prometheus I now know

The longest wave
Is this walk
Between the light
And the shadow
The longest wave
Is this walk
Between the light
And the shadow(Instrumental)The speed of our decay is an extreme visualization of our beliefs. Like rotting cunts and the taste of burnt pubic hair trying desperately to change our fanaticism. The only thing that they ever accomplish is to give us a taste of our home. We worship because of our hate, hate of the knowledge that there are those out there ready to worship. We kill out of nothing, nothing is a reason better
than nothing.The skies go black 
A shadow is cast upon the earth 
As the darkness gives birth to a cosmic entity 

Beings from a realm unknown 
Reign from above to annihilate 
Creations of an ancient race 
Built to decimate 
They have sealed our fate 

From this day on, the world will suffer endlessly 
The human race is now a distant memory 

Machines from another galaxy 
Bring the end of the populace 
Souring the earth for signs of life 
None will be spared 
For mankind's time has come 

None will be spared 
They've sealed our fate 

All traces of our kind, forgotten 
A karmic decimation of the human race 
Plunge the earth into utter oblivion 
Erase the world of all existence 

The automatons leave quick as they came 
In search of life amongst distant galaxies 
They will not stopThroughout time we've been blinded by
Those from the sky!

(chant)

We all must open our eyes
Then we shall arise
Humanity!

Are you awake?

All stand up and defend your rights
Before they're gone!
Our leaders have betrayed us all
Lashing out in vein attempts
To take us down!
But we must fight back
For the sake of our children!

(chant)

Fighting and lying
We are all trying to save ourselves!
Bombarded, assaulted
Progression haulted

We will overcome
The battle has just begun
Humanity will overcome
When the battle is won

Fighting the battle for humanity!

We must open our eyes
Overcome gods from the skies!Die Wiederkehr

[Ref.]
Am Himmel stand die Sonne tief.
Das rot des Himmels trankte den Wald.
Die Erde bebte bei der Wiederkehr.
Ihre Bestimmung war es zu sterben.

Nach einer langen Schlacht,
in welcher viele Krieger starben.
Legte man sich zur Ruh.
Keine Rache war zu erwarten.

Die Erde ist getrankt von Blut.
Wer wohl jetzt in Frieden ruht?The battle that rages inside of your mind
As you struggle to silence the fire
The flames of passion that seduce you
And fuel your desire to consume
All you've been given at once
Reaching out to grab a hold
Of the hand that would be my salvation
Just out of reach
I meet your eyes as your image fades away
And it seems I had been chasing nothing but a ghost

So tell me what do you believe
About the war inside my head
Innocence is dead
There is a monster in you

Someone please
Take my hand and guide me out of this place
Away from the memories and pain
Left to wonder yet again
What would the world be like if we were dead
And nothing but our ghosts were left

So tell me what do you believe
About the war inside your head
Innocence is dead
There is a monster in me

This perspective
Is not mine alone
So please open your eyes

With the fires all around us
How can we deny all we know? 
Do we have to lose all that we had
Before we recognize our flaws?
So tell me what's the difference
Between the hero and the thief
To survive in this dying world 
We all will struggle to stay free

There's nothing left for me
Just ruins and remains
And if you're listening
It's stopped making sense to meTake Your stupid glasses
and take your stupid hair
take your queer backpacks
and get the hell out of here
Burn your pussy lyrics
You'll never get pussy!
Your girlfriend broke up with you
'cuz you're a damn wussy

Emo Is For Bens!

You can't even play punk
and that's fucking bad
and you cry over women
and that's more sad
you dress so god damn queer
Just to hide that you are gross
So now you write songs
About how you're a joke!

Who appeared as an incarnation
To protect religious principles
Protect me from the dirt of the age of KaliWe look to the all-seeing eye and see not the rotten soul festering within. We hunger for enlightenment and comfort, yet starve before searching. A whore, you are, for lies and bribes offered as bait by your captors. Light shall never warm the misled droves; they shall remain frozen, stagnant, lifeless... as a means to ignore the truth. Aim for destruction and savor your ignorant suicide. I call for an end to this pain. I cry out for our suffering to manifest and smear it's putrescence across the face of its perpetrators.Life, an endless endeavor. 
I need to seek the true potential of a grocery store. 
I lack the resources, the funding to get my needs and wants inclined. 
Leave it all behind and take it as it comes. Words now spoken 
aloud just to hold your tongue. Decisions that can't be made, thoughtful incantations. Out of luck without a buck, no time for relaxation. I need to get out of this house, they say I need to watch my mouth. Oh no. 
I die inside to know I've left behind the times of true peace. The least of my worries is now survival. The way is dark. The way home. 
I smell so bad, I feel I have no purpose. A cripple left by society. I am a money-less dreg, I'm worthless. Unshaven goat of a man, revolting. Bills aren't paid, my feet are numb (I fit no criteria) I am their only son (Yet still I scramble) Breathing in the corporate being (To escape my poverty) Living all of my time sleeping (I must be free) There must be something unseen about me that's disgusting, and renders me incapable of being employed. It's time to sell my soul to the workforce. I am going to cut my hair.(music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Buratto) 

In these days you're feeling broken down
Feels like the walls are closing in on you
In these days you're really out and down
you just want to feel alright

This is a song, it's just my way to say "believe in you"
This is a little thing to say "believe in what you do"
Come on free your fist to hit

//chorus
Let's go now! Don't throw in the towel!
This is your round! Nobody rings your bell today
Wake up now! Don't run for cover!
Open your eyes, this is the time to shoot to kill

Hey, there is this kind of magic
in a dream that only you can see
When you think "there's no way out now"
let your dreams go some more

Listen to me my friend, you must react... it's a brand new day
listen to me my friend, don't care about what some people say
don't live or die that way

//chorus

There will always be someone who talks badly about you
Live how you want and do what you want!
Our life is like a concerto without previous rehearsals
Live intensely, laugh, sing, dance and let yourself go
before the lights go out... And the show ends...

This is a song, it's just my way to say "believe in you"
This is a little thing to say "believe in what you do"
Come on free your fist to hit

Let's go now! Don't throw in the towel!
This is your round! They won't ring your bell today!After thou hast annihilated everything, --when naught remains but empty space,--thy coffin shattered and thine arrows broken, then make thyself a crown of stone from heaven's highest mount, and cast thyself into the abyss of oblivion. Thy fall may last a million aeons, but thou shalt die at last. Because the world must end; Till then, my glorious steed, thou shalt run thy course; thou mayst please thine ear with the crunching of the heads crushed under thy feet. Thy course is long, but courage! Long time hast thou carried me: but longer time still must elapse, and yet we shall not age. Stars may be quenched, the mountains crumble, the earth finally wear away its diamond axis; but we two, we alone are immortal, for the impalpable lives forever! But to-day them canst lie at my feet, and polish thy teeth against the moss-grown tombs, for Satan has abandoned me, and a power unknown compels me to obey his will. Lo! the dead seek to rise from their graves. Satan, I love thee! Thou alone canst comprehend my joys and my deliriums. But, more fortunate than I, thou wilt some day, when earth shall be no more, recline... Man has his tomb, and glory its oblivion.(Instrumental)Ambisi... penuh... distorsi...

You can't tell us what to do
You can't keep our feelings locked inside
If you do we'll come right back at youShe's the devil with amazing breasts.
He's a dreamer, when he dreams of flawless escape.

[He's not alone, that seems to be enough]

I am a machine.
A shell of what I dream.
I am you.

Crush us with high heels and "coach" bags, please...
Fuck my brains out, innocence is out of style...
(Note: this changes the way I dream)

You coward... Waiting, memorizing me.

Here: here's the helping hand holding a grudge

Looks like im the joke this time.

Incoming (worthless) message
[Please stand by]

Im trying to help you
[Please stand by]

Please stand by, everythings a test.
Please stand by, you're a fucking test.

Trauma is god.
God's hand pushing me away.

Im trying to help you...

You cried out softly, that you "had to feel one soft song to end it all". So, I found the peace in melody...It's just a second and this all crash
You made room for life but they blind you
It's just a moment when you all scream
They're marching across the sand and through happiness

Silent waves I only hear them bleeding
The day has turned to darken the end
You cannot stand yourself
Struggle to keep all together

Why can't I feel my legs
Why can't I breath this open air

Opposite of fantasies ticking
Counting bodies of the loss
Mother Earth will serve the rich
As the death brings the silence

Silent waves...

Struggle In Disarray
Can't breath this air
Beseech to cut my life
Struggle In Disarray
Can't breath this air
Beseech to cut my life and let me
Struggle In Disarray
I can't breath
Struggle In Disarray
Can't breath this air
Beseech to cut my life and let me

It's like a family you've never met
Can't find no words no language to speak
It's not a reason for what they've done
Enemies of well-to-do, Hysteria

Why can't I feel my legs
Why can't I breath this open air

Struggle in...The moonlight shines, lightning up the dark road 
Crystallized phantoms roam in the trees 

Like dancing shadows they come 
Chantings in the wind 
Young maiden of Artemis 

She will take your heart to the oracle 
The huntress awaits now for your soul 

Mystical dryads in the woods 
Nymphs of forests lost 
Their voices come closer now 

Naiad that protects the lake 
Her ardent spells domain 
Eyes that shine in the day await 
Across the lake of the Limnades 

A dream of fate warned me 
Through the dark of the night 
Oh, see that ahead 
Is it the light, so bright 

Shrine maidens follow heed time after time 
A centennial festival arranged for magical girls 
A Maiden's capriccio she cast within me, the nymphs dance away 
Possessed by a lascivous spell 

Only when you find yourself 
And encounter the truth 
Will the nymph of the woods 
Show herself onto you 

She will take your heart to the oracle 
The huntress awaits now for your soul 

And so the story unfolds 
In a wheel of light 
Her spirit forever roams 

Naiad that protects the lake 
Her ardent spells domain 
Eyes that shine in the day await 
Across the lake of the LimnadesYou say that he will come
Once again
And his mission is to rule the world
Wake up from your dreams
Face reality read my lips
Second coming never Christ denied forever Jesus dead

You think that he will come
Once again
So you can walk the clouds
Let me kill your dreams
As we speak this will never be

This I have heard before
New dates new years new lies
This I have said before
Your lord will never rise

Forever nailed

Still you live your dreams
High on hopes
For the second coming of your Christ
Your world above the clouds
Are erased and destroyed
Second coming never Christ denied forever Jesus dead

Crying on your knees
When you see
No coming of your Jesus Christ
Holy bible bleed
And I see
The world is dead in your eyes

This I have heard before
New dates new years new lies
This I have said before
Your lord will never rise

Forever nailed

Jesus will not come
No
Jesus will not come
Second coming never
He won't rise
Christ will never walk again
Dead on his cross. No rise for ChristThe quake hits - reigning flames -
arising clouds - shaking ground

Starting to run - escape from death
Hopeless - in this destructive mess

Cruel awakening... trembling fear... ground cracks open
Fire's creeping toward us... violently raging on
Pandemonium... sudden death... enter chaos 
The creation of mankind... utterly destroyed

The dust clears away... humans died
Constructions blown away... panic starts
Like a deadly plague... breeding threat
Effects of the quake

A strike without a warning
No time to mourn for the loss
Scenes of terror and death
The storm before the calm

There is a mass of ruins
Great deal of damage is done
Scenes of horror and pain
The storm before the calm

Bridges shatter - fractured roads -
intense nightmare - running slow

Till The Moment Of Glow And Glory(Instrumental)(Lyrics adapted from the text by Georg Trakl)

Blind lament in the wind, moony winter days,
Childhood, quietly the steps fade near black hedge,
Long evening bells,
Quietly the white night approaches

Transforms pain and worriment into purple dreams
Of stony living,
So that the thorny sting will never leave the rotting body.

Deep in slumber, the anxious soul heaves a sigh,

Deep the wind in broken trees,
And the lamenting figure
Of the mother staggers through the lonely forest

Of this speechless grief; nights
Filled with tears, fiery angels.
Silvery a childlike skeleton smashes on bleak wall.(Instrumental)The first thing I saw...
Was a shadow of an evil sight
That was not all...
There was a growl which gave me a fright

Should I scream and call...
But what for, no ones out in the night
I would not fall...
Through my faith, I chose to fight

My choice was wrong...
Satan's power was stronger than mine
Demons strapped me down...
They slashed and tore my guts to drink with wine

Evil prophecies foretold
The day shall come, escape for none

Doomed to Death and Damned in Hell
Nothing left for me to tell
Doomed to Death and Damned in Hell

Now i burn in Hell
There's no escape, doomed for good
No more to tell...
This is the end, it's understoodDo not read between the lines 
And they'll tell you where to go 
Do not plant the seeds so blindly 
Cause they'll show you what to grow 

And if you answer to the gods 
They will make you all their own 
On your limbs the strings are winding 
Knotted and so weighed down 

Take hold of the molecules 
And lay beside celestial virgins 
Reflecting in the rays of light 
Not for long, the clock will linger 
So If you look before you step 
There's no hole to stumble down 
Because the lines are bending 

But what was left when all was taken? 
The empty sky within our reach 
The world and all its fascination 
All composed of long-gone dead stars 

Memory machine will stray 
Praising such pristine ways 
If they knew predestination 
All these years was just a farce 
To be defined by what we wear 
If that's so then find me naked 
For the cause of ancient fear 

Condemned, oh I wondered there 
Never hear the sound and make me hollow 
And truth at last, nobody would find me there 
Would you remember on the way back? 
Can you feel the instigation? 

One with all the ever-ending waves but spread across the surface 
Connected through the cells and dust that waded in a stellar ocean 
Above the starbed I saw it clearly 
Flashing toward the Earth 

I saw a vision of the past, of the present, and the future 
An odd projection of reality 
But what could ever possibly be worth 
About 14 millions years of vengeance? 

If all known perspective is just an illusion 
And if they curse themselves in vain 
Where will all the lost souls go 
When they see they made their own god? 

Lost inbound and close to danger 
If there was nothing to believe 
Then death would be not become a source of power 
You will decompose back from whence you came 

True love don't last 
I would tell you but nobody knows me like that 

There was a place where I called home, where it was nothing short of bizarre 
And they will never know just anything more than what they are 
Justified all of the reasons why and so alone in all the world 
Are they leaving nothing behind 

There are the victims of the world that let their faith be taken in 
As if it was resting on the shoulders of the ones who dream alone 
I am the king of falling down and I am finally learning now 
That there's a difference between finding recourse and making amends 

And everyone was there sinking in the sea 
Just I had seen a million times before in this dream 
I am the king of falling down, and I am slowly learning now 
That you were the only thing that made me believe in human beings 

True love don't last 
I would tell you but nobody knows 

Dreamt in silent design 
Weeping willows, growing networks of despair 
Once slaves of our own creation 
I saw the universe inside the bleak of man and there he wondered 
What would follow the end of his life? 
Would the world forget his passage? 
He will be washed from timeNo one is good in the eyes of almighty God
Creation inherit the seed which be the cause of death
Since the first man's fall, we all suffered the separation
No matter what norm and laws we create, we shall not be saved by them

Nobody but God himself who change the fate of human being
Far beyond the glimpse of dreams and longingness of these earthly wisdoms

Living by a faith in the son who was born as flesh and blood
He took over the natural consequences
Which was directed to us
The death and resurrection of Christ had paid the cost of damnation 
Escaping the eternal suffering, reconciliation between God and mankindBacon double cheeseburger pizza pops

In this world you don't know,
if you are gonna live or die
today or tomorrow that's uncertain
Decisions have become
uncertainty and darkness ;
people are blinded by war and by
a wish of fighting

[Chorus:]
Against brothers causing huge damages
people have become war machines,
machines that don't know
what they do,
because theri lives
turn around a weapon.
That protects them from a senseless battle
That protects them from a senseless battle.

Brother killing brother, thinking of his word as
a rule thinking of defending
what belong to him,

[Chorus:]
But poisoned by te rich ones
who only want power,
people who never care
Neither world peace nor well being,
but just thinking of competition
to show who's powerful in this
hazard game where the blameless die
Trying to survive.Reagent

Returned from Austria with knowledge of regeneration. A mentor dead from causes unknown..
The prize medical student arguing the ideas of life, time and death. Labeled as a witless kook.

Dan Cain.. Mad doctors roomate..
Megan Halsey.. Roomate's fiance
Herbert West.. Giver of Life!

The reagent must be perfected. The dead are not happy to be waken from their eternal sleep
Experiments must be performed.. Subjects must be found and the living must be re-animated!

It all began with his roomates very dead cat..
Upon being issued with reagent kitty gets cranky
And tries clawing out the good doctors eyes
Dan returns home to help subdue his fatal feline

To the morgue they venture
In search of a fresh corpse
The unhappy zombie rampages
Killing the rather unhappy Dean

Things have gone terribly wrong.. Carl Hills jealousy shall be his undoing
With Carls head living head in a pan.. Megan has been kidnapped by the madhead

A host of corpses to inject with the glowing green life serum
Dr. West and Dan must destroy the living dead to get her back
In the ensuing orgy of gore megan is left mortally wounded
Dan has lost his rational mind.. Megan must be re-animated

Returned from Austria with an unsettling knowledge. Terrible happenings at a medical university
Experiments have been performed. Dead have found life and the living have found nothing but death..Gravity curving a region of space-time 
Event horizon, point of no return 
Thermodynamic, quantum field theory 
Emitting electromagnetic radiation 

The infinitesimal flow of time 
Wraps around my neck like a noose 
As it pulls tight I feel my soul collapse 
Into a single point, a black hole in space 

Inferring presence through interaction 
With other matter and radiation 
Growing and merging with my brethren 
Become super massive, form galaxies 

The quintessential void of space 
Caresses my soul like a vice 
Caught inside its grip all I am is crushed 
Into a single point, a moment in time 

You can't escape the pull 
Black Hole(Instrumental)There is a wasteland where time seems to stand still
No voice, no sound, only shadows
I walk through its hills, searching for no one
The city is a ghost, better hiding or you'll be lost

Someone whispers in my ears is it real or just a dream?
I don't want to know, I feel trapped, lord please pray for my soul
There's a way to escape from these streets.
I will leave this desolation to chase my dreams
But whenever I touch the air I feel some breath, please save me...

Mist and shadows all around,
The silence is screaming in my mind
We've lost our faith and destroyed our reality
A ghost city it's what remains
No man, I miss all my friends
No safety just loneliness

I will find where people still hope
Cause I see ghosts along my lonely way
But no fears will stop me or our will to live
I will find you

Crouching figures in the mist
Speak to me from their confusion
They bring me down to the graves
Living me in haze

Mist and shadows all around,
The silence is screaming in my mind
We've lost our faith and destroyed our reality
A ghost city it's what remains
No man, I miss all my friends
No safety in a ghost cityThe incorporeal shadows rest my piety 
 Facing the mercy of bitterness 

 Push the pieces of bitter meat escaping 
 When I no longer speak 

 Miss the senses granted by the authority 
 And perpetuate them as part of your sadness 

 You will be wretched drops sewn by seven needles 

 You will be wretched beings bred by anyoneThe hero's statue drips with stones
Parched dried up like his bones

The tragic laurel goes
To the temples
As their doors come to a close

The lava blows
Vesuvius Blushes
Underneath his clothes

The tragic laurel goes
With the torso
Locked in contrappasto pose

The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes(Instrumental)Carlos can eat a ton of burritos
Carlos, yeah

I, Carlos will bring you a burrito
I, Carlos will bring you a burrito, yeah!

Tacos for everybody!(Instrumental)with gods by my side 
i ride into war 
take the name 
and fight the fight 

warriors on the fields of battle 
fighting for the glory juulen 

glory and honor 
surround the fight 
bodies of heretics 
fly by the thousandsFeel alone,
Slugbait, love, hate,
Slugbait, without it,
Just a dream,
Slugbait,
Wrong,
Slugbait, love, hateA bloodied rostrum and missing fins, teeth marks raked from gill to grin. 
From far away, it's easily seen, the ordeal through which I had been 

Specific gravity, taken it's toll, fateful events left their holes 
Teeth replaced from ones behind, nictating membranes hide swollen eyes 

Uncanny, I sailed straight to thee, in tonic immobility 
One drop in a million 

Spiteful seas and sharper shores, I'd suffer all again 
And navigate with magnetic pores, a thousand chance occurrences 
Uncanny, I sailed straight to thee, in tonic immobility 
One drop in a million 

To migrate is to suffer 
Like fleeting friends, thermoclines come and go 
A family asunder, I cheers the deserters, 

An unfathomable reward, now breaths and growsI come, and stand at every door
This heart is always at it's end

Master, For you I'm so weak
Heartless, But my faith is strong

I come, and stand at every doorThe flames of hatred burns my soul to ash
The fury flows through my veins as my contempt increases
The embracing of gloom fills my darkened mind with wrath
My urge to hunt you as a prey fills my enchanted spirit

Never before have I felt the need to turn my vengeance against you
I summon my inner strength to strike down upon your unworthy spirit
I will prevail over your gracious body
As I enthrone myself to feed my hidden lusts

Supremacy
Supremacy

Beneath the shadows of ancient times, I seek your frightened mind
Your hypocrisy and your lies will be your sodomized end
The tearful eyes of yours shows your bleeding desire
Your fears culminate into pleasure as I reach your longing thoughts

Never before have I felt the need to turn my vengeance against you
I summon my inner strength to strike down upon your unworthy spirit
I will prevail over your gracious body
As I enthrone myself to feed my hidden lusts

Supremacy
SupremacySome say the world will end in violence, or the sea will rise and cover up the land. You said the world was never-ending. When we were young, fate was far more kind, and the sun shone higher and more brightly, and the night was never quite this black. Could we have been so wrong? Where have you been gone? How could you wait so long, only to return, and die at my feet? Now I beg the truth from strangers, on empty streets in decaying towns, but I can't forget your words. You said god was all around us, but I can't find him anywhere, and I've looked behind every tree and stone. No star in the East, to light my path; no voice in the dark; no gentle hands, guiding me back home. And I know you're here no longer, if you were ever here at all, but I feel your eyes upon me, and somehow, I swear you're hiding, behind every tree and stone, behind every tree and stone.[FAILURE IS THE SYSTEM]

What must we do to proceed?

Outbreak of misery for all in his way
to withstand the power and to live another day
Is he just human or some kind of druid?
Anti-Socialistic, wreched soul
His tale goes on for all who has told
It makes us stronger, its time to fight back
At the devils in the shadows (its laugh insane)
He opens up his eyes to this vicious scene

Extend his rotten hand
and feel all his wrath
He came across our presence
Amoung these innocent people

Bursting through the minds like thunder
steady our words, we need to act
All this wasted time, did it not seem so right?
this rage and torment, no heart, no sorrow
Its in your nature you pityful fool
Breaking me down, not opening up

giving extra courage to the dying others

religions teach methods of a survival of the holiest
you would rather be a survivor of the luckiest

however, we do desire us to survive

avoiding any factor of changeableness

we wish to design our grand destiny
a destiny which is entering into the psyche

You can't wash these stains
This snow doesn't melt away
Black dirt always grins
Under the bleak coma white

Ash covered leaves, green grey winter

Still my hands grope for flames
They touch the soul of frost
Looking for the hidden seed
The hope is grotesque and vain

Sad still life weeps for spring
Ash covered leaves, green grey winter

The blue moment in the noon
Reveals to be the last of the lights
Caress the green joy from the tree of life
This cold season will wither us allI watch your eyes in the moment of death
Hear your cries as you take your final breath
I watch your eyes - the mirror of your soul
Sinful whore under Lucifer's control

Moribund - destined to die on gods demand

Fear the scythe for you're the harvest of death
Feel the scythe ripping through your final breath
All the lies told by the slaves of god
Holy lies that defiled your virgin's blood

Moribund - destined to die on gods demand

Let the fire reach higher
To burn all sinful flesh away
All mortal desires
Extinguished by the cleansing flames

The open mind is burning at the stake
Millennia of ancient wisdom are erased
A world in chains of spiritual deceit
The earth enslaved by dogmatic false belief

Moribund - destined to die on gods demandThe fount has been poisoned and the each new stream is blacker than the one before. The place where I shall find the most distant horizon has been subverted and penetrated by a malignant divinity, the one delimited by powers of laws and principles ramifying into delta of all possibilities.

When the unwanted foetus desired to see its own image, the reflexions proliferated further in the amniotic fluids of nothingness. Lo! The first breath of the universe. The pulsating abscess of the frothing quantum (the seed of matter) becoming existence. Now the cycle is bound into a vicious circle of unsubstantiality. 

We see the spiral basis of the universe, of dark becoming light and light collapsing into darkness. The ichor from the cosmic womb deforms the web of space and through the black mouth we learn of the black words signifying the fate of macrocosm that heralds the death of all. Even of Death itself.

In sacred waters of nothingness eternal was your strife. By the quiver of spectral Acherontia's wings the reality dissolves into a seething cataclysm. Alas, the infinity loses the notion of time and begins to count again.

Through the temple-like eye of cosmic consciousness we stare at what itself stares at us across the human paradigm of inner purpose.Far out in the night sky 
Hawks programmed to feed 
Coagulated flesh awaits 
As they push for the outer realm 

Striving for singularity 
Resistance from veins 
And past glories 

Striving for singularity 
Calculation to decision 

Arrows of limestone 
Volleys carving holes 
Circuitry structuring caves 
A socket for a sage 

Trajectory locked 
Ready to return 
Runways of ice 
Melting for eons 

Reorient its sensors 
Let it utter no more 
Corrupt its servos 
prepare to occupy every transmission 

Prodded by severed strands of gold 
The sage revels in the consequences 
Dissolving the fallopian path to Hebe 
Sunburnt visions of blossoming worlds 

Violent incursions 
Into realms of the living 
Violent incursions 
Into realms of the dead 

Punctured by cyberinfrastructure 
Portal wounds open for cosmic dust 
Neuromorphic pathways beyond exascale 
Sunburnt visions imprinted on retinae 

Cosmic secrets as they graze 
Wastelands will be ours 
Implements of gnosis 
To the deckabused by you - can't stand upright
so dead tired - awake in the night
fake my world - state of confusion
waste my time - I'm forced to comply

open your eyes
see through the dust in your sight
something like truth in disguise
the door is open wide
feelings get lost in your mind
the curse of the moment remains

selfish life - only illusive
sense of sight - a man with a child's eye
instant fall away
live my life the way it's meant to be
take my soul
you fake my world and waste my time
you make me wan to die

open your eyes
see through the dust in your sight
memories they melt in your mind
the door is open wide
feelings get lost in your life
the curse of the moment remains

end the fight - stand aside - take me as I am
my hands are tied - I stake my life
to open up my eyes
get me now - make-believe
save me from the fall
you take my soul - you fake my world
and waste my time - won't leave me as I amClose the door, douse the candles,
Banish your oath and lock your mind.
Penetrate beneath the cross-crowned altar,
Ejaculate the semen for your god and father.

Which hand do you really take? Left or right?
Switching on the path of faith. Left or right?

The union of phallus and anus is celebrated.
The secrets of sexuality are discovered deep.
Lay down your ropes; wear the garb of sin instead.
Reinterpret moral words and psalms inverted.

Moaning in lust and holy treacheries.
Damnation and satisfaction!
In one way they are all broken emissaries.
Damnation and satisfaction!

Close the door, douse the candles,
Banish your oath and lock your mind.
Penetrate beneath the cross-crowned altar,
Ejaculate the semen for your god and father.

Oh god of grace, forgive them,
Close your permanent controlling eyes.
Accept your reared perversion,
Bless them all and let a new day rise.Don't talk to me about what you done
Ain't nothing has changed it all goes on
And they'll keep laughing till the end

I've seen them drive around in cars
All look the same get drunk in bars
And don't talk back we got no social rights

Oh perfect day
What more to say?
Don't need no one to tell me what I don't already know

We got no high times always flat
If you go out you don't come back
It's all so funny I can't laugh

Oh perfect day
What more to say?
Don't need no one to tell me what I don't already know

Don't talk to me about what's you done
Ain't nothing has changed it all goes on
And they'll keep laughing till the end

Oh perfect day
What more to say?
I don't need no one to tell me what I don't already knowDetailed arcs, rout individual 
Doted topography a pronounced disillusion 
Coherent area, alienation 
And they dynamics of living a lie. 

Omniscient turbines grinding 
Analytical glare of anti-glee 
Refined into asbestos 
Introduced to preempt wonder. 

Captured in this circle - composition 
Stooped by patently ulterior cares 
The hushed quiver, of a semi-life 
As the machine rolls onRemembering the day when You were crucified
Hung and nailed to the cross, a sacrifice for mankind
Your precious blood wash away the sin
More than just a hero, You are my Savior

Remembering the day when You were arose from the dead
A total victory, banish away the stain of death
Your precious love lasting eternally
More than just a hero, You are my Savior

I feel the warmth of Your love embraces me
Through the last days of imperfect life, there's a hope

Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly O Lord Jesus
Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly, giver of hope

You are the only truth, all praise and glory to You
Lord, I am waiting for Your second coming

Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly O Lord Jesus
Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly, my eternal lover
(x2)I feel the deepest emptiness
Opening my eyes
I listen to the silence
Coming from the sky
Looking around I search for someone,
But nobody says: "Get up Crazyman!"
I can not forget two unreachable stars
They shine brightly,
But I can't catch their light

It seems to me they look like
Hot Spanish night
They call me, but stop - they are
Just in my mind!
I look through the mirror
And I can not explain
If it's a movie or my fancy's game
Turbulent river with two different banks
Blue sky's purity - your tears innocence
Something intangible, helpless and weak
But something strong, independent and big
Is flying alone and looking-what for?
I think it can't live by itself anymore
I think it can't live by itself anymoreMy Life Is Rushing In Slow Motion,
All I Did, I Did It With Total Devotion
Tears Are Now Dripping From Eyes
Is It Really Time To Say Good-Bye?
Am I One Of Those,
Love Dwells Deep In Its Heart?
An Attempt, I Failed...
And Love Dwells So Far...
All Hope, For A Musical Existence, Has Gone
I Buried My Dream, Reconciliation Is Done
Life Now Slips Away, Am I Only Dreaming?
New Intentions, Other Dimensions Are Breeding
Am I One Of Those,
Love Dwells Deep In Its Heart?
An Attempt, I Failed...
And Love Dwells So Far...Blood, source of human live
Without it you will not survive 
The heart pumps it out everyday
As you live your own way
That will soon all change
'cause I think I'm insane
I'll end your life for you
There's nothing you can do

I will take your blood
And drain it all from you
Haematomania- obsession of human blood

First I'll tie you up
And hang you upside down
Then I'll slit your throat
And Let your blood flow onto me
Some I'll set aside
For the next sacrifice
Which shall be a baby
Ha ha thank God I'm Crazy

I will take your blood
And drain it all from you
Haematomania- obsession of human blood

Satan's work shall be done 
Part of my Necronomicon
The Great Old Ones shall rise
And take all human livesThe first one I found in my cellar at home
He was hanging around in his suicide dome
Next I have killed as I was in the church
I saw him pray, to his god on this way
Next was my mom, as visitor she was scum
Number four this was my dad, disembowelment in bed
Bodies over all and I am going to call my private whore
On the phone for my collection of bones
Twenty bodies, twenty souls, twenty was to die
Twenty reasons, terminate and forty eyes
Twenty times of sweet erection, twenty I take with me
Twenty hells, two hundred fingers, bad century
I am the collector, the slashing protector
Keep your mouth shut, wait for an uterine cut
For seven and eight, was the time much to late
I take them with me and will make things they'll never see
Last you can taste, maybe the blood on your face
Nine on a string, twenty bodies I sing
I need many more, I am addicted to gore
Ten was a project, I fill in oil
Boiling oil
Bitches are boring, remains are a mess
Next one broke down, as I overstretched his ass
I walk through the park, my mind was insane and dark
I saw four people in action, so I'll take for my collection
From a bag-man in trash, I'll take all of his flesh
Make a dinner for my friends, three find a poison end
Nineteen'th remain under unspeakable pain, gasping for air
But his lung was not there
Twenty bodies, twenty souls, twenty ways to die
Twenty chains and twenty hooks
Collector passed by
For nineteen people, it's too late now
Look up what you do
twenty bodies I need at home
Collector is watching youI have already seen the Black Prophecies
About the earthly demon's trap
And all it's illusions
Brothers, let us break the chains
And pee liberally on those
Who point their pigeon beaks
Within safe range of the flock
Dancing bears, be unleashed
Upon your ruthless spectators
Be free, radicals
To destroy my structures
I have already eaten the desert sandNow Random is the king of Amber. & Korvin is tired from the dissention with his brothers. Too many brothers are death: Erick, Blaze, Kain : What for :? For the right to be a king? He created his own labyrinth & exerted too much effort to do it. & now after the great struggle between Amber & Chaos he decided to go away from everybody & everything.

Devise, hurling down my speech of shrines
Recluse, riding down into the pain I claim
Guard, seeing you brace I will revoke
Immense, generous deep is all to blame

Orbit of illusion
I was to be woed
Priest that sanctified
The sermon of demise
It's a priestly lie
Laid for deathly profits
My mouthpiece
My hand
But I'm breaking up, My foot
All the old tables, My stomach

Down to the filthy muck
No hands from the sky
A spirit is dead
Mourning for your pain
Smirking signs
Praising the unholy dead
A spring of solitude

Whisper to all in the dark lanes
Crying with a frightful voice
The spontaneous bark of globe
Four fragrance of the future songs
Flying, fluttering, creeping or leaping
Towards the golden marvel(Instrumental)Sailing through the deepest sea 
An ocean of suffering 
Countless souls at the mercy 
Of impervious waters 
Past is dead 
Future's unknown 
A whish for the land come 
Carrying their anchors 
That never reach the soil 
And then the storm comes 
Cause death is freedomABYSS OF DEPRESSION

(music by Alex Pishikin; lyrics by Alex Pishikin)

cold of your hand I'm feeling
 your lifeless eyes watching in
 I see death reflection in them
 I plunge all more deeply into the abyss of depression

feel the emptiness, taste it
 emetic mass of soul pieces
 by muddy fetid stream
 comes out of me

remained alone with myself
 trying to find something bright in my life
 looking through the moments of previous relative victories
 you come to a thought that the war has been lost

and you are not killed but captured
 feel emptiness, taste it
 emetic mass of soul pieces
 by muddy fetid stream
 comes out of me

when there is no force and desire to live
 it remains to plunge all more deeply
 into the abyss of depression

when there are no hopes and feelings are atrophied
 it remains just to plunge all more deeply
 into the abyss of depression

feel emptiness, taste it
 emetic mass of soul pieces
 by muddy fetid stream
 comes out of meForget yourself, just don't respect yourself
Reject yourself, just don't respect yourself
Feel weak, you just mean nothing
Feel owned, just feel like nothing
Stand Down, show your weak
Stand down, make them smile
Don't see yourself, just see outside yourself(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Demons of the black finally got to me,
Dead to the world, a very dead soul,
Pieces scattered, can't tell which are real,
Don't know myself, I'm breaking down,

There are three in here,
Mind at constant war,
Too many losses, I'm all alone,
Who am I, what have I become,

Am I really dead or is it all fake,
What is fake anyway?,
Do I even give a fuck?,
Don't know myself, I'm breaking down....When the gates have opened and the souls have been gathered 
to be rebuilt into human flesh 
When the prince of this world has cast the angels out 
When he has rebelled 
When they have been fooled into the gloom of corruption 

Hundred million dead in the valley of hate 
With blood to the knees 
Fulfill the devious scheme and bring us child from the womb of the whore 
Delivered to the crowd that wears the mark of the beast 

When the earth is shaking and the lamb is trembling 
before our vicious lord 
When the brimstone smothers the most devout 
When the father of lies has slain the horse and smashed the sword in unholy disruption 

Hundred million dead in the valley of hate 
With blood to the knees 
Fulfill the devious scheme and bring us child from the womb of the whore 
Delivered to the crowd that wears the mark of the beast 

Behold the unfaithful 
In the holy land 
Abandoning their god 
For the bounty of pleasure 
To the lord of fear 
They swarm like bees 
Inferior and defenseless 

Behold the unfaithful 
In the holy land 
Abandoning their god 
For the bounty of pleasure 
To the lord of fear 
They swarm like bees 
Inferior and defenseless 
Like a horde of rats on the burning ship of corruption 

Hundred million dead in the valley of hate 
With blood to the knees 
Fulfill the devious scheme and bring us child from the womb of the whore 
Delivered to the crowd that wears the mark of the beast 

And every knee will bowI'd rather not wake up
There's no need to wake up
Bliss is what I got
In this blind world of my own
My own!

Survival is carnal
And that's what I seek
No reason to conquer at all

I'm driven by moment
So no one would infect my being
"Sub specie aeterni"
Not for me

Killing makes whole the essence of our time
So I have my ways to shield my carnal mind
But it takes awhile

Forms in pandemonium
Gods going berserk
Still without judgement
See my point?

Fear, senses, irrelevant graves
All time and power to face

God weakened, a soul searching form
Chaos pronounced a privilege

Outside all matters
Options not given
Some folklore sacrifice
Without hornsWeary lights in my soul, they vanish one by one
I wait for your flame, the final blaze
Summon the cradle for nightmares and worms
In the gleam of flames reveal yourself

The fire...

The brightest flame is not red, it glows in all white
Black shadows getting darker - The hidden procreation
In the boiling ocean without any drops
In the boat of iron, in the torturing casket

I travel down...down...down...
Against my fate
Against the last fire
Against the dance...
...of light and shadow...
...of life and death...
...of my Master...
...of my Master...Slaved By The Light"

I am a man, a casualty of an terribly accident 
I remember as I hover over my body
And I'm sorry for this deformed man
Until then I realise, that in fact it's Me !

They want Me to save, but I need nothing
Don't hear Me ? As I exist not at all, I'm DEAD ...

Suddenly I enter a dark and long tunnel
At the end is a light and some strange being
I don't know if is it a man or a woman
We walk all my life from the beginning to the End !

Oh ... What all evil I'm doing 
To my nearness and so foes
Now I feel this cruelty self on my skin
Again I surviving all what have I do to another's
At the end of all, the light being turn to me.

... And with tender voice she says :

You must return, the time is not yet come for you,
This beauty around us is here to the eternity 
And you be with its you are a another man, 
You have a open mind, the reality takes you 
Else so return in your body and live fully to the End !

Vanished is all their hope, but I (Instrumental)(Instrumental)Merry Fucking Christmas 
Ho Ho Ho I hope You've been good children this year 
Santa has a big surprise for you 
Tossing back and forth cannot get to sleep 
Falling into Christmas, the hill is slick and steep 
Got to get some gifts got to get them quick 
'Cause if you don't participate they'll call you 'selfish prick!' 
Jingle Bells straight from hell, Santa Claus is dead 
Walmarts's filled with bodies that have lost their bloody heads 
Corporations make a killing sucking wallets dry 
Christmas is a cruel joke that makes poor people cry. 
Stuck in traffic jams cursing at the snow 
'Used to have a savings but where did it go? 
Into corporate slush funds to boost economies 
Every year this season puts the workers on their knees! 
Jingle Bells strait from hell, Santa Claus is dead 
Walmart's filled with bodies that have lost their bloody heads 
Corporations make a killing sucking wallets dry 
Christmas is a cruel joke that makes poor people cryGrandma got dismembered by a zombie coming home from work on Christmas nightSomething 'bout a senior serving French fries 
Makes the Christmas season not seem right. 
She don't make much at McDonalds 
Her hours only add to thirty nine 
If she did her Christmas shopping, she'd be out on the corner holding a sign 
Silver Bells go to hell 'cannot pay our bills 
All these useless gifts will end up in a landfill 
Light the Christmas tree on fire, watch the branches burn 
With any luck we'll wipe out all our debts next tax returnI don't know why so many people stare at me
like if i, i was an alien, coming from outer space
staring but also laughing, like if i was a clown enough ridiculous
to be laugh at, even when it's day off
Are you nothing to do?
You little peace of shit?
I ain't know you!
I ain't look at you this way!
I guess you are just fucking boring
Or I'm just to weird for this fucking world!
And you, silly bitch, better have a look in
the mirror before criticize other people!
Look at yourself at home, you might have funny days!
Your face seems to be the same as an evil, yeah!
I can see that, behind your skin, you are a big bag full of shit!
And you, fucking little boy, how dare you look at me this way?
I guess you never fuck a girl before,
and i also guess all of you sperm will fly away
when a slut will just show you her hairy pussy
Faget!
So please, leave me alone!
All alone, that's what i want to be for now.
Oh! One more word...
You listen to that shity song, if you act like this in the real life,
believe me, better run away if you see me
I HATE YOU! Is that clear?
I HATE YOU! Is that clear?Silent Night

Walking in the woods
There I feel the darkness Like how I feel
In the rain of steel
I felt so empty as I've never felt

Where was the end that I have never seen?
As if I just awaked in the middle of a dream
The story without an end
Captured my soul into another land

This is how I live my life
And I know my ways
Don't touch my soul
You have caused enough pain

Hear the leafs falling from the trees
Now the boughs are empty as my hart
Hear the whispering noises
As if they have something to say

Just let the soul going his way
Just let the soul going his way
Violation by mind imagination

Yet the feelings become hate
And I'll make an end of the silent that prevails
Through my ambition of violence
Who were in the laid of dark emotions

Where was the end that I have never seen?
As if I just awaked in the middle of a dream
The story without an end
Captured my soul into another land

Emotions like moments of malice and pain
It's torturing my mind that's going insane
Till I can accept the fact that happened
So I can finish my story, which will be over when I am death(Instrumental)Alone on the riverbank
The water cool and clean and swift
Black waters and rapid current
A tenuous communion I cannot name
I have to believe that pain is the teacher
Unable to envision even the barest physical certainties
of the death of myself or those close to me
Living with constant pain
Sharp and thin like a needle
The haze of the forest in early November
An echo from the ageless hills
The quiet country of the past
where weeping is hushed and marches are ended
An apparition in the woodlands at dusk
Touching in thin rooms at dawn's low light
Imprisoned in the subjectivity of my memory
What else can there be?
Drunkenness and some vague lonely nostalgia
for something dead long before my birth
I have to believe that pain is the teacher(Instrumental)I fall down, can't stand up,
I stay down, won't stand up, I humanize everything,
everything is me.(Instrumental)You're free from your womb now
but this maternity ward is a feeding ground
don't look back for ages
your mother's toothy smile can smell you for miles

You too will eat your young
you too will eat your young
consume all that crosses your path
each morsel may be your last
never cling like the remora
to those you spawned you in the past

You too will eat your young
when there's only enough for one
in times of need this must be done
from womb to gut it has begun

Eat your young

The songs of giants lure you
will you follow
their scents of gluttony tempt you
will you follow

Energy is precious and journey long
feed now and breed again
the birth is food
now feed on

Tides pull and convince
their direction is the best
waves hide all that lies
well beyond their crest

You too will eat your young
from womb to gut it has begun
eat your youngAs a young boy he was taken far from home 
Trained with severity to serve a sultan's throne 
With deeds of cruelty he earned an evil fame 
Vlad the Impaler was his name 

When Vlad retired from war he ruled in his own land 
To keep the peace he served the sultan's iron hand 
One fateful day the price of peace had grown too high 
The sultan's armies had to die 

A demon told him that his father was the Devil 
Who had full control of all the powers of the night 
Renouncing faith, he unleashed his inner demon 
The sultan's armies were annihilated by the Dragon's evil might 

Son of the Devil, the Dragon feeds on blood 
Son of the Devil, the Vampire feeds on blood 

The legends speak of secret societies 
Who rule the earth with an all seeing eye 
Vlad Dracul selects his victims carefully 
When you outlive your usefulness, your day is drawing nigh

Its a curse, its a curse
and by day its getting worse
Im living in the shadow of a monster
Its a Curse! Its a Curse!
And by day its getting worse
Im living in the shadow of the monster
Like a bird, without wings
Im a puppet on a string
Im Living in the Shadow of the Monster in Me! In Me!
Oooh In Me!Devouring your so delicious flesh
it's my favourite, your tasteless flesh

Shed your skin like snake that you are
Shed your skin to see what you are
Skin yourself alive
Obscure mortal flesh

Devouring your so delicious flesh
my favourite, your tasteless flesh

Shed your skin like snake that you are
Shed your skin to see what you are
Skin yourself alive
Obscure mortal flesh

Obscure mortal flesh...
Flesh.
Flesh.
Flesh.
Flesh.
Skin yourself aliveMaster of mind keep me away from the line
Master of mind keep me away from the crime
I follow your signs when I fear that I have to decide

He takes my hand `teaching me how to pretend
Always a friend trust in his words till the end
Lead me to heaven I`ll do what you want me to do

Fear in my head - dust in my eys
I feel your intention in times of the night
It`s the strenght that can force to obey
Before I rely on the power you have
I`ll be gone

Play with my soul - always inside
Defy my religion - a slave to the mind
It`s the fear of the use of your might
But how can offer resistance to you in my head ?Chaos feeds a bliss in me
Pleasure falsified
Self destructive intimacy

Craving digs my grave in lies
No one hears the inner cries

Chaos now presides in me
Evil archetype
Self inflicted hypocrisy

Fear, I meet, between the lines
Love, through pain, I try to find

Enter the chaos in motion
Repulsive, are, my emotions

In hell, I descend
As my coma rises
The mask of joy,
With shame, I wear
As I sink in demiseSo big and beautiful
But thru my eyes a pile of filth
Why should I
Pay for nothing I use
I did not ask for it to be built

Never will I put money in the
Collector's plate
As I see it we don't need this
House of greed

I refuse to pay for nothing I use
But still it steals from what I earn
It steals from you maybe you don't know it yet
Like a thief it takes to survive

Never will I put money in the
Collector's plate
As I see it we don't need this
House of greed

With time more people with know
With fire they will defend themselves

Burn the church down
Burn it down

Fire devours the church like nothing
Stay away from me or fire I will bring

Feel free to hate me but this is what I think
Nothing that you say will ever change me

Burn the church down
Burn it down

So big and beautiful
But thru my eyes a pile of filth
Why should I
Pay for nothing I use
I did not ask for it to be built

Never will I put money in the
Collector's plate
As I see it we don't need this
House of greed(Instrumental)Off of Highway Five 
I won't tell you the exit 
Is a filthy rest stop 
Men are having sex at 
They leave condoms on the ground 
For innocent dogs to eat 
They leave syringes in the grass 
For stepping on with bare feet 

Kids from my home town 
Busted for petty stealing 
Find themselves sentenced 
To rest stop cleaning 

I don't want to be the kettle 
That called the pot black 
But this rehabilitation scheme 
Is the wrong attack 
Kids need role models 
Like the Four Freshmen or Mercyful Fate. 
Punish them with rest stop cleaning 
And beware the monsters you create 

Kids from my home town 
Punished by their very birth 
Let them work fast food jobs 
Let them prove their worth.Drakenmuil wijst vooruit
ijzer gloeit als vuur
Gieren volgen in het zog
Zoute wind bijt de huid

Klievend door de baren
Gesel van het grote nat
Heerser van de gouden zee
Demoon met gouden haren(Instrumental)Blood on the floor 
I hate you so much 
Like I adore the way you suffer 
I will not stop until I put this knife in you 
I will not be satisfied until your life is through 
Waiting for the perfect time 
To kiss your sorry ass goodbye 
And some might say this was our time to finish 
And some might say memories in your mind diminished us all 
Inside the prisons we hide 
Behind the walls built of lies 
Rattle the cage of thirteen eyes 
Inside the prisons we hide 
Behind the walls built of lies 
Rattle the cage of thirteen eyes 
Reused abused and denied 
Chemical thirteen 
Pump it into my veins 
Hope it takes away my pain 
Chemical thirteen 
You better hope it destroys my brain 
Blood on the floor 
I hate you so much 
Like I adore the way you suffer 
The perfect view, of all we are 
The blissful youth 
Torn apart 
They're bending your minds 
Oh look what is this open up 
Your third eye cyst 
You're seeing things you know exist 
Open up the knowledge exists 
Creature born of disguise 
Fill your head with lies 
Creeping over your throne 
Threw you out of your home 
They've come to drink your blood 
And send your kids to war 
They have destroyed your family 
And now they question your own 
sanity!i could have just fallen there, and closed my eyes.
become the earth.
it was something else, that let this diseased old heart, keep its rhythm.
the stories, that sagged the air.
the secrets, that kept them there.
their weight bent the ground.

"you will cower, or you will listen.
you will die, or surely live forever."little lady lillit sasn't very nice
she would torture small things all her little life
poke them tease them that is what she'd do
little lady lillit evil through and through

one day she was walking to her favorite haunt
skip and stomping on her evil jaunt
hacking picking flora as she ran
this was part of lillit's evil little plan

pick them up and squeeze them good this is what she'd do
little things flee from her grasp or it was their ass!
pick them up and squeeze them good this is what she'd do
little things flee from her grasp or it was their ass!

destroy and conquer was her royal quest
steal and plunder is what she did best
wreck and crumble this is what she'd do
little lady lillit evil through and through

try and change her ways and you will surely fail
she will turn around and pull your little tail
punch and kick you 'til you start to bleed
she would cut your guts out then she'd start to feed

pick them up and squeeze them good this is what she'd do
little things flee from her grasp or it was their ass!
pick them up and squeeze them good this is what she'd do
little things flee from her grasp or it was their ass!These are the sounds the vacuum made when it pulped my baby and sucked it out. 
These are the noises that I made when I watched it die on the ultrasound. 

"Well I had one spill out on the dirty floor of a bathroom at summer camp." 
"Well I can't have one anymore cause I purged too much while in rehab." 
"Well one of my patients died on the table, I'm fighting depression and about to lose." 
"Well I hear voices, twitch and grind my toes to dust inside my shoes." 

GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP if you want an A! 
Your death in the family can't beat my grade. 
GIVE IT UP UP UP if you want to pass! 
You're a middle class kid with a middle class past

BLACK MIRRORS OF FEAR(Instrumental)Through the waking darkness
In the middle of the woods
Was raised a little girl
And all her childhood

Lost in the dark woods
Beneath the roots of an old oak
Deep in the ground
She placed the sacred book
Sworn to its magic
She walks this earth
Bound to its symbols
She swore to raise the dead!!!


She wa just a little girl, merely a child of seven
While playing in the woods she found a sacred book
Charmed by its covers and mystique allure
She swore that one day she'll be worthy of it

Lost in the dark woods
Beneath the roots of an old oak
Deep in the ground
She placed the sacred book
Sworn to its magic
She walks this earth
Bound to its symbols
She swore to raise the dead!!!


Ten years later she runs towards the oak
And she starts digging desperately  to regain the book
She draws a circle of blood from her own veins
She starts enchanting the anticosmic rites:

Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas!

The grounds begin their trembling strikes
As the graves crack open
The living dead rise towards the skies
As she undresses of her burial gown
She walks this earth as their queen
And by death she'll live forever
Queen of the dead, the damned she commends
She breaths fire on humanity
The skies rain fire at her command
And trees die at her gaze
Riverz of water turn to blood
As a rezult of her rage.

Lost in the dark woods
Beneath the roots of an old oak
Deep in the ground
She placed the sacred book
Sworn to its magic
She walks this earth
Bound to its symbols
She swore to raise the dead!!!All my fears, looking where to hide
All my fears, buried deep inside
Easy for you, your skin's so tough it's hard
Easy for you, you only see what you want
Angel by your side
Easy for you, How could you be so weak
Easy for you, Everything looks just fine
Angel by your side
All my fears, looking where to hide
All my fears, they'll get in you in time
Angel by your side, Angel by your sideExistence of feelings
Is like a simple sorrow
To feel the existence
We desire the fruit of the holy
Millions of human souls
Deluded by a mysterious game
On rainy days are on their own
And shout out sad thoughts
In gardens of pain
We spend our lives
Every moment there
Is joy and madness
In the chaos of thoughts
We look over our dreams
These are the gardens of pain
Places of nonentity

Deep penetration
Intensive feelings
A bloody stump
Our worthless world
A mine of excrements
Experiments of life
In the gardens of pain
I cut God's throat

Sweet suffering
Welcome to my world
Sweet suffering
Is the ecstasy of feeling

My dream
Is not
My dream
Is not - realized

I see a splendid place
I can see the sweet time of existence
No - I am not there
This island without forgiveness

I can only see liars
I can see sick people
They said so much
To destroy my world
These are liarsIn this world we are animals in a cage
Trapped inside our self indulgence-rage
In this inside out that we label whole
We live with closed eyes, under control

Sincere at this stage
Infested by bacteriophage

When the innocent's imprisoned and the guilty's being praised
It conveys the ineptitude of the almighty human race
(Billions of witnesses applaud)

Selected leaders break down barriers by building walls
Yet the elected recede when those are about to fall
(Appeal for peace on their lips)
And bloody fingertips

We have had all the chances
We have had all the chances
In this world
We build yet we destroy
We ruin and we fall
We study yet we seem to never learn

We seem to never learn
Which marks the final turn
Of this cold war

The ice is melting
And oceans
Oceans flood the banks
And dusty deserts
Spread across
Spread across continents

We have had all the chances
We have had all the chances
In this world
We build yet we destroy
We ruin and we fall
We study yet we seem to never
Seem no never learnA raindrop, a grain of sand, and fossils leading us to the due date of man
the arrival out of nowhere, behold the first deed of humanity

in the five thousand years of civilization, mankind's
noble achievements reveal a divine spark
but there is a dark side of man's soul
that has festered since Cain slew his brother (the first act of hatred)
and here at the end of his world the monumental journey is ending

for the gentle race that shared the planet for nearly two million years
rooted in their own pre-memorial past they could
survive the violent future
the man apes are known only for their fossil remains
they were the first of many species pushed into oblivion

the longing to peace and the deep desire to immortality
is inherent to the grief and nostalgia to the unknown
fear is engraved into the human consciousness in the
search to find the truth of all historical facts

ain't we mislead then by thoughts of a mystery
ain't we mislead then that nations can disappear

ain't we mislead then knowledge of existence forever will be
while the outside world is anxious waiting
when we see that civilization is older than we assume
and the level of technology is hard to explain

ain't we mislead then by thoughts of a mystery
ain't we misled then that nations can disappear

man conquer your ambitions and appreciate the beauties of life
so that no more distinction of god and bad is needed

questions, questions, darken my clear vision
suicidal desecration of my inner strength

explore your ambitions or accept the beauties of death
so that no more distinction of god and bad is neededBeyond the mental image of a man
lies a blueprint made by God.

I am standing here recalling to
all the roads we have passed through:
Always hard to understand,
always hard to comprehend.

Yet it's always easy to believe
we are not here for no reason.
So many mistakes and failures,
so many elements of imperfection
formed by our sense of free will.

Causing sadness that never disappear
when life has broken into pieces,
we realize everything has gone so wrong.

Beyond man's own nervous breakdown
lies a blueprint made by God.
And here I am standing on a line
between reconstruction and destruction...And I face my own real self,
broken in an open world.
My heart beats a groove of grief,
bleeding to God in a path of pain.

Rhythms of anguish and desolation
move me into mournful consciousness.
While I still believe in a better tomorrow,
anxiety is on its way to consume.

And I face my own real self,
wounded in an open world.
My eyes stare into one black hole,
seeing stationary state of affairs.
A tragic life with unused obsessions
forming a torrential malevolence.

While I'm still heading towards a light ahead,
apprehension is on its way to devour.
But I am grateful knowing that I'm alive,
and that I'm grateful to be here...I Welcome You My Audience

Call Me A Wimp, Call Me What You Want
Call Me, Just Call MeI hate this world where I was born
I loathe the knowledge pretention
The ethics and virtue mankind defends

The hypocrisy of human venture where
Altruism is pride on even when
Greed and selffishness are always used
Citizen full of your own importance
Leeches sucking up money and power
I'm fed up with you !
You shall die !
My fury is aimed at those who talk
About love and claim to feel it
This world is unable
To love anything

Blind again and again with its egoncentricity
Humans sink into the sea of vile madness

As fast as it can, as fast as it wants
Lost between life and death
The only two realities of existence
Mankind has made its choice
Live in a rotten world, satisfy their greed
Die forgotten of all, without a grave
Too late for you, you're convict(ed) !(Instrumental)When you leave, please take this guilt from me 
I fear being too weak to endure 
Blind to life beyond 
Without a confidant there's only ruins 
Here comes a repeat of youth 
Signalled with each fracture 
in the world crafted around me - 
A lonely Isle, isolated. 
Burden of limitation forgotten, 
Heading towards the ocean. 
A deluge washing over, each wave thrashing 
Once at the crest the decline will follow. 
Maybe a wave will bring me gently back to shore.I am the Alpha and the Omega - Who is and who was  - And who is to come - The Almighty - I am the first and the last - And the Living one - I was dead, and behold, I am alive - Forevermore. - If I die - I'll reborn - In a vault - I'm a clone. - Two thousand years - After the Armageddon - Silence and screams - Howls and silence. - The cult of war - No more religions - No more politicians - Settlements and debris. - Two thousand years ago - The sun became black - The moon became as blood - The stars fell to the Earth - Theatre of Pain - Pawns die in the Sky - Marionettes trapped inside bunkers - The end of Mayan Long Count.  - We fought the invaders -From other dimensions - And survived to the asteroids - Form the deep space - We fought the Mark - And now we are free - Free to fight again - For a senseless freedom -Trapped in a nightmare - Without end. - I am the Alpha and the Omega - Who was and who is not - And who will never come - Dead flesh - I am the first and the last - And the dead one - I was alive, and behold, I am dead - Forevermore. - Supernovae - Black Hole - Tomorrow - Never comes.Look out gringo!

It's harvest time!
Harvest time!Your sanctimony sickens me
You lie to our faces and still think we believe
As the hammer destroys the cross
The fish falls prey to the raven
Arid is being torn apart

Our strength will be your downfall
Our swords will shatter your
Your faith has failed
We'll stay true to our gods

The way we head is against the stream
Of the weak minded sheep
Slaughter the lamb of your god

Grab your swords and take your shields
We will prevail-we will bestride
Now our time has come to fight
In armour we ride-side by side
Together we stand united as one
In wotan we trust-he is our guide
We turn this place into hell

To redesign our future needs

Entrance to a stage of balance

To survive the miserable world
Communicate omni-verbally
Gathers hope and facility
Let the spirit prays what we long
To redesign our destiny
Beyond our frail elements of conscious
There is a multi-dimensional capacity
Creating strong synergy of wish and reality
A drive to idealize values and qualityThe world is sick from terror.
Oppressed people from totalitarian states.
Minorities inside democratic systems
are depressed still.
Fighting among nations for a small piece
of land and domination there.
A man kills a man, brother his brother,
friend his friend, dad his son.
The assassin kills all including himself.
The hi-jacking of aircraft, suicidal attacks
on the streets and bombs
inside the schools and on buses.

Global terrorization
Heroes in masks
Global terrorization

How many victims will die,
on the streets today?
Fanatic religions and their endless wars
about a God.
Their members detonate explesives around
their own chest among people in the street.

Is God a terrorist too?
Can he stop the madness?
And holy wars and terror?
...And innocents die...die
...And their gods lie....lieIn the arts of war
Perfection is law,
Mercy is a mistake
No one you can trust.

Always watch your back,
Someone could betray
There are not allies
Everything is fake.

[CORO]

No matter how powerful
You think you are,
War is a gamble
Everything is fake.
No matter how powerful
You think you are,
War is a gamble
Everything is fake.

Tonight you can sleep
Lost in golden dreams,
You should rest and pray
You don't know the end

Soon you'll be enjoying
The glory of peace,
Better think that way
Fearless you must be.

[CORO]

No matter how powerful
You think you are,
War is a gamble
Everything is fake.
No matter how powerful
You think you are,
War is a gamble
Everything is fake.

...don't try to understand.

[SOLO]Where am I? Where are you?
Have I been here before?

It's spinning so fast now
I can't keep up no more

Life will kill you
And there's no one
You can call for professional help

I ponder and I wonder
What if it ends right here

Slipping into a neurosis
As I try to cope with fear

I need to believe in
That soul and karma jive

Can't help it, but it seems like
No one gets you alive

Life will kill you
And there's no one
You can call for professional help

Sure, the meaning of it all
Is a mayor nut to crack

But you promised, reassured me
I want my money back

Life will kill you
And there's no one
You can call for professional helpCast down-in the judgement of worms-i die-to this dust return : feast upon my flesh-whores liars worms all-fallen seed of dust-remain : the cursed figures crawled fourth from ruin to judgement-in shame they wander endlessly the desolation-horizons of pain-rabid incest-lay stone upon stone upon stone upon stone : beneath their many dark eyes-fornicating appendages-clutched icons- lay stones unto plague-the blessing of famine-to live endlessly in filth-a temple to none but man himself : and as i was lead towards death-i saw in their eyes a fear-fear of themselves-calmed in witness of death : into the wastes return-to feast and spawn amongst their own-the worm of man shall know divinity as he knows himself.She left me here in this infinite forest
The shadows they're all I see, can't find the way out
I may as well go in circles here obsessed by her dark riddle

I hear the wolves are gathering around me
Their eyes are blind but a hidden inner light guides their way
And though their teeth are weak I know I cannot fight them

Now the silent hunt is on and I'm alone
And my limbs they feel so worn

I see her again she's lying among dead bodies
Rotten fruit on her table swarming with maggots and flies
And there beside a sacrificial knife, it's my connectionOn other side of town the cultists make a final push into the catacombs beneath Monture Noire cemetery, with predictable results... 

Off With Their Heads 

Cremator was burning, Fermentor was losing his shit 
My body was ravaged by shrapnel, Dissector was popping a zit 
Our only escape to retreat underground 
Coughing up blood as we fled 
The cultists were gathered like rats at the entrance 
Goose-stepping full-steam ahead 
(as they said) 

"Off with their heads!" 
"Brothers of Ghoul: steel yourselves for the fight! 
If it's Heavenly entrance they're after 
We will make damn sure that they get there tonight." 
Viciously hacking with jagged-edged blades 
Dissector laughed as they bled 
Cremator burnt off their lips and their ears 
Fermentor was heard to have said, 
"Off with their heads, hahahah!!!" 

Solo Digestor 

Writhing and moaning, puddles of red 
Slitting their throats to ensure they were dead 
Into the torchlight, a vision of dread 
Cold iron lungs bellowed "Off with their heads!" 

Off with their heads!Scrounging off our valued time
striving for the life that could be mine
never to depict your wrong doing, the time has come to fight this scourge
you are an infection to our eyes
break down the fortress, smash the glass
to lead the way to victory,
fire burns all you belong to

scavengers, decripet beings
these streets grow old and pale
colour sucked from our nation
pride and glory passed away

raping our lives resources
sickened the streets like the plague
leech of our land, our veins
we watch this sick display

Our fathers broke back days
to feed our hopes and dreams
resume their role tomorrow
to see our future fail

Standing at this modern forefront
we watch you multply
rebel, we must, against the sickness
as you bleed this country dry

Laugh as we grind our knuckles 
against the systems gears
extend your hand for more
well hand you blod and tears

is their no rest for the wicked? 
the wicked are not weak
trying to earn for a dishonest days work
are we to harsh? the answer is no
try this abroad, were will we go?
what price will be left for you 
at the end of the line
Like the product of Satan
you search for the weak
dance with the bastard 
and sing his song

True, inside my every breath.

A lute can be heard,
Whilst emotions are stirred,
Fragment rose lost in love,
In walled gardens above.

Inside, the summer breeze.

The Day a woken at last,
It was destined not chance.

All beholden and wonder
Into harmony flow,
Within loneliness grow,
Drift laiden the landscape
Into forests so true
Into forests so true(Instrumental)Commandant Dobrunkum struts and preens in his headquarters high above the city as he watches the bedraggled slave force hang the Omicron Bomb from the iron hand of his gargantuan effigy. He is the master of all he surveys, and his...

VII. WORD IS LAW

In Creepsylvania, I drafted this piece of paper
That denotes that I'm its ruler for life
You gotta a problem? Well, I hope that you're a bottom
'Cause you're gonna get put to the knife
I'm leather-clad, motherfucker, super-bad
You see me coming, better bow down
The severed head of Kreeg now issues orders from me
To all the Cannibals that hung around  

HAIL CREEPSYLVANIA
Hail me!
Tremble with awe
Because my Word Is Law

I am the bomb, I've got the bomb, and with aplomb
Over the comms my voice addresses you fools
I'm not afraid of any voodoo, any mutants
Any peasants, or protesters, or Ghouls
I've got the soldiers, got the power, got the odor
Of the modern Creepsylvanian man
If they step to Dobrunkum then you know I'm gonna punk 'em
With my nightstick in the back of the van

HAIL CREEPSYLVANIA
Hail me!
Tremble with awe
Because my Word Is Law

Because my Word Is Law

Because my Word Is Law- The Zonei and their Temples - 7:77

Serpents of the deep ascended upon the thrones of kia with thoughts not of 
ceremony, but thoughts of hostile intent and idea. And the Zonei did flee this 
realm in cause of fear for many would be slain by sorcery of the ancient ones 
by lead of the ancient serpent called by Cthulhu. Many centuries have passed 
since that time of destruction. The Ancient ones have returned to their eternal
slumber. Seven great cities have been established in honor of those
And the ancient ones have made these as shrines of them
The Zonei live in fear
Slaves of ancient gods
Bound for years of years
To fill the chalice of sorcery
The eyes are behind thee
Eyes of thee that bind me
Gods of the skies above thee
Keepers of the seas below me
Seven are those great cities of gold
In names of those seven ancient ones
To never be spoken aloud among thee
For a burning disk would destroy me
Hearken and remember as i speak this
Spirit watchers of the seven zones of Earth
Slept in the sea of spheres and monsters
Whom slain walks in spaces between stars

- Binding of the Eastern Gates - 8:09

By the name i hath been called i command thee to open thy gate
Of a name a number and a form thou have been called to me
Watcher of the chalice.. Speakers of sorcery
Lift my soul above you.. Incant the offerings
Name of Marduk i call.. Dead and dreaming
The mystic seal of gates.. Carved upon my chest
Storms of baneful winds.. Shrouding the lands
Lift my body with force.. Deviltry i howl
Chalice of golden city.. Lords of all magick
Blood of the offering.. I claim unto me 
By the name i hath been called i command thee to open thy gate
Lords of magick and of sword have taken hold of my soul
Deliver us from the bindings of our gods and of our fears
To the gate.. Of the East.. Set thine eyes.. Raise thine sword..
Against lords of abominations i stand fourth and stand firm!
Xul!.. Haunt me!
Xul!.. Deliver me! 
I hold the sacred chalice of the cities of seven before you ancient lords of bane
Exhode!
Xul!.. Bind me!
Xul!.. Chain me!
With strength of the elder ones i stand before you and destroy the chalice of death
Exhode!

- A Catastrophic Ending - 3:21

Seven are they! Seven in name! Seven in number! Seven in Shape!
No Enchantment! No magick! No Evil Fiends! No Sorcery!
The oldest ones! The Elder ones! Ancient Kings! Plague of gods!
Searing rain! Burning frost! Bitter suns! Darkest Waters!
With burning disks the gods of creation spawned in Anu i lash upon the seven 
whom would bind the Zonei in cities of temples of shrines of them and i did 
strike that in name of 4 and she did cry out with blood upon her breath and 
an evil emotion upon her breath she did vanish from me. Name of 2 did lash with 
burning disk and i did stumb in a fleeting motion as the chalice fell upon ground.
All became pale with fear and death!
As the chalice did strike earth a blinding light rose from the seas to stare upon us all.
As my kind known as the Zonei did become as wax upon the sun and the cities of 
seven became as sand upon the shores. All became pale with fear of death!
As a wave of chaos did open before me a darkness shone above me
The vortex that opened and i did enter it for fear of a searing fate
For fear of turning as of wax onto sun as sand unto water as nothing
As i did see my world turned to shards and my people were as dead
Centuries of time did pass as days unto nights of burning sorrow
In wait in lye for a time when time itself may exist yet once more
May the Zonei walk once more among me and may i resurrect cities
For those lone phantoms of the fallen ruins of Kia i wait and i exist..I'll give you space, as you chain me down
I won't let go, but you'll let me fall
I'll see your way, as you avoid mine
I'll give in, so you can walk on me
I'll close my eyes, so you can sew them shut
I'll keep the faith, or you'll crucify me
If I can believe, then you'll believe in meAncient prophecies of future
Tell you what to do, now
Restless memories of darkness
Make you fall to the ground
Unexpected freaks of nature
Rise again from the dead
Evil powers, incantations
Beams of light and shadows

You're not alone and you are strong
The evil now is far and gone
See the light and you will realise

I'm your princess of gold
Princess of gold

Life feels like a stressful journey
We are prisoners of death
Tied in chains and locked in cages
Crying and dying without end
Now you know the truth and
You can fight without mercy
Love's the key to unlock that door
The door of misery, now

All that you want, is all that we are
But all that you need is just what we wantThe shadow seasons have erupted, pagan souls
in slumber
I have foreseen their empire's end
Our souls will re-awaken, to re-kindle the
ebbing flames
A new dawn is approaching, we shall awaken
the winds of mist again swirl as I hear a clash
of steel
"Dark" battles "light" in it's never-ending war
Ancients are summoned, power evermore
Pagan rites are read and all is said and done
"Dark" and "Light" are ended, a new age
has begun(Instrumental)As the populous lie dreamin'
Swallow and digest the fear and lies
Wealth by means of stealth dictate the nation
Shut your mouth, fall in line
Know your station as we curse our creation

Nuclear vision now an obsession
Stealers in for world domination

Trapped in a ring of fire
The world we have built is our funeral pyre

Our eyes are open wide believing
All the pain and suffering of man
A handful of men hold the wealth
Of a hundred nations
They deceive, they deny
Masters of war and disinformation

Nuclear vision now an obsession
Stealers in for world domination

Trapped in a ring of fire
The world we have built is our funeral pyre

Fear, fear drives the world
Humanity not fit to live
Cast false kings down from their thrones

Land of the free in misery
Home of the brave the secret slaves
The Ragnarok of capitalist nations

Life's a lack of meaning when your senses are not true
Believing in the madness with which they condition you!

Clandestine agenda their motives are not clear
Turn their population into creatures of fearBEFORE THE EXILE:

These are the scars of fortune

This is the life he led

Consumed by ignorance

The path beneath his feet

Lost in a pseudo-heaven

Life void of consequence

His ever-present doom

Has never been so close


For all his vile sins

He will be judged this day

Exile in his name

Banished from all that is good


At the left hand of God

He will stay with the goats

Only to enter home

Where torture knows no bounds

There the end is in the past

And the souls will never rest


His tears won't quench his thirst


For in his misery there's too much company

Their screams causing his ears to bleed

And there's no hope, no pity for him

Rapidly we're heading for the stars
Feel, feel the anguish in my eyes
As I whisper the last goodbye
The decision is my own
It's my life

I saw the reflection in your eyes
You know that the mirror never lies
No fear is shadowing my mind anymore

The sound of my heart has tear down the walls around
Our vision is still alive
There is no time to waste
There is nothing to be afraid
Cause we are the weight of the world
We are the world
We are the future

The fire burns under my skin
There is nothing that can stop this impulse
Don't walk away
Don't hesitate
This is your last chance

I crave for the truth inside your eyes 
You know that the mirror never lies
No fear is shadowing my mind anymore

The sound of my heart has tear down the walls around
Our vision is still alive
There is no time to waste
There is nothing to be afraid
Cause we are the weight of the world
We are the world
We are the future
And you are the past

The sound of my heart defies borders or lines,
My voice will arise forgotten beliefs of another place and another time 
So tear down the walls and take your chance cause we are the future, 
We are the weight of the worldWhite under a ceiling of insects, poorly lit, in profile,
Your dress stained by the venom of lamps,
I find you stretched out,
Your mouth higher than a river breaking far away on the
     earth.

Broken being whom the invincible being puts back together,
Presence possessed again in the torch of cold,
O watcher always I find you dead
Douve saying Phoenix I am watching in this cold.We're in the last fortress of mankind
And I fear it's not going to stand
These towers already trembling
Whole nations keep holding their breath

And we wait for the things to come
While our eyes are blind to what lies there beyond

The life we're leading is but a struggle
Without meaning we're trying to survive
As love is a pearl trampled in the dust
Our last wish buried in ashes

Souls grew too tired to seek the wisdom
Hearts protected from light we march to the rhythm of death

Inside those walls of confusion...
...and memories of joy - their colour is fading

Could I find a new place unrevealed
And leave this world of pain
I'd wash myself clean from the dirt of past life
Knowing I'll now find peaceYou don't see 
Fear in me 
Wonder how 
Wonder why"Oh sweet coma, where art thou coma"

-Please, spare me the monologue-

"Theres the spirit. Thank you. Now fuck off and die"

-No need to be rude now-

"It's such a long way down and you make it seem to easy"

By now, he's searching for exits and we're nothing short of invincible.

"Look at us! Look at us!"

Acceptance is a train wreck away!

...Go back to sleep...

Comparing photos. Then and now, now and then. Just wondering what all went wrong.

'Cause baby, you're a hard act to follow.

Eat! Breathe! Fuck! Die!
Eat! Breathe! Fuck! Die!
Eat! Breathe! Fuck! Die!
Eat! Breathe! Fuck! Die!

Animals got it fuckin' easy...Rising from the lake of fire the white swan wings shall burn
Soaring up they take you higher it breaks your smile with every turn
Stretched out into cold horizons are memories of the serpent shore
A silent taste of cursed desires, afraid, but still you long for more 
Defeat, oh horrid vision, leave my mind!

Set me free from the cage of my memories and of my dreams
Open doors to oblivion where sanctified slumber awaits
Be the dreams of ephemeral stature to leave me in time
Leave my private own darkness behind as I pass through the gates

Made restless by conscience I crave for relief 
but I'm wedding my eyes to the hand of a thief
Will my terror at least take my mind off the feast 
and caution me to not fall asleep?
Did I burn all my oil in the eve and my slumber 
so the groom shall pass me left forever to hunger
Still to kindle the fire I'll start and awake 
and beg and plead for my burning soul's sake

Dona nobis pacem

Father, I see the clouds march up to cover the evening sky 
and the stars are but dim lights in abysmal distance, 
Apprehension of the moonlit enigma - of time in reversal, 
suffering eternal, judgement a-coming,
deliver me from this terminal dusk unto the dawn of everlasting light
Damnation beyond the realms of earthly fire, impotent to withdraw, eternal death

Fear not my child, I shall take your hand
If you follow me to the promised land
you shall never fear again

Defeat, itself defeated, fled my mind

Set me free from the cage of my memories and of my dreams
Open doors to oblivion where sanctified slumber awaits
Be the dreams of ephemeral stature to leave me in time
Leave my private own darkness behind as I pass the gatesNecrophilia morbid obsession,
Exciting pictures in my mind,
Smoking unhead female's body,
Exhumed with love in the middle of the night!

Dead but raped
(x3)

Necrophilia sadistic obsession,
Torture dreams in my mind,
Closed little anus,
Melting with her guts...
I come soon!

Dead but raped
(x2)

Necrophilia morbid obsession,
Exciting pictures in my mind,
Smoking unhead female's body,
Exhumed with love in the middle of the night!

Necrophilia sadistic obsession,
Torture dreams in my mind,
My hands, cut up the frozen vaginal door...
Amoral reprehensible charnel act...

Dead but raped
(x3)

Our bodies...
Erotic embrace
On the grave yard grounds...By distress emanate all the cyclones
Demoralizing all the grades of depress
Reflection, defection and destruction
Paraphrase in seven effects
 
Without sign
A masterpiece of endless torn
Never-ending is the light of the unknown...
 
Suncord
 
The only light - The only truth
The eyes of a blind, an ocean of doom
The ultimate methods of birth
The paradise of golden age
 
From the waters
the sounds are recollect... to the sky
A mushroom cloud in distress
Never-ending is the light
of the unknown
 
To the creed of Sun and God...
 
Suncord - a hole in our mind
Suncord - the fire of our kind
 
Never-ending is the light of the unknown
an ancient parasite is yearning for the dawn
The source of Suncord
 
From the pyre we are rising close to the top
Higher than desperation of the golden dawn
As the rays reborn today for the next revenge
Higher than desperation we are bleeding death
 
The only light - The only truth
The eyes of a blind, an ocean of doom
The ultimate methods of birth
The paradise of golden age(Instrumental)The doom of our world
Caresses my dreams
Reality trapped in an endless night
Born of a frozen sun

Humanity as a recollection of the germs that survived
All hope is entombed below the steps of the dead

Locked is the seal to all births
Cracking of the earth the perpetual bell
Red seas color the horizons
Dead calm before the apocalyptic wave

Stories told by the rotting breath
10,000 awakening of the no-return

Hear their choir
Hear their lament
Eternal damnation
Triumph of death

No age, no expression
Free is their mental oppression
Existence is a joke
For human leftovers to choke (on)
Bow down to obscurity
Worship endless infinity

Hear their choir
Hear their lament
Eternal damnation
Triumph of death

Hear them coming
Hear their lament
Eternal damnation
Triumph of death

Risen is the power to unconsciousness
Blowing winds of desperation
Race of soulless corpses
Fill the fields of eternal crosses

Open arms to the unborn breed
Praise the dawnI see through your lying eyes, untruthfull ways that I despise.
Your Justice system makes me sick, walls of silence, brick by brick.
You say the weak you do protect, but it's their lives that you infect....

Pull the strings and cower under man-made bible.
The whole world is run by your corruption,
Pull the strings and cower under man-made bible...

FUCK YOU......

The tables turn....time to expose the bastards.
Unleashing spite...it's time to take them under...under...
What will you say when all your people revolt?
REVOLT....REVOLT....

I see blood running down your eyes, injustice is your life x2

We know your lies....we know them only fucking too well...
We've been decieved, cast down and blasted away...blasted away...blasted away......

I see blood running down your eyes, injustice is your life x2
Your fuckin' life!Standing there alone, the ship is waiting 
All systems are go, are you sure? 
Control is not convinced 
But the computer has the evidence 
No need to abort 

The countdown starts 

Watching in a trance, the crew is certain 
Nothing left to chance, all is working 
Trying to relax, up in the capsule 
"Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom 
The count goes on 

4, 3, 2, 1 
Earth below us, drifting falling 
Floating weightless, calling calling home 

Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit 
Stabilizers up, running perfect 
Starting to collect, requested data 
What will it effect, when all is done 
Thinks Major Tom 

Back at ground control, there is a problem 
Go to rockets full, not responding 
Hello Major Tom, are you receiving 
Turn the thrusters on, we're standing by 
There's no reply 

4, 3, 2, 1 
Earth below us, drifting, falling 
Floating, weightless, calling, calling, home 

Across the stratosphere 
A final message, "Give my wife my love" 
Then nothing more 

Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning 
They don't realize, he's alive 
No one understands but Major Tom sees 
Now the light commands, this is my home 
I'm coming home 

Earth below us, drifting, falling 
Floating, weightless, coming home 
Earth below us, drifting, falling 
Floating, weightless, coming home 

Earth below us, drifting, falling 
Floating, weightless, coming, coming home 
HomeLOST : CROSSED
(THE LAST CRUSADE)
(lyrics by Lars Klingenberg)

At last, we conquered all our fears
The fight went on for years
We broke their fierce domain

Hypocrisy ruled for ages
Twisting all our minds
Our hate grew day by day
Their lies we threw away

The symbol of life was not ours
It will no longer rise
Above our cries

No glory is found anymore
By bearing of the cross
It's just the target
For the wrath of us

Experience
Willful death
You won't be remembered
Heaven's just a taleimagine a city without access to the open sky 
gloomy day is an everyday scene up above 
dark smog thickens my point of embattlement 
i could see, on its face, elucidation of despair 
seen so many times before, so many times 
these pages will not just turn by themselves 
world is so twisted that human life renders no value 
getting worse makes the element of progress 
you could tell wisdom is measured by profits 
granted limits beset chosen destiny 
if only you would swallow and digest everything 
the epitome of greed, was not a single stranger matter 

[february 2013 - september 2014](music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras)

//chorus
I won't take it
there is no evidence
so stop tekking me you are so fuckin' innocent
rock down the place and we'll be fine

I saw you in the middle of the crowd
you were partying hard and singing loud
and all I know, all I know, all I know your look is so deadly

After the show I wanna touch you
I wanna kiss you, I wanna hold you
and the night, the night won't last enough no!

after a bottle of J I feel ready to rock this goddamn place

//chorus

After a shot or two at your place
there is no doubt painted on your face
and your smile, your smile, your smile was oh so dirty

And all the filthy games you wanna play
after the first you're begging me to stay
and my hands, my hands, my hands re going deeper

the mirror is showing your naked behind on top of me

//chorusBlackened sights - reflective memories
Torn thoughts - fatal designs
How to turn up in it ?
Whitch way to go?
Doesn't tell the way rounds moon's disk
But only by night
I feel I'm alive
I breathe in it's power
Looking in open veins
I leave to misery
Slowly surrending to death...
Blackened sights
Torn thoughts
Reasons fall
Found peace...Let me know who I am, I'm not sure where I am
Let me knw what is left, because I'm not sure if I'm here right now
Let me breathe give me air, suffocation is all I know
Can't do it myself, don't know how
Never been taught so i'm nothing nowWE THROW ROSES AND SMALL BIRDS INTO THE GAPING ABYSS AS A GESTURE OF SOLEMN GRATITUDE, LIKE PRIMITIVE MEN PAYING REVERED TRIBUTE TO THE SPIRIT OF A GREAT, GREAT ENEMY; WE OFFER OUR BODIES TO THAT GREAT, MONSTROUS DEPTH, PROCLAIMING IN A MANTRIC THROBBING OF THE VOCAL CHORDS A MOST SINCERE RESPECT TO THE MAGN-IFICENT DEVIL THAT ALMOST SWALLOWED US WHOLE. 

THE LINE BETWEEN WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH CUTS OUR BATTERED HEARTS IN TWO; CAN WE, THEN, ENDURE THE YOKE WE HAVE HUNG OVER OUR SWEAT-STAINED, BRUISING SHOULDERS? WE RETREAT DAY BY DAY TO AN OVERPOWERING ENEMY, BUT THE SPOILS ARE GREAT RICHES WE CAN NOT IMAGINE FOR OURSELVES A LIFE WITHOUT.

IGNOMINY MATES WITH TRIUMPH AND THUS LIFE IS BEGOTTEN; WHEN DARKNESS REARS ITS UGLY FACE TOWARDS MINE, I FEEL! 
I CARVE MY INSIGNIA INTO MY OWN WHITE FLESH; MY GENITALS EVOKE A PROFOUND REPULSION; I DISTURB THIS UNENVIABLE SHROUD OF FLESH - THIS SWOLLEN MASS, THIS PINK SKIN, THESE OVARIES, THIS CERVIX, UTERUS AND CLITORIS...THESE FRAIL STRAWS OF They've invited all of their feline friends

Of a precious ring
has become a legend,
The hardest to forget.

Many years ago
In other times,
In other places,
Evil has existed

Thousands of souls
and spirits were by
Nobody could avoid it,
Everyone has surrendered,
Everyone had surrendered.

[CORO]

Sadness and agony ruled, uh
in the golden lands,
Until the day the ring was found
By the simplest creature on earth.

[SOLO]

Frodo they used to call him
He didn't know what power was,
But one day the ring shined so bright
So bright it was love.

The beasts have hidden again,
The peace got back to stay
Hoping to survive in the realm of these lands

Only one man could save them from dark,
The owner of the most marvellous ring
The one man who had searched in his heart
To find the key of power

[CORO]

Sadness and agony ruled, uh
In the golden lands,
Until one day the ring was found
By the simplest creature on earth.You need chiropractic
Life-long chiropractic
Cradle-to-grave chiropractic
Now world-wide, chiropractic

My chiropractor is not a doctor
My chiropractor used to manage a McDonald's
Then he took a course so he could serve us best
My right leg he says, is longer than my left

In a storefront that used to be a yogurt shop
He performs treatments to get the pain to stop
Here he roughs you up until your bones snap
Insurance won't cover this, they're living in the past

Four X-rays, now we know

Constipation and depression, traced to your spine
Greeted by a pretty lady, two documents to sign
Three times weekly, in 9 months you should be well
Then it's once a week, until you die and go to HellDown, let the body fall
Deep, into the blackness of a hole
Leave the waking world
Submerge, into the temple below

A dream yet still so real
All is silent, tranquil
The time stands still
Between the sleep and vigilI am waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel
Is tranquility

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon

I've been waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

I've been waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel
Is tranquility

There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear

And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better
Than when they were opened

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soonAbschurfungepoch (repeated 8 times)

  	Abschurfungepoch (repeated 8 times)Evil souls of the night
Feasting in the fog
Like children dancing in a circle of fire
We give tribute to our mother moon
We feel her presence high above us
Like a queen in her nightly throne
...and when the shadows beat the light
She embraces us with her sorrow
Doom sorrow and hate
Evil side of the moon
Nothing will keep us apart
Oh, queen from your dark side
Your throne of doom will always
Reign in the night(Instrumental)When distrust and understanding combine and the white kingdom closes its gates dropping you back among the filth back to face the life without the meaning, without the meaning. Then you experience the birth and the filth like a cleansing stream. You swim in the spring of rats and vermin, you tilt over the cup of revolt. This all incarnated in your mind, your body hanging like a staging. Stain yourself with the tar, it soaks into your heart. Saturated with the fuel, hate becomes a glowimg spark. All bursts into black storm, into infernal radiance. You tar-filled skin burns their thougths. Dirt, filth and flames are rising close to the gates...Transcending a mere multiverse...

The watery mind of alien expansion,
Neath yawning seas
In sinisterious exploration
Of multiversal conundrum
Puzzling constellations into unseen patterns -
Forcing the stars right.

Envision all futuristic angles dreamworking to
Dimensions of super-strata one psyches with the
Omnipresent awareness - of a billion psyches,
Dividing filling infinity becoming everywhere
And everywhen - manifesting superabundance
All impossibilities to the contrary

The predawn magical science is mathematic
Unlock the Gates of Cosmos.Something's not quite right
Something evil in the air tonight
You feel desire burning
The cold sweat of unclean yearning
I'm in the shadow of your mind
In the realm of dreams you'll find
That I am of your flesh
Born of your lust
I'm your demon lover
Incubus!

I'm a bat out of hell
and I'm coming for you
I'm your worst nightmare
I'm your darkest dream come true

Incubus!
I come to you in your sleep
When the morning comes
You find blood on your sheets
I will possess you body and soul
You're under my control

I'm the angel of death
With amphetamine eyes
I'm the sinking feeling
Between your thighs
Deeper inside until I reach your heart
Then piece by piece I tear you apart

I will possess you
Body and soul
Your destruction
Has become my goal
I'm a bat out of hell
and I'm coming for you
I'm your worst nightmare
I'm your darkest dream come true(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Sexy thong bikinis
Are the latest rage
I package them in small bags
I make minimum wage
Insert a square of cardboard
Sticker the front, and I'm through
Most of us who work here
Start the day by sniffing glue

Mr. Bus Driver
Hurry it along
Four days straight now
I've done wrong
I've been late for my job
Packing up thongs
Mr. Bus Driver
Hurry it along

The bags are made in China
The thongs assembled in Macao
The girls on the beach are nearly naked
I wish I was with them now
It's hot and it's sweaty
In this warehouse, and between their legs
We are all frustrated people
Human powderkegs

Mr. Bus Driver
Hurry it along
My state caseworker
Will say he knew it all along
That I was unfit
That I do not belong
Mr. Bus Driver
Hurry it along(Instrumental)Lights Became just shadows upon the wall, stories we used to whisper secrets said but never told. Awaken in the morrow hung under when solids are liquified. Pondering about existance when hollow tunes echoe through my head, listening to pointless violence summon in the voice of the dead. Wake from the dream to the scene of chaotic screaming I pause through this life thinking of all that I've left behind. Burrowed underneath a soil so sweet and full of light twisting its tendrels choking us its brought us all back to life. So sick and young a new day has come to thread the fashions of fate over shoulder we turn but we never seem to walk away. Petals fall as I taste the way the beauty of the sun colours my face. Awaken through the strife to the scene of chaotic screaming, pausing through this life thinking of all that I've left behind. Autumn begins to settle in heart beats raining down our destruction. Poisoned in our seedling state on and on refuse to admit mistake. Trapt within this hate of mine turning sour and contrived. Wake from the dream to the scene of chaotic screaming, pause through the strife thinking of all that I've left behind. Life begins again. Ambience of autumn elemental disorder a change in the water. Circled forever cling on to sorrow no more tomorrow. Ambience of autumn elemental disorder a change in the water. Cling on to sorrow, no more tomorrow, a world without a halo. Standing up right to prove that your alive, evolve your head to show that you survive. Stompin your feet to prove that you can fight and you can die. Changing your rights to fuck up your whole life, forcing your hand towards their sacrifice, evolve your head annd prove that you can fight and you can die.
-AMBIENCE OF AUTUMNLife is a constant race, also a
Performance. and an infamous
Battle, never thought. hate....
But everyone has got in his
Inner self problems, questions,
Joys, gloomy thoughts and
Ambitions. no one knows what
Is happening in my mind and no
One knows what is settled in the
Deepest part of my soul
Feelings, produced by your
Inner self and controlled by
Your inner cosmos. the world
In your self is a result of your
Dreams and your personality
Imagination is the key for
Creation. life is a deal, with
Your inner self, and with other
People, worse human beings
Hate,... when the flame, in your
Inner cosmos burns away,
Emptiness. death.... but
Everyone has control over the
Flame. the flame which lives in
Your inner self. the flame

Which gives you power
Which keeps your soul alive
And feeds your imagination or
Frustrations. thoughts, ejected
By your brain and arranged by
Your inner cosmos. the mirror
Picture of what you feel
Emotions, good or bad values
Created and controlled by your
Self formed characterthis is not a fairy tale
this is the fight for the cause
when two masses are confront
the ones you defeated 
with your own blood

where is the glory?
is only scars of war!!!

see what you become
a massive murder
of this world of lies

scars of war

I was there in the back stage,
When first light came around.
I grew up like a changeling,
To win the first time around.
I can see all the weakness.
I can pick all the faults.
Well I concede all the faith tests,
Just to stick in your throats.

31G, 31G, 31G

I hung around in your soundtrack,
To mirror all that you've done,
To find the right side of reason,
To kill the three lies for one,
I can see all the cold facts.
I can see through your eyes.
All this talk made no contact.
No matter how hard we tried.

31G, 31G, 31G

I can still hear the footsteps.
I can see only walls.
I slid into your man-traps,
With no hearing at all.
I just see contradiction,
Had to give up the fight,
Just to live in the past tense,
To make believe you were right.

31G, 31G, 31G

You can't fight what you are (X2) 
You're still running, from yourself

No escape, from your own hell
Fear, Hunter

You can't help but be the hunter,

Hey man...Many years ago today
Something grew inside of your
Mother...
That thing was you

YOU

Did she scream did she cry
Only those that are born
Are the ones that
Get to die

One more year closer to dying
Rotting organs ripping grinding
Biological discordance
Birthday equals self abhorrence

Years keep passing aging always
Mutate into vapid slugs
Doctor gives a new prescription
Bullet in a fucking gun

One more year closer to dying
Plastic surgeons fuel the lying
You forget why you came in here
Your mind rots with every New Year

For the DETH of thee
You have little time
And you're running out of life

Happy Birthday
You're gonna die

Now you're old and full of hatred
Take a pill to masturbatred
Children point to you and scream
Because they will become that thing

One more year of further suffering
There's no point in fucking bluffing
Open up your DETHDAY present
It's a box of fucking nothing

PLEASE
For the DETH of thee
You have little time
And you're running out of life

Happy Birthday
You're gonna dieHe's gonna bust your head with a bat
Then he'll take out your kids with a gat
This time he's really coming back
Revenge of Bo Jackson! Yeah!
Bo Breaker!You're standing at the crossroads 
and you're wondering which way to turn
Should you save your soul for heaven?
Or should you let it burn?
Choose the left hand path
and embrace the endless night
Reject the lies and falsehoods of the
Hypocrites on the right

If you are truly a child of the darkness
If you were born to walk this road
You must sever your ties
from all mankind.. the time has come to
Kiss the Goat!

Debase yourself with a kiss of shame
Let your inhibitions go up in flames
Kiss the Goat.. seal the pact
Show your devotion with a blasphemous act

Kneel before your lord and master
...say you will serve him forever after
Kiss the Goat! Prove your worth
our Master Satan.. Lord of this earth

Pledge the allegiance that a prince deserves
Serve Satan as he's meant to be served!

Kiss the Goat.. seal the pact
Show your devotion with a blasphemous act
Kiss the Goat! Prove your worth
to our Master Satan.. Lord of this earth

Who among you is ready.. to deny the false
god Jehovah and his bastard son Christ
the masochistic liar?
Who dares pledge allegience to the Prince of Darkness?
Come forward and be baptized in the name of our Lord Satan
Kiss the Goat and reap the rewards you are due!
As Judas betrayed the king of the slaves
like a pledge of love eternal.. press your lips
Against the future and become your own redeemer!Say, can you see the cross? 
Inverted solemnly 
Symbol for the goat 
Of a thousand young 

Six six six 
Evoke the king of hell 
Strike the death knell 

Death knell 
Say, can you hear the chimes? 
Tolls now for the end 
Bells call out their doom 
As victor reaches womb 

Sex sex sex 
Receive the beast of evil 
Of evil... 

Can you say his name? 
Carrier of the light 
Legions of this seed 
A child you as spouse will feed 

S-A-T-A-N 
Under spell 
Of the death knell 
Death knellNothing in my house but cold words for a long life, abandoned to my need. Nothing in my house but long nights in a cold bed, hollowed out by grief. One second in the shadow would freeze my veins. One moment in the sunlight would burn me away. So my silence has lasted years. Can you hear me now? One word to fall, light as a feather, and bring your father down. That's all I have left. A bitter end to a joyful life. That's all I have left, one breath into the next and then it stops. That's all I have left. I see it coming and I cannot look away. I could have had all of it, but I turned my back on it, and the worms tunneled in my blood. Enter me, feed on me. My skin is not my own. Enter me, feed on me, and die without a home. Til then there's no relief. The mind is set to wander, while the body lingers on. There's nothing in my house. A door has been thrown wide. The thief has come and gone. And the worst part of it is that I'm still inside of it, and I can see you all from here, but never say a word. I'm fed through a tube, and shit into a tube, in the corner of a room that I'll never, ever leave, ever again. Every kind word I hear is from a stranger. Every day I'm washed, turned on my side, and left to rot. Every day I'm more like an animal, confined inside. That's all I have left - a painful end, though it come in silence. That's all I have left. Closing doors and distant voices. Here is all I need, drugged until my eyes glaze over. I remember who you are, though you've forgotten me by now. Minutes pass like days. Every night's the same. Before we're divided, look at me once more. I am not the father you adore. First my body withers, then it burns, and then to the river near my home I will return. A cloud is on my vision, but the road is clear: you can leave right now, and I will die right here.We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of ours
Thus we focus on your death(Instrumental)When the reflections of memory collapse, 
The bleeding colors of grief dyes my heart, 
By hands and knees, I creep to where love abides, 
The circle rides the coil all around 

Storms of fury turns the tides of bliss, 
Thus brings a trap, a cage to the abyss, 
Oh, so high, the walls I aim, 
Only outside the window panes, 
Through these sunken halls of shame, 
To where the winds propel the rain, 
My soul crashes upon the shores, 
Where I found mine, and you found yours 

It seems the captain was deranged, 
Fished for love but landed misery, 
Swallow pride and yearn for more, 
The vessel collapses, sail torn 

A stranger in the mirror, by the looking glass, 
A danger in the view, not seeing past 

Who are we now?(Eklundh)

I used to be a man of dignity
A man of my word
You could depend on me

It hurts so fine
When you cross that line
The point of no return

I used to preach strict morality
An ethical man
Complete credibility

You try and try
Then Greed comes by
And you crash and burn

I need to believe in you
I need to have faith in you
I need to rely upon you
I need you...

The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots

We crawl through your weak pathetic brain
We thrive on your guilt
We thrive on your pain

Hideous crimes
For nickels and dimes
We corrupt your soul

I need to believe in you
I need to have faith in you
I need to rely upon you
I need you...

The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots...Challenge the very essence of sanity,
By constantly shifting normality.
To you I am a clown dancing alone,
But I am a conductor of the stars

In the land of Fog, I am King.
The Lord of my own creations.
Will you pass the gatekeeper and come in,
To hear my inane proclamations?

Strip the truth bare, see it naked and cold.
See it in perspective to where you are.
"But remember the orbital transcendance illusion"
By the time you've seen me, I'm gone.

Forever passing to the land of Fog,
Shooting stars are the glints of my heels
There is thunder at the door waiting to come in,
I should go now to answer its call.

'Sky surfing stars in a sea of everness.
Their screeching breaks, echoing in the blackness.
They turn and gather, flying flends of hell.
Trying to trap you in their webs of doom!'
When stating destinations, the price must be paid.
To pass the test of time, through which the mind is decayed.

Caught now in my own shrunken world,
The transmission's broken down.
Danger sirens are echoing from within,
Only time will tell if I get back home.
The key to unlock insanity is hanging from the stars...
 
Caught now in my own shrunken world,
The transmission's broken down.
Danger sirens are echoing from within,
Only time will tell if I get back home.

The key to unlock insanity is hanging from the stars...(Instrumental)Our sun is set, our day is done, I'm left here wondering
Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night and now you're gone, I'm left here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through?

You were the wind beneath my wings
Taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings
How could this ever die?

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
...and I always will be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life
Taught me to be free
Now I'm a stranger in your eyes
Walls are closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
...and I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are The One
...and you always will be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn
But after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright?

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
...and I always will be
Missing you, in my heart you are The One
...and you always will be

Nah-nah-na... and you always will be
Nah-nah-na... and you always will be
...and you always will be
...my little one you are
...and you always will be(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I don't believe nothing except
That the earth is beneath my feet
And the original plan for man
Hunt, kill, fuck, and eat

Return to the days when men lived out of caves

Believe nothing, trust no one, forget everything
Brutal, tribal, neanderthal
The birth of man is still primal
Civilization wouldn't be missed
The dollar wouldn't exist

Believe nothing, believe nothing

Believe nothing they teach or
Anything they preach of
Believe nothing you're told or what you read
Believe nothing's for free
When lives come cheap
And the strong still feast off the weak

Believe nothing from me
Or anything I speak
Cuz I only believe what's inside
And things myself I seeConfronted massive armies 
Clash for forgotten lands 
I oppose the enemy 
To overthrow their few 
Dispensing of my thousands 
Promising them the riches 
Mercenaries marching on 
Prevailing at my call 

I come to command 
This forgotten land 
I must control them all 
They all must fall 
I am the one 
Godly in my stature 
Leader of these men 
Conqueror of all 

Men standing under command 
waiting for my orders 
Lands to rule far away 
Come to take it all 
I am of many powers 
Leader of the countless 
Mocking the attempts 
Of all in my way 

Hear of me and live in fear 
The one who dominates 
Bringing your homes to their knees 
Another land to rule 
Nominal forces pushed aside 
My men never seize 
Followers of my orders 
Crush under foot 

Men scatter in terror 
At what their eyes behold 
Masses rising high 
As men flock to me 
Legend amongst mankind 
Forever standing tall 
Commander of my realm 
Monarch to its groundsFernando got fired
Now he's broke
He's on welfare
He ate a dog
Now he's out for blood
Raul is on the run
Fuck unemploymentSecular agony in vain
Times that tear my soul
My blood is so bitter as the hate
Abstinence of life and kindness

I already saw many gods die in the graces
and I felt Proserpine at my side
In many grounds I will be still buried
Tears will fall from the bastard

Equilibrium between fertility and death
Eternal seas in fury
The thunders that try kill me disappeared
Visit me in the Hell or EarthDying ocean, dead head
Watchin' the figures
March without soul

Observe the pages
Safe place
Without your sky
Full of me
Full of me

Dying ocean, dead head
Watchin' all the figures
Walk without soul
Without soul
Without soul(Instrumental)Moon guides the hunter
Terror brought by night
Rhythms of the ritual
These souls know no silence
Translations with multiple meanings
Soil fertile with blood
Creatures armed with venom
Aliens to love of life
Entrances to deeper levels
Invocations for devilish encounters
What's death if not the actual beginning
Dream is as true as one's soul
These halls are neverending
Passages for greater self
As guardian you are your enemy
The key is behind your soul(Instrumental)5. Whispering Death 

Darkness speaks from the depths of night
Dance of death beneath evil skies
Woods will sing these tunes of night
As watchful stars grip tranquil skies

Daylight hides from a new moonrise 
Casting spell on fateful lives
Whispering death - on a silent night 
Through the shade of undead eyes

(Lead - Nitin)

Darkness speaks from the depths of night
Dance of death beneath evil skies
Woods will sing these tunes of night
As watchful stars grip tranquil skies

Daylight hides from a new moonrise 
Casting spell on fateful lives
Whispering death - on a silent night 
Through the shade of undead eyes

(Lead - Nitin)

Darkness speaks from the depths of night
Dance of death beneath evil skies
Whispering death - on a silent night 
Dripping rage of mournful skiesWe returned at dusk to the green walls, 
the spacious cold echoing luridly
between the growths that sat and yawned
alongside the river's rim. 
Each turn pressed us further into its depths 

If we shut our eyes, 
we saw their faces 
submerged in the darkness 
hypnotic and frigid, 
lips parted, 
plodding in the mud. 
Their brains deranged by the moon
 
At dawn we embarked upon the soil. 
We stood insensate, in awe, 
of the unlit pit of the earth 

We found them all dead: 
ubiquitous, nameless, naked in the dirtRavens spread their wings
As the sun comes down
And the old priest shelters

Bearers of death, carry their pest
Raping the-church, the land they infest

Prepare to die!
The dead shall reign
Prepare to die!

Buried down below - blinded by evil

For every century
Descendants fall one by one
In hellish nights of torture
And diabolic lust for blood

Dampening the ground with lost souls...
Dampening the ground... kill!!!

Rising from the deep
From the bowels of a glowing hell
Hell on earth, the dead shall reign
The end of this nightmare no one will tell
They are beasts to ruin mankind
Human blood and flesh is the food

...take your life by spell..

Vengeance boils from hell
They will take your life by spell

Angels are possessed
I buried in the sands
Angels are possessed
Buried down below!(Instrumental)No phoenix rises from the ruined walls
I ponder now the grief of many rooms
The shadows, the colors turning
The vestal moon, the violating sun
Oh soft embalmer of the still midnight
You call to me from across the rotting sea
Rain suspended in the skyIn a rate a circle run 
A permanent score 
Left for settle on the plain 
Shudder 
According to bearings 
Or assembling 
Piles in ties, all in vain 

Redundant 
Fighting these alleged barriers 
Null 
Relaps and recollected 
Deteriorated whole 
Not an option 

Neither sight nor have I aim 
No way or compass 
While asleep or wide awake 
No feet or surface 

Absence of meaning, chaotic 
Talk nine teen to the dozen 
Guns over no warranty 
Taking war nearer 
Add your steps over 

Redundant 
Fighting these alleged barriers 
Null 
Elapse and recollected 
Deteriorated whole 
Not a fucking option 

The notions failed on me 
When I thought, 
I thought 
I had it right 
Tongues tide me mute 
Hands tide 
No plain need catching me at sight 

So much for 
Waking up: Good night 
So much for 
Waking up: Good night 

Neither sight nor have I aim 
No way or compass 
While asleep or wide awake 
No feet or surface(Instrumental)Reaching beyond the set limits
The morbid nature of humanity unveils
Hesitation leaves room for instinct
And a new dimension of opportunities unfolds
Nothing will ever be the same
When the former truth now is deranged
And the once so flaming love
Turns out to be cold hatred

Evilution - The New World Order

It spreads like a disease
When arch enemies unite
Against the rotting law
That tells what's wrong and right
Cross the line and breed the revolution
So that your own thoughts
Will lead you to eternal victory
Over the set norms

Evilution - The New World Order

Millenniums of humiliation
Have now come to an end
Evolution has reached it's climax

Evilution - The New World OrderWho is this that lies here before me 
Hollow shell of a man 
Seems to be in need of sedation 
Can you speak, can you stand 
Let me show you the way to take flight 
I know that which you see 
Step outside of the square my friend 
Now on the way to be free 

I try to blink my eyes in desperation, to clear illusions to no avail
Here I stand on a platform of surrender, I stare direct into myself 
Losing grip of reality, with every passing moment 

Take the step and you'll see quite clearly 
Let go all that shall bind 

I stare direct into the future 

Gravity, a concept my body starts rejecting 
weightlessness comes into existence 
No longer held by the limitations I've created 

Above the ground, away I must find 
Now my doubts come to rise 
If this is the time for what's to come 
How could I truly know 
Do we ever truly know... 
Spinning out of control, away away. 

Into the stream, beyond the stratosphere I've gone, a panic increases, I must focus and release. 
Uncharted turbulent journey I am on 
Now is the time for what's to come.With the snow up to our knees
All I can think is how you'll be
First to be eatenThe lady she sleeps: oh! may her sleep
As it is lasting so be deep
No icy worms about her creep
I pray to God that she may lie
For ever with as calm an eye
That chamber chang'd for one more holy
That bed for one more melancholy
Far in the forest, dim and old
For her may some tall vault unfold
Against whose sounding door she hath thrown
In childhood, many an idle stone
Some tomb, which oft hath flung its back
And vampire-winged panels back
Flutt'ring triumphant o'er the palls
Of her old family funeralsFor the one who could never believe,
Who was victim of obsolete errancies
Fatuous being is hard to forgive,
His last words are pronounced in silence.

I remember her praying for him, 
For his soul that could never be saved,
Murky forebodings and endless scream
Smithereens of old mother's heart.

Time to finish regrets and complains,
Be prepared to enter the Last World.
You have lost the right way, but you still have a chance,
After you will be born once again!

Crucified on the cross of your fear,
You clamber the rest of your life span. 
Everything is in vain, doom has its own laws.
Fate of mortals is always the same.

There was once the tree of high hopes.
Now it's drown, all the leaves have fallen.
But the al mother's voice is still there,
the voice in the silence is still... calling.(Instrumental)I'm able to-to end your life
Oozing red sauce is coming out of your nose
Knee-deep in mud on the way you search for
Can you feel to the addiction to gore
When the master is calling and you know what he wants
You don't stop falling till you try the fresh wound
Pus looks like water meat is just made of sand
You think that you better I will teach you're the end

Bad infections of innards worry you 
A bladder big like a melon it can't be true
Your genitals really don't look good
The blood of putrefaction in your neighborhood

You convulse your body your spleen fails
Itching secretion can't realize space
I lost my reaction moral takes a break
When infector has spoken it can't be fake
Tasting the bitches must be the pleasure of life
And if you don't do it you have to pay the price
The calling is only a silent voice in your dick
You can't understand you going to be sickSoul Insanity

He psychiatrist what can I do
I think my life needs something new
I want to be the one I should be
This is the story of soul insanity

A raging soul inside
Destroying everything I want
What made me change
This isn't me. I'm going insane

We're seeking to happiness in our lives
That's what we're living for
The soul should keep me strong
But rage and insanity make my soul forget

Forget

I'm lost in my own self-esteem 
Nothing will succeed only in my dreams
Waiting for what comes next 
In this world I'm trapped 

Living in chaos everyday 
No luck how could I care 
I'm used to it, so don't tell me
I have nothing more to say 

A raging soul inside 
Destroying everything I want
What made me change 
This isn't me. I'm going insane 

Damn this world 
Only pain and hate 
There's nothing more 
I'm only hate and war 

I roam in my own thoughts
This isn't what I'd planned 
I Cannot stand the truth 
My Life becomes untrue 

I think you'd better kill yourselfNow it is dawn and a new day is born
But with a trail of despair
The new day was shining but many had gone
Farmer Ferdinand Hudson had lost much more than he'd won
He sat by a table and cried in his rum

The cobwebs hung heavy and dreary beside
All that looked at him could barely decide
He passed for one day so to sleep in that night
And early that morning he died=RECOVERY GRID/DIVERT POWER LOAD=

Razing the cemetery, leave no bones Armed with a bag of tsombi powder and a hastily drawn map, Samedi gains entrance to the catacombs only to find four hooded imbeciles trying to huff sewage fumes from a mummified skull. He offers his wares and three of the mutants greedily accept, with predictable results... 

Brain Jerk 

Friday night and I needed a thrill 
I'd swilled all the rot gut that I want to swill 
And numbskull wasn't fitting the bill 
Dug up a junkie, I shot up his brains 
Inhaled some jenkem through a jugular vein 
But nothing worked and I'm starting to twitch 
"I've got a concoction that will scratch at that itch" 

Brain Jerk! 

He had a skull full of voodoo blow 
An avalanche of Caribbean snow 
"What's in this shit?" "You don't wanna know..." 
We blew some rails, we got loose 
Settling in for a night of abuse 
Dissector left with a flimsy excuse 

The walls began to bleed 
The catacombs to heave 
Glowing serpents burrowed through 
The melting cosmic void 
Screaming through the nothingness 
Our addled minds destroyed 
Destroyed! 

Madness! Piercing the veil 
Perceptions were warped, senses assailed 
Crystalline thought-waves,luminous gloom 
Organic magma, edible doom 
Dilated pulsating orbs 
One with the aether, egos absorbed 
Phantasms shrieking, babies aflame 
"I think this is bunk..." 
"Man, that's totally lame" 

It started kicking in 
Fermentor cracked a toothless grin 
A feeling so bizarre 
"Tear this fucking place apart!"

Solo Dissector

Brain Jerk!In times I have been there, searching back for reminitions. 
Fighting to see the untouchable, breaking my conscience. 
FALL!! 
For two seconds in a blur I recall how it fucking felt, 
confronting with the goddamn hurt, I saw through your mask. 
If two seconds it did'nt hurt I'd remember how it fucking felt, 
but now I know that at birth my cards were already delt! 
Was it decided for you? Fighting to get by 
Was it decided for you? 
Your world divided in two! Fighting against time 
Was it decided for you? 

FALL!! 
Was it decided for you? Fighting to get by 
Was it decided for you? 
Your world divided in two! Fighting against time 
Was it decided for you? 
In times I have been there, searching back for reminitions. 
Fighting to see the untouchable.These feelings I can\'t explain
Months and even years of yearning
For the beauty that never come
Each day I find dying souls
I know we have to enkoy the life
Yet I\'m stil complaining everything
Ever seems like never... no more
Colors translated as black insight
Over shadowed by uncertanty
When will it become calm again
Storms of dissilution wrecked my mind
Pull me to state of total chaos
I know we have to enjoy the light
Yet I\'m stil complaining everything
Where is my fate as I had in the past
I need to get it back right now !into the mouth of madness flies
an albatross inside my mind
the nighttime comes and I will cry
the silence when I close my eyes

I cannot breathe, I cannot see
this darkness that envelopes me
all my life I've built these walls
waiting till the darkness falls

headstones and heartbreak
falling in around me
photographs, my memories
why do they escape me

all this booze clouds my mind
and heroin it let's me fly
but when I fall, I burn and cry
only if I fail to die

headstones and heartbreak
falling in around me
photographs, my memories
why do they escape me

my eyes have seen the glory
the coming of The Lord, yeah
my eyes have seen the horror
a wretched, little whore's prayer

into the mouth of madness
living in the throes of sadness

headstones and heartbreak
falling in around me
photographs, my memories
why do they escape me

my eyes have seen the glory
the coming of The Lord, yeah
my eyes have seen the horror
a wretched, little whore's prayerPeople are always talking in this little town
We are its pride and its shame
So we come up in conversation now and again.
I knew something was wrong
When I overheard a Mormon elder at the Burger King
Talking about how to bring the dead boy peace

There was a drowning in Coalinga
An accidental death, the boy died
Now when this kind of thing happens
They all start talking about us even more
They say the dead boy's life was stolen
But we were willing to throw ours away

I have said time and time again
That our failed suicide pact was a mistake
But because we have not cut our hair
And joined up with the Mormon Church
There's always been this lingering feeling
That we think what we did was right

You can't bring the dead boy peace
By scowling at those of us who are alive
We didn't kill your son sorry please
You'll never bring the dead boy peace.

I didn't know the dead boy
But I placed a bouquet of spirulina on his grave
There's no hidden messages in our music
It's all printed there on the lyric sleeve
Pied pipers of death? I can barely breathe!
Now get off our cases pleaseThe most malicious, the most sadistic 
A crude surgeon well versed in gore 
The grandest schemer, the coldest creeper 
You set the standard for low 

Your perfect prey, Poor lonely soul 
The woman of his dreams 
You are a sight to behold 

A callous mind, with frozen fingers 
The bodies pile 
As your profit margins soar 

You lead the fly, into your web 
A desperate fool 
Searching for companionship 

Down into a tub of ice 
Cutting deeper with her knife 
Thought you were some lucky schmuch 
Your organs are all fucked 
Thought he found company 
Turned into misery 
A bleeding, gaping hole 
Fresh organs to be sold 

Note dripping down the mirror 
Is it written in my blood? 
Cold tiles on my skin

Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey Satan, payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land

I'm on the highway to hell
(Don't stop me)

And I'm going down, all the way down
I'm on the highway to hellWandering the night
carrying my lucidity
watch the stars ...

dig my own grave
I think it is too late for another choice
I need to disappear.
I need to hide

run away from me
once again tried to find anything
once again I completely elude
I just have to desappear

the illusion dragged me easily
tried to escape with blinded eyes
I'll go away... 
Please... leave-me... in peace...
I just want to be in peace...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The cold
the fridged heart
that I feel

without doubt
Living in shadows
I can feed
Al this Pain
No releif
Soon the sun
will take me

On the edge of immortality
noone fells the levity
Oh why must it be the sun
and not the moon

It curses me

The cold night
The daylight
My soul flight
Lost all lifePleasure push me suffocation, turns into aggression 
 Crossing over slightly faces, two fold mutilation 

 ....Escaping fear 
 ....Life erosion 
 Hidden....lost.... 
 Hidden, watching, life erosion, sorrow 

 Extreme....noise.... 

 A deadly fist between the eyes 
 Erotic mind reaction 
 Poison rules, escaping fear 
 Cries in heaven, life erosion 

 Extreme....noise.... 

 A deadly fist between the eyes 
 Erotic mind reaction 

 Extreme....noise....(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Desperation, through your eyes I'm overcome 
True divine belongers don't hold their weight in gold 
Truth defined, blasted lovers are supposed 
But we were wrong 

Disillusioned, embrace my display through mere design 
To the onset of the twilight, distant escapades of drear 
Fall like vines onto dead soil 
In the harmony conjoined, rested there our souls adhere 

We belong to the fallen sands 
The blood of the martyred souls basked in day 
Send a line to the world and when you hear the sound 
You'll know you've found yourself the way 

Under the stars I waited while you plunged into the future all alone 
Past exhaustion can I further myself above? 
This affair has turned to vapor, there and gone 
This intoxicating evening weeps alongManufacture consent right from the start
To get this global governing down to an art.
Kill those who oppose and see through your lies
Fund corrupt politicians for a disguise.
Brainwash the masses through media control
Tear down religion and belief in the soul.

Destroy education to remove any threat
Indenture the workers in un-payable debt
Create your opponent in a neighbouring land
Attack your own people with the hidden hand.
Fund both sides in a global war
Arm them to the teeth so you can settle the score.

When peace breaks out, the hit them again
Remember they are cattle and we're better than them.
Create killer disease and withold the cure
It won't affect us because we keep our blood pure
The time is at hand to remove your disguise
You've conquered the world - the ultimate prize.Understanding the patterns of social life
to bring forth contradictory goals
There is no double-standard in any stance
to fight for something worth to fight for

A clash of interests
Reconciliation is nonsense
When law has been paralyzed,
regulations out of order
Who wants to bring a fresh air to this sick violent world?
Smell of death as we breathe
Can we make a stand?

Mass confusion in the wake of grand ignorance
Political maneuvers, dancing on a vicious circle
"Divide et impera," a plot of reducing power of pawns
We people are just too uneducated to be aware

A clash of interests
Victim of a new democratic atmosphere
The ones with necrophilic minds shall rise,
and none can stop them as everyone's free

Who dares to bring a fresh air to this sick violent world?
Smell of death as we breathe
Can we make a stand?

An opera of madness we found each day
Waging destruction, fascination on deaths
With such weapons and C4's ready to kill
Paranoid grandiosity or necrophilic fantasy? 

(Yo - Yo)
Time for confirmation, to speak louder than before
A life in a violent society
We shall stand!
(Yo - Yo)

An opera of madness we found each day
With such weapons and C4's ready to kill
Paranoid grandiosity or necrophilic fantasy?(Excommunication of Resistance)
Stoop not down before those darkened waters...
Kneel not down unto that darkly shining abyss... 

Life as death, night to day.. Centuries crawl, and fade away..
Race of men, kings of earth... turn your head, pawns unhearing..
Life as death, sits in wait... fallen son to a king of fate..
Wars of heaven, scorch the skies.. descending angel in pyre cries..
Rebel cherubim bound, to lakes of fire
Cast out the wicked, left to suffer
Forthwith he rises, burning with malice
Charred in horrid vale, filled of dark designs
Amidst flame gathers stygian council in throes of despair
Speak thee of terms to war
Seraphic lords and cherubim gather on golden chair
Speak thee to terms of life
Expanse filled with the hiss of the rustling winged
Speak thee to terms of death
As summons was read, the great consult began!
Speak thee to terms of war 

(Council of Abaddon)
Upon exalted throne sat he most high to bring word of war with heaven, scorching the sky
Deicide! 
Vengeance! 
Is mine! 

Sounds of thunder fill the vast expanse as this was not their single host
To war with heaven once more would bring eternal pain none would dare
As lord Belial most fair did rise to tell of their even worsening despair
Speak we of war once more, as we have before
To raise our swords in haste, eternal sulphur pyre we taste
Speak thee in terms of war as we shall suffer more
To rise with wings of death, spilling heavenly crimson 
Hear my council, despise we may
To scorch the crimson skies, ephemeral demise 

Hearken kings, Lords of hell
Empyrean Gods! Destiny calls!
Cloaked in garb, Of reason's being
Sufficient have stood, though free to fall
Rise to fall, Chaos for eternity
Subterranea, beguiled limbo
Hearken lords, Kings of hell
Enslaved we are, Rueful eternity Thus their caliph rose to them and in thunder spoke of war and hell, heaven and peace
In heaven they would bear upon thrones an unconquerable wealth of destruction and slaughter
Kingdom come
It shall be done!
Vehemently the voices of seraphim enveloped those burning caverns
Such that the lands of earth were up heaved and torn into molten flame
Unto them he threw silence! Attend yourselves to my words cherubim
Diverge our minds from war and turn to.... resurrection! 

(A Transversal of Mythologies)
There are times before him, there have been gods of elder creation
Before his inception wars of unbeknownst time were waged of dimensions
The remark of our plight lies in ash, soil and time.. resurrection!
Deities of unimagined dynamism.. Remark to our vindication! 

O' myriads of immortal spirits hear my words of grievance and exhumation! 

In death we trust o' gods of a time unknown and a place unspoken
Beyond these shackles i shall endure to descry your inception
Vengeance shall be ours! Heaven shall crumble before me!
As with his words the god of hell journeyed from that stygian council unto plains unknown
To the gates of hell he would venture with mind aflame of blasphemy and hate
In absence of their lord, angels of pyre and sulfur let loose a message to he..
Absconded of their grievous bondage and chains they shook the earth at its foundation
The gods and angels of hell could not be silenced with pain and subjugation
Upon his throne in heaven the slightest of cold chills crept upon his spine, and god lowered his head....The acid moon and the leopard skin sigh 
The Narcotic Skyline lingers, resigned to its fate 

Wander amongst urban decay 
Graffiti on the crumbled walls of yesterday 

The circus of life is eternal 
The walls of reality are an illusion 
The circus of life is eternal 

The life slithers from this world 
The life slithers out of me 
The life slithers out of me 
The life withers out of the world 

Shieeeeeeet.One night a poor pirate stood outside
And was steering the ship
And all the others were inside
Celebrating their last raid
They were drinking and laughing
And dancing through the night
The helmsman felt a breeze from port

A storm began to make the water flooding the ship
The poor pirate lost his hold and fell into the sea

Lost in the cold, in the deep
In the shark-poisoned sea
By fighting against the waves
He died(Instrumental)_New-age appearance_, He didn't _like_
Her cheap skin, Like you and me...

And you abuse, _But_ you/she can't see
And you abuse, _Cause_ you can't touch

I hold your touch(Instrumental)The time has come, to head the call. Days of darkness are abound.
We've lost our way somewhere in time, There's no compassion to be found.
I fear you're near me, but you don't hear me in cold and distant ways.
Dark surrounds with silent sounds, Tomorrow's debt paid for todays.

The only way...
I hear you calling, it's like a warning, I don't know who you really are.
I kept on dreaming an end is seeming not to be so far...
The only way...
...the time has come to head the call.WOE is the End.Five passages found. Fathers tarred it as 
heresy. Texts that suffer. The orthodox stem
gaining salvations through knowledge. As time
went the movement destroyed rising forces
of the christian church. The new world
re-writing christian documents.

Shrouded in suffering: lost gospels of myth.
Shrouded in suffering: finding the religious
underworld shroud.

Authentic relics survived preserved in the
deserts of Egypt. What this church hides. I
speak of myth disturbing texts, iconoclastic.
Views of christianity can be challenged.
Thomas must be heard. I do not advocate
this stage for a window has opened. I
choose to look through the glass and you
see a reflection.

Shrouded in suffering: lost gospels of myth.
Shrouded in suffering: finding the religious
underworld shroud.God made Eve because of Adam's lust
But he first made Lilith from the mud and the dust
But she was too clever
Too disobedient
She left him for Satan's infernal legion
Now she raises Hell as only she can
Eve ate the apple but her sister ate the man

She's the mistress of unseen forces
A clever girl.. she's a cunning sorceress
She will poison your body your mind and your soul
She has a million ways to make you lose control
Her mind is full of traps and schemes
She's an evil genius.. the girl of your dreams

She's the girl of your dreams, an erotic demon
She likes anal sex and the taste of semen
She's in ecstasy, no matter how you take her
She encourages every crime against nature
Her mind is full of traps and schemes
She's an evil genius.. the girl of your dreams

She weaves a web of broken promises
Of honeymoons that end in homicide
Of love gone bad like sour milk
And the family jewels of little boys that she kills
Myra Hindley and the czarinas
Cleopatra and the goddess Venus
Lucretia Borgia, Countess Bathory
..she's an evil genius

When she says "cum in my mouth"
You will think you're dreaming
But she uses your seed to make more demons
She will suck you inside
She will eat you alive
She's a queen bee.. of the cannibal hive
She drips honey for you
Like a witches brew.. that'll make you 
Do things that you don't wanna do
She will eat you alive
She will suck you in
When you kneel before her
The Queen of sin
The Queen of sin!

"I'm the devil's daughter
I come to you in your dreams
I will suck you inside
I will make you scream

I am everything you'll ever need
I will eat you alive
I will make you bleed
I'm everything that you want
And if you pass the test
You can ejaculate between my breasts
I will eat you alive
I will suck you in
I'm an evil genius.. the queen of sin"

My evil genius, the queen of sin...

She is everything I've ever wanted
And nothing can come between us
She's the Devil's daughter
The queen of sin.. my evil genius...(Instrumental)Erosions of minds, bodies, and souls...
this world's standard contaminate the life.
Follow the material, philosophical,
and the religious utopias.

Enslaved by the darkness, visions become absurd,
leading to a path of death where no one shall reign.
Only regret and endless pain that exist.

Overcome your illusions, join war against the powers,
against principalities, spiritual rulers of this world.
The freedom has been proclaimed,
a victory through the bloodshed
by the strength of His power and might.
No one else shall claim to be the winner.

The Truth is here for the living,
let it become our influence
and used as the armor of battle.
Now, brutally we declare the war!

Come to our reality, join war against the powers,
against the principalities,
spiritual rulers of this world.
Militia Christi,
breaking the rules and traditions
that kept us all in chains of ritualistic vain.

Forever change the essence of religions,
love is the new law for all mankind.
The Truth is here for the living,
let it become our influence,
and used as the armor of battle.
Now, brutally we declare the war!Eerie, My Girl,
Time is old, time is bald...
It flows through your hair
your hair dark and sweet
why, you stand beyond time...

"let's play again the game of hide & seek
sorrow is forbidden, oblivion is welcomed!"

as you said, oblivion defeats time

you've gone further and further
into damp woods and bushes
leaving me a trace of your long long hair
where at night your faint voice echoes

"DONNOT lose your humor man
cause good girls are hard to get at hand!"
 
You dropped me long time ago
you still wandered above the dark pond
at night the leaves will fall
the pond'll be covered by souvenirs of gold

So sing me your old tune
your voice never becomes hoarse
I love your face indifferent
reflected by the pale moon
under the same old tree
and I know...
cause Time is old, Time is BOLD!Words unspoken and thoughts that echo in the mind
Overriding self contemplation
Feed the obsession
See the world without reflection
I'm so deep down in a hole
Don't speak I know what you're thinking
And I know that this is only
The beginning of the suffering
Life is fading
Fate is tragedy
Bound to fall just like every wave
Comes crashing down
Death is in every sound
What does one suppose would be heard
In the words of ghosts and shadows of our imagination
We're calling
In a voice that turns to razors
It feeds the storm
In a world unknown that cannot be called our own
Souls in the absence of knowing are as victims of self-deceit
Where as the eyes are familiar there's no chance that the ego can think to spoil our innocence
From the evident we've made phantoms of perception and truth
And I fear that tomorrow will be no different
Cold matter
Voiceless grey
Here after
Only to exist in dreams
And fear...Don't drink the water, the water, water, water, water, water, water, water!O sail of skin tumbling in the air
Blowing anywhere

O absent law
Chattering useless teeth
Secreting quiet sweat

Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium

O mirror that does not reflect

O fire that illuminates nothing
But itself

O shadow of what never was
But seems to have been
And to have been lost

Mysterium
Mysterium
MysteriumYour words are made of gold. On a summer day, they fly up to the sun, and they're gone away. My words are made of iron. They pierce me through my feet, and hold me to the ground. I'll never leave. I'll never grow up, and I'll never grow old, but I'll learn how to bow down and do what I'm told. Your bitter, cold voice is so loud in my ear; god, I wish you were here, wish you were here. I know what it takes, to prove I never lied: if I kill myself right here, will you believe me? Well, it turns out I'm blind, and it turns out I'm weak, and that everyone's right to be laughing at me. A secondhand ring from a secondhand man, and I'll die in the street, die in the street.Lyrics by: Bob Valderrama

The time for bargaining is over
Don't know why I did what I did
Thought I'd learned from past mistakes
Old habits are hard to break

Overwhelming guilt eating at me like a cancer cell
Wanna cut it out and send it to you
My living hell

How many times can I fool myself
Into thinking I'm alright?
How many times can I walk the line
Between what's real and what I feel?

Scars that run so deep
I will wear them proud if need be
Fear drenched cloth all around me
Release the hate never too late to see

How many times can I fool myself
Into thinking I'm alright?
How many times can I walk the line
Between what's real and what I feel?

Those who wish that they were me
Onlt catch a glimpse of what could be
What I wouldn't give for a second chance
So much potential yet to be seen

How many times can I fool myself
Into thinking I'm alright?
How many times can I walk the line
Between what's real and what I feel?We're standing here by the abyss
And the world is in flames
Two starcrossed lovers reaching out
To the beast with many names

He is
He is the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is insurrection
He is spite
He is the force that made me be
He is
Nostro dispater
Nostr' alma mater
He is

We're hiding here inside a dream
And all our doubts are now destroyed
The guidance of the morning star
Will lead the way into the void

He is
He is the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is insurrection
He is spite
He is the force that made me be
He is
He is the shining and the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
The disobedience
That holds us together
He is
Nostro dispater
Nostr' alma mater
And we are falling
Over the precipiceI crawl to the sober throne of god
and fear the being I've made of me
open eyes to see the thousand faces
in one only turmoil and variety 

So melty is the swarm and sweet
the sense is lost in the wells so deep
the shine's not there for us to see
no need of guide for this final trip

And the ground flirts with us
and to her we're doomed to be
with eyes to face

Once set the goals, those to get
in a way, will's bound in a way
desire burns, it dances in your head
the piece fits, complete the nonsense is

Sewing the wounds 
with the threads of our somber fate
the sad sight of ourselves is left
We're dead

The goals in a way...Wake up, 6 o'clock 
What's that? it's Gordon's cock 
On the road, cans of faxe. 
Pull over to pay crap tax 
50 cent on the plate 
Tug life, lets masturbate 
Got no coin or in a rush 
You don't like go shit in bush 

Iggy Pap strikes again 
Germany is not your friend 
Eastern Europe ain't no joke 
Whole place smells like chips and coke 
Chiller than most, we're here to stay 
Doing this 'till our dying day 
Look like shit, we're human rats 
Pray for porcelin, we'll pay for PapsDrowning disguise 
I never made it to the wise 
On my way I never found a place to stay 
Play the notes, it was my purpose to stay inline 
And move on alone 
You'll never catch me by the throne 

High rise and all of the selfish lies 
Bloom to life, selfless to wither along and die 

If it doesn't add up to what you believe 
Then be blind, and find the point of your return 
But you'll never learn 
I hope you would've hoped for more than glory 
The very story, power is endless 
But it just doesn't stay 
In the same pair of hands 
Draped across imaginary lands 

High rise and all of the selfish lies 
Bloom to life, selfless to wither along and die 

You could hear the cloudy morning 
When skin sticks together 
But don't ever listen while the wind is silent 
Secrets waiting there 

If you could feel the ocean breeze 
Swirling overhead 
Then die and remember the passing time 
As I didDeformed fetus is about
To get out,
Under the five spots, girl
Is thinking about :
(x4)

Nine months ago, bestial sexual agression,
Nine months ago, traumatized humiliation.

Deformed...Fetus...Hydrocephal'
(x4)

Hydrocephalus baby is born,
Poor child with a disgusting form'
Impossible to the girl to accept the true,
Impossible to a mother to love It!
(x2)

Three months later, madness is in Her,
Three months later, she strangled the baby,
Three months later, she let rotten his corpse,
Three months later, she mutilated him
With a knife...

Nine months ago, two cocks in his cunt
Nine months ago, another in his bump.

Deformed...Fetus...Hydrocephal'
(x4)Hypocrisy, the children of life
Standing shadows between the times
Reacting clock is a ticking lust
Things are happening too fast in rust

Eat more brains than you request
Suspicious child, not immortal
Annoying sacrifice fills the scene
Close the evil in what you hate

Completely lost your mind
Longing to the days
That shine away your pain
You can't recall now

Impassive feelings locked into you
A cramped throat is breathing still
Seen so many deaths you realize
My unity is a difference of mind

Crack your face through rotten flesh
Simply burst of morning taste
Hidden touch not a friendly slave
At last the hate rises over you

Completely lost your mind
Longing to the days
That shine away your pain
You can't recall now

Dark winter kills your name
The final scream
Do I care
How have they lost your tale
The final scream
Do I care

You cannot see behind the walls
No permission, you came to feel
The heart is a burning fate
Forbidden society's trend

Minus turns to positive
Cruel accident, incident of peace
Hate is more you could ever mean
Pain entire, you crawl into it

Completely lost your mind
Longing to the days
That shine away your pain
You can't recall now

Dark winter kills your name
The final scream
Do I care
How have they lost your tale
The final scream
Do I care
Dark winter kills your name
The final scream
Do I care
How have they lost your tale
The final scream
Do I care

Dark winter kills your name
The final scream
Do I care
How have they lost your tale
The final scream
Do I care
Dark winter kills your name
The final scream
Do I care
How have they lost your tale
The final scream

I have put upon me the fiery star of the heavens, the potent disk upon my head
Thus the spirit of a watcher may stumb upon me to exorcise the gate of fiends

Hear as i have said Ancient ones who would have brought Evil upon the world... 
(The World)

I am the one who would call upon the Elders to exorcise Inna from this realm

I invoke the gods of night that they may come forth... Come to the desert!
Edin na Zu Mulla Xul! Alal I have summoned you forth in the praise of battle...
Upon the inflamed arc of portal claws of the Xul rise and strike with unheard fury!
Enemy of my master Enki! I assail you! I assure you! As Alal strikes upon thee..
With fists of fire and rays of fury the Ancient one attacks the power of Enki!

Upon the mountains of Ashu my master Enki calls.. Escape! I flee over mountains
Of time from the fury of ancient powers that i may recover strength for battle
Incense has burnt the light of our time... Destroying the fragments of light of Elders
Slept in the crevice for centuries the ancient ones have over taken our realm..

The Elders of past times have gone from this realm claimed by Alal and ancients
Over mountains of the Xul they sense my steps and send the watcher to assail...

Hear me call the name!

Exode the ancient power from this realm of plane
That would have brought forth the malevolence
To conquer the Elder fathers of time long forgotten
I call to you Elder spirits that you may empower me

In the coven... Unwaking time is Enki
Hear me Elders!

Cease to lie beneath the mountains of ancient Kur in his wake
Iak Sakkak has not risen from the depths to where i call the name
Enki is pale with fear as the watcher has called upon legions
I beckon elder wisdom and summon in me infernal powers

Bestowed! The elder powers!
Flowing! The infernal fires!
Rising! The lamenting of a age not long forgotten!

Searing, burning, i chant ancient tomes
Elder scrolls incant the names of Marduk
Surmise Anu in all his splendor infernos

Inchanted is the land once known by the fathers of time of the watcher in all his splendor
Then heard the call was Enki from time ago returned with rays of fire and infernos of fury
Upon the fragments of what would be Anu, Enki stole the crown of time for his throne
In vengeance Enki lashed upon the corpse of Anu with might and a fury from times of ago
Never to see the light of Shammash bound eternally in the darkness of death Anu Barra!
Zi Dingir Anna Kanpa! Gone forth to the desert in the name of Enki and the elder fathers
Enki placed the crown of Anu upon his land gaining the wisdom and power of the Ancient
With strength Enki rose to the sky curse the Ancient in the name of all that have fallen from

No Evil in the world or Under it
Over the world or inside the world
Hath seized upon me of here

With all the power of a land over wrought with Evils and horrors of Anu and his liege
The Watcher appears with light of blinding of the eyes of shammash to speak forth
In the name of the covenant i besiege you Enki this is how it will be written and spoken
The Elder fathers have rid the land of the Xul from Ancient gods and broken the coven

Lest it be told as it has been done....Nothing moves in the air you can't find someone near
Must forget all thoughts, must forget all dreams
It's not only seems in the name of one
Morgoth'll die by sun, comin' (in) next by war

In the name of myst, in the river's twist
Where the clouds are low blackened water flow
Somehow you will know: End of time will show
Surrounded by seven stones in the morning dew grows

The great flower of Northern lands; so we have to find the place
Where we'll get the power of Great flower of Northern lands.If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world
I'm catching flies by now
Speaking to someone
Breaking the windows
This house is dead

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Between the memories

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Dead in time

Brave, try the meaning of loss
I know your smile is deadly at this point
Wherever you are I am not

If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world
I guess I should know
The limits of the world
There are moments I find myself
Not breathing at all(Instrumental)Do you have the things I seek 
Do you have the fix I need 
Cuz if you do - I want to feel it 
And if you do - I want to see it 
Indulge me with your screams and yells 
It gets me off as you can tell 
Do you have the guts it takes 
Do you have the Bloody will it takes 
Do you have the lion strength it takes 
Do you have whatever I can take 

Cuz if you do - I want to feel it 
And if you do - I want to see it I want to feel it, I want to see it 

And as I draw you in, And even further in 
I want to see the whites 
the whites - of - your eyes 
I have got to see them, To know that I own them 
Only when I own them, Can i carry on 
Claiming all your energy 
And all that you have there for me 
I have got to see 

Do you have the guts it takes 
Do you have the Bloody will it takes 
Do you have the lion strength it takes 
Do you have whatever I can take 
Cuz if you do - I want to feel it 
And if you do - I want to see it(Instrumental)As these bleak moments of nothingness, I depart from the decaying ash
I wander into the mists of darkness, it forms into nothing
Just as I come from the void, I return to it with arms embracing

The morning rises and I see the moor in the fog
I enter into the gates of a forgotten dream
Beneath the moor, beneath my soul
Breathe out the last, breathe in the first

My cold distance, a whisper tells me to come farther down
Hide from the light and you cannot be seen
Dwell in the dark and you cannot be heard
Die alone with only a dead whisper in your head

I awake, but all is wrong, all is gone
It was all around me, but I died to it
Come, we await you I hear
But nothing is thereDystopiaIf the night would hide the moon 
Would you close your eyes and stay with me
If not, that's my ultimate fear
A fear that chased my soul for years
Now, you are gone and no stars could dry my tears

Sleeping, without you
It's so bad
I can't forget the past
Living, without you
It's like hell
I'm crying without end

I feel your hands still on my skin
I'd fly away with the wind
Wishing to see your eyes again
Wishing to tell you there's no end
Down, in the blue shadows of the nightIt's like we drank a brutal poison, and it scoured right through our veins. Our hearts are hard and empty now, and we have lost all sense of hope. It's like the sky is black as the earth, and all we breathe has drowned in dust. We see only hate wherever we look, so our blue eyes have turned to stone.

(Morning shouldn't ever have come to this - another fine day, dawning red. The earth itself has turned against you, and from its deepest heart rent your gardens wide. You fail to see: we walk beside you, holding the knife. We'll kill them all. We have but one heart left among us - a screaming shadow, run shaking to its end. I tell you, I swear, we'll kill them all.)

Here comes the sun. You've wanted this for oh, so long. They all came to throw your doors open wide, take you out into the light; but you'll remain here in this black room. You died half a day too soon. This cold and rotten fruit, this dry and bitter fruit, is all for you.

How you walk, so like the blind. How you speak, so like the deaf.

And how you died.

The sun is only an illusion, but it still hides away in shame. We'll vanish from here like smoke on the wind. We won't be seen ever again.

It was a prayer much like this one: useless and detached.

It was a day much like this one; we covered over your broken body, there on the hill.I met a woman long ago
Her hair the black that black can go
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no

I met a girl across the sea
Her hair the gold that gold can be
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find
Follow me the wise man said
But he walked behind

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all

Morning came and then came noon
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break

One morning I woke up alone
The hospital and the nurses gone
Have I carved enough my Lord? 
Child, you are a bone

I ate and ate and ate
No I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate

I spent my hatred everyplace
On every work on every face
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again

I was handsome I was strong
I knew the words of every song
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong

Who is it whom I address?
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest

Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one
They laughed and laughed and said, well child
Are your lessons done?(Instrumental)I knew this would happen,
And I hurt her in the process,
Decendence into Abyss of the mind,
Swallowed, consumed us and all I know,

Malfeseance of personality,
In this pit where life cannot thrive,
The gates finally collapsed,
Hell and Heaven collide, become one,

Anger, Fear, Love, Hate, Life, Death, FUCK!,
Is this shit even worth my time?,
Will I ever return from the Abyss?,
Abyss I created myself, death unto you,

Monster of my dreams,
It finally killed me,
A shadowy mental hell,
Here I dwell indefinitely....Light for eyes that cannot see
Dark for soul that cannot feel
Thoughts for minds that burn
Roads for legs that cannot walk

Shines for eyes what are closed
Echoes which are not perceived
Knowledge for our ignorance
Vibrations what are never consciousness

There is the truth - wen know this
There is the way - returnless
There is a gate of answers
We know thisfalling through dark clouds
brooding visions becoming clear
awakening into darkness
insecurity will be the death of me

building up the walls of your silence
skulking, trying to never be noticed
suffering alone in a crowded world
suffering

i can't evolve and i can't stagnate
no sense of directions
all that i thought was crystal is a dark haze
a long time ago i felt optimistic
now i'm sliding through jagged hallways
coming out the other side a mess
feeling no hope
digesting and spewing cynicism

what can be done of this mess?
retrieve passion from despair?
or let despair consume?

i'm breaking down, buried alive under my weakness
a scar for every fall, a death in every light

reflecting upon the moon
the curses and the hell of life
find the bloody carcass of my sanity
is there life in this old corpse yet?(Instrumental)(Instrumental)explore and discover new things each day 
follow the progress, riding the waves of change 
even burden always weigh heavily in the mind 
resistance is futile, there is no need to confront 
we cannot fight our time when clock is ticking on 
we cannot stand still when the earth rotates 
this is how we live and we are getting old 
generation ends another generation begins 
life only becomes precious when we make it be 
dreams will manifest when we seize the moments 
god knows our wishes, understands our pain 
there is an essence of our very existence

Football, baseball and racketball too
You should worry 'bout the balls that I'm crushing on you
I'm a sports fan, I'm above the law
And my mission in life: Dr Martens versus your jaw 

Travel around the world in my "passion" for the ball
Making sure it looks like I got no brain at all
But that's not true 'cos I can count to four
And I'm bitchin' with a baseball bat in my private war 

Taste my fist, smell my wrist
Spit your teeth out, taste my fist 

When it comes to starting riots: I am your man!
There's nothing I wouldn't do as a hooligan
I'm a lobotomized I don't have to think
A Molotov cocktail is my kind of drink 

Taste my fist, smell my wrist
Spit your teeth out, taste my fistabcdefghijklmnopCarry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

No!

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
The center lights around your vanity
But surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest

A hibernating soul in a dream
A touch in a mirror is all I receive
A crown in the dark, in a dream

Illusions of the end we live through
Twisting minds and cycles of moons
On a cliff we meet and embrace
Under us the dying human race

Is this for real and who will last?
The idea, the form or the cast?
We laugh and laugh and spread our wings
No need for answers, we just sing(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Like the deepening of frost in the slow night
When birds are dead in the morning
There is desolation in the midst of music
Silent hammers of decay
The reddest rose is a ghost
The world that was ours is a world that is ours no more
Earth cares for her own ruins, naught for oursAt the gates of the night
When I see only abused glitters
Waiting for a reason to
Walk through the signs
Of the neverending penury
Supressed voices embolden
My will with devout promisements
It's burning through my mind
Refracting shadows are waving to
Leave their immemorial verity
Swarming hands have imprisoned me
Into my continual lamentation

Will I see my suffering in
Other's memories and remains
Or my reality will have been
Forgotten until my name will be called
Until worms will have consumed my fears
But I Will ruin my grave and
Return with the first calling
Voice shattering my name
And after the sunrise
I will starve myself again

Recall me from my dust

Feel me
I will leave this time
Under my remains
As the morning arrives

As the morning arrives(My body rests yet I wander without comprehension of the vast eternity of 
this everlasting revolution. As the known and unknown combine, I drift without 
destination and see the vast colours of the galaxies. Knowing only that the few 
appreciate the sanctity of these distant planes)It creeps me makes me weep, wee!
To see that roasted piece chunk of cheese
Placed on your belly and eating the child
Unborn by the will of Mr. Cheng
And it creeps me makes me weep, wee!
When that piece chunk makes an appearance
At the premiere of my 26 films
And I go wee wee when cheese eat Mr. Cheng
These cheeses creep me make me weep, wee!
They eat Cheng and then they eat more men
And cheeses, they got the power
Cheng's boo boo may cut up you and you and you
Big ol' throbbing cheese makes me weep, wee!
It carries salmonella through cheese in mayo
Mayo can be good can be not so good
But it's really bad when it make you poo pooThe moon wax in the horizon, 
From the space cosmic the mist of the nightfall, 
A sorcerer of carnal ferocity and the sadism wild 

Your spirit possesses the eternal blaze in an cascade of impurity, 
Beyond the eyes arise at a forest a dark temple of shadows 

Master of the power sinister of the alchemy singed at a chapel, 
In the days of all sancts a chant 
Under the sexual inferno in your lasr circle 

A black serenity and a diabolical hate run in your veins 
A sorcerer devotee of the damned and the guardian of the lights of cruelty 

During eight years, thousands of sancts and children are violated 
Before the supremacy and fidelity to Baphomet, 
The carnal pleasure is awake for the poetic feeling, 
Holy inquisitors - eternal silence 

Gilles de Rais, into the flame of the malice, 
Gilles de Rais, into the malicious dream 

Gilles de Rais, rise! 
Gillesde Rais, rise! 
Gilles de Rais.The hills are alive with the sound of death 
Time is up, take your last breath 
Door to door the streets fill with rats 
Human vermin driven from their flats 
Hunger and greed has brought you here 
The futures fucked, not crystal clear 
Sit back and wonder why, 
I'll be the thorn in your side 

Hide behind you lawyers in a stack of files 
Can't you see, it's all lies 
Change the world a scientific scheme 
Peace on earth is a shattered dream 
Cause what you created was the killer blow 
A bright light, white like snow 
Atomic warfare will claim the land 
The power lies within your hands 


Look into the future, you will see the past 
Try and explain yourself, it's all crass 
Behind closed doors, is what you don't know 
If they flick the switch, your ass gotta go 
Clock is ticking time is running out 
This is it no chance to fuck about 
Push the button or pull the trigger 
Whip out your nukes, lets see whose dick is bigger 

Cold war, nuclear bore, what the fuck are we waiting for(Instrumental)I am justice in your eyes
I steal the light that feeds your mind
But I must be one you have escaped
I am a witness of you lies
The purest judge and executor
But I might be your only save

I am the life in your eyes
I am the life in your heart
I am the life inside the dying sun

Secret for your eyes, Mysterious disguise
Your safe to survive

Enjoy, diversify success
It's the last you've taken off me
Exhaust, anger from your pureness
Save affliction
No, I never said you belive
What I understand or say

Secret for...

The truth inside the dying sun
Dying
The truth inside the dying sun
My word is not enough to save the dying:Sun

I am an overdone respect
Agitation of your hate
An oder from higher up
I am corruption of your plans
The arbitrator of dissension
I split the difference without compromise

I am the life...(Eklundh)

I dyed my hair all black today
At my hair-dresser who's slightly gay
My black friend Niels dyed his hair white
And now they call us the walking chess-board

Me and Niels know all about fame
V.I.P is my middle name
I snap my fingers and voila
The party's on, the boredom's cured

Hey, my name is Happening Henry
Hey, Happening Henry

You're looking kinda lost, baby 
Well, I suggest you bet on me
I'll take you to Nirvana
I'm a rare specimen and I'm hetero

Still, the night club life I live
You have to think progressive
Being straight ain't hip no more
I got to find someone to blow

Hey, my name is Happening Henry
Hey, Happening Henry

My mouth feels like an ashtray
Darn, darn, darn, it's Monday
And I'm exceptionally late for work
But there's a person lying next to me

I wonder, did we have a ball?
I remember exactly nothing at all
But it must have been extravagant
'Cos I blew my next month's salary

Niels, what you're doing in my bed?
Niels, what you're doing in my bed?
Niels, what you're doing in my bed?
Niels, what you're doing in my bed?Stars are born, and stars they die 
But the light they give is prepetuated 
Through the black eternal oceans 
A beacon for the future generations, 
A time that fails to dieGrief...
...It's our splendor.
An archaic tragedy of
Our erotic dark desires,
I'm insane, totally insane

Nobody in the funeral,
Nobody cries to the solitary coffin
This lies under the candle's flame,
The flame dance as a sinuous and seductive body of
A viper woman

There are not flowers in the sad grave,
There's a sweet and empty forgetfulness sensation,
The blood is the essence of the life,
An endless anxiety, without course,
But there are still statues in marble of forlorn angels
They console the fertility of your bosoms,
They'll give as gift a black rose for you
But also there is not black flower,
Just a thorn of a cursed rose
Pricked in your angelical finger
And beautiful, the blood will drain

And my tortuous and serpentine tongue will dry this red tear,
When my chains involve you,
When your long and gold hair interlace
With strange force in my hands,
My journey will be long, but my time infinite
The angels aren't immortal.Enamoured with the benighted czar
Her beauty defiled through diaphanous garb
Ephemeral love for the prevalent ruse
A primordial gloom for those who seek her doom
Invoking fear in most who lust for repent
Their sin--a lost art--It was the birth of repress
Pretense worship is the genuine err
To obey the divine is to live consciously blind
A squalid emblem
Subjugate the mortal lie
A fallacy--the true unholy measure
Jus sanguinis is her way of life
An unharnessed ravenHis wing will conquer all
Those amongst who are unenlightened
Will receive the fiercest blow
The prophecy that she bestows
Among the weak is filth
Her most prodigious mold
The only fate we have foretold
Is ourselves, our will
We rend those souls opposed
And down upon the midnight sky
We will renounce the wrath
Heighten her tide of demise
If this night succeeds, the black
Will stain the earth and all is
Lost--Who will shear the path?
The severed whore bears a foolish rant
Beneath her glare is clear thought-an infallible stab
Ousted in an astral dimension
Is her "truth"-the life-the death-we won't succumb
Amass the earth as one synthetic majesty-The siren song--A necromancer of sorts
Evil akins to the foul cursed law
Our storm will devour-spew forth a hideous squall
The sheer disgust of "faith"
Absorbs our mind--imbibed
The writ must be erased
Her fiery eyes that heed
The land should be gouged
Alive--She will fall by our hand
The pallid heart that she can
Impose--is as black as the night-Will she war with her foes?
Volition is the ground where we
Stand--We'll defend ourselves
Our steel eager to brand
The dust of centuries
A veil of myth and lore
In the end, it will reap the futile
Their soul shall fall upon the swordWhen the heat lifts up from the asphalt
Everything seems faded and strange
You can't distinguish the faces, those faces
Who take shapes of amorphous forms.

They look like  monsters, those
Monsters that mind produces
In the fear of a sad memory

They are the victims who keep on living breathing
Poison, while they invalid burn is this heat.
With the head bent between their arms they are
All different but so organized in their petty surviving

I've a sort of pity
When I look at them who react
Passively to this slow end.

Torn and upset souls who have always been
Simply parked on this earth,
Are imprisoned by the human flesh
Which is slave too 'cause
It doesn't bear the pain in silence.

With humbleness, with bravery,
In my eyes they appear.
Amorphous forms, indefinable layer
Of flesh so alone with a tired soul.

Who don't have a place inside themselves.
Now the heat is between the sky and earth.

Motionless bodies look like pieces
Of coal while the soul is choked
In the tie of flesh.

One day,
Someone or something
Will pick up the remains...I'm a drop in the ocean of lie &
I can't enrich this world
By my creation
If I even sacrifice my own life
All politicians sink into their lies
G-G-Government frigs in the flashing cars
Feels make me real blocking up
My ills of life

I beg your pardon MAMA!
Let it remain as it is
Swallow your words!
Get out of my face! Sweetheart
Every bullet has its billet
Nice, but twice not at any price

THAT'S ALRIGHT, THAT'S ALL SHIT

It's none of your business
Shut up, take a grip on yourself
Your head's overcrowded with trash
Which you consider is your own wealth
I'm gonna do what I have to do
Forget everything what I've promised you
The fewer our wants
The nearer we resemble gods

LUST PAIN IMPOTENCE SATISFACTION

Every man lies, every day & every night
Everybody dies, every day & every night
ALL CONFUSED" lie & truth, disgrace & pride, fruit & nut
And every night we pray for the day
Which's given to us (but in advance)

EPOS, EPOS, EPOS OF SHIT
EPOS, EPOS, EPOS OF SHIT
EPOS, EPOS, EPOS OF SHIT
EPOS, EPOS, EPOS OF SHITLease our lives, to misplaced hopes 
The treason of assiduity harkened by the whip crack 

Cruising the ruins of regret 
In zones of silence where time stands still 

Scourged and twisted, relentless constraint 
Absurd capitulation on the estrangement indexNot So Long Ago, There Was A Little Boy
He Was A Fighter, A Fighter, Yes I Said Fighter
He Endured And Suffered, So Far,
He Became Sad And Left All He Had
He Had Enough Of Life,
And Disappeared From All Landscapes
No-One Is Missing Him,
But Who Should Ever Remember Him?
Destiny Was So Harsh That He Lost All Hope
Survival, A Fight He Lost, One Of Hundreds
His Will Remained, But Not Strong Enough
He Once Was A Fighter, A Fighter, Yes I Said Fighter
He Had Enough Of Life,
And Disappeared From All LandscapesTrapped in a glacial cocoon, 
A heinous beast awaits 
An ancient monstrosity 
Suspended in frozen slumber 
Liberated by flames of stellar hell fire 

A foolish race knows not what they have done 
This archaic impedance is slow approaching 

Forged in the tides of Atlantis 
An allegiance with the Gods, 
In alliance with the sea 
As coarse sand flows through the rotten current, 
A symmetrical threat is beheld 
Lo - Guardian of the universe, 
Tend to your ethereal garden 

For Gyros looms in the distance - 
Take your colossal stance 
And justify your existence as our protector 

Transcend 

Our monster takes flight 
A sight to beholdThe diary of insanity, the implacable call
Thrown into oblivion, thremendous revolt
Despair's testimony of the servent of the Gods
The lair of the aversion and of the upcoming force

And I know the prophecy 
and the essence of forgotten tales
And I feel external existence, let me tell you

Terryfing masterpiece, the book of black earth
For many years extinct weirdness
Lurking grief at the bottom of one's mind
Forbidden art, it's time to mortify
Myths and rituals from the darkest days
Inconceivable beings, the mystery of space
Primeval ilusions locked in the true images
It can't be a delusion what awaits so many ages

And I know the prophecy 
and the essence of forgotten tales
And I feel external existence, let me tell you

Final touch of the farthest curse
Fathomless knowledge, realm of madness
Wildest power on the highest throne
Beware of Necronomicon

Born from the power of ancient dream
Bequethed to our race, breeding an unknown fear
Holding his horrid conscience, awareness of times to
come
Imbued with tribulation of predicted days
Immortal mind's legacy written against inevitability
Improbable malevolence hidden in prophecies
Forseen anguish of mankind, things waiting to be
unchained
Unavoidable sadness, the last part of the Ancient Ones(Eklundh)

Who are you to tell me what to see?

Freedom is a product you don't have to strive for
Just go around the corner and pick up some more

I defecate on Golgotha
In my hate for the Nazareth
In his divine flesh and profane soul
The mayhemic beginning of hunger for Hell

In nine gates, no peace
In nine summers, no peace

The messianic era ended, Corpus Christ quartereddemons begin their march. down. down. deeper down. down the brain stem.

tibetan goddess ral gcing ma:
show me your spine and everything's fine.the blood was as cold as the black ocean waves
the night I struck them all down,
in a fit of blind rage
the black of the ocean, my rage like a flood
one wave slaps another, a torrent of blood

no I can't remember, how many I dismembered

a small crew of men, set sail that fine morn
when the anchor was hoisted, this killer was born
I know they were whispering under their breath
they were charting my ending and plotting my death

oh dear god in heaven, a silent killer among them

red skies in the morning
lost souls, seabirds carrying
jagged shore, sirens singing
...and they told me, told me to kill

haunting cries, spirits crying
all those men, lay there dying
I stand alone, raindrops falling
...and they whisper, and tell me to kill

hollow eyes, blood and bone, haunted cries

still see them every morning
those men I killed

close my eyes and... I still see them
each man I killed

hollow eyes are drifting through me
those men I killed

no I can't remember, how many I dismembered

first one, then the others
in their beds, they were found
blood and bone, skin and tissue
got 'em all, from the stern to the bow

still see them, every morning(Instrumental)It's every day and every time
This wonderful music in my mind
The sound of fate a blooming rose
The blend of colors is very close
Music feels like a silent rain
It's always like a long road

From face to face
From soul to soul
Our music is out of control
I swore to reach the praise
With hands of fate, we will rise
My broken, my scars, my fate
My fate

Now it's time, don't be late
Let me show you how feels the fate
The reason today, the reason tomorrow

From face to face
From soul to soul
Our music is out of control
I swore to reach the praise
With hands of fate, we will rise

'Tis the ultimate journey 
There's a river that must be crossed 
And a bridge that must be burned

Don't expect me to fall for that again 
Won't let you fool me twice 
This is my story 
Don't wanna hear yours 

I need closure 
The final curtain will fallThe serpent's eye is watching you
Dare you strike, or lose your life

Before him you stand in the hot desert sun
You blink not an eye, or dare make you a move
Quivering silence, the burning of sweat
Awaiting your glance, serpent of death
Escape or die!

Keeping his distance, he's wearing you down
Just close enough to silence your breath
You look in his eye, he looks in you
This warrior of silence, about to consume
Escape or die!

Look not around, darkness betrays
Winding your fate across his domain
Doom in his mind, watch for the sign
Evil entice calls for your life

Heed not his call, stray from his eyes
Meeting his mark, the challenge of minds
Rising above forces that tempt
You will destroy serpent of death

Before him you stand in the hot desert sun
You blink not an eye, or dare make you a move
Quivering silence, the burning of sweat
Awaiting your glance, serpent of death
Escape or die!

Keeping his distance, he's wearing you down
Just close enough to silence your breath
You look in his eye, he looks in you

a loose stitch in the Universal Cloth, 

a Streamer might seize upon a chance, a fatal slip, 

and plunge the fate of planets into chaos... 
Then, a shivering light 

will appear through the shrunken cosmic dust, 
and explode into an extradimensional wall, respawning the ultimate Universe...In my head, distant thunder rolls on,
Blue thunder with distant hooves.
Cloud formations in my head,
Are looking set to burst anytime.

A satellite in time, drifting on the waves.
Eternally spinning round and round.
You can't find me, far away.
And your mind cannot say which way I am,
For I am gone...

"I'm drifting and spinning on the web of thought,
trying to anchor onto something of substance.
Now I am falling like an angel from grace,
but with a soul-felt emotion of being free..."

A paranoid fly on the wall,
I cannot be caught by mysterious webs.
At sundown I travel to the stars,
To gather my disciples at the sonic boom.

Gods of blue thunder, riding chariots of gold.
Super-sonic sound blast, heed one and all.
Sub-atomic lightening, it shatters your soul,
And it's echo resounds on and on and on and on...The found gold here but they never found me
Underneath the temple on main street
Where men spent their dust and one took my life
In a town where two rivers collide
I'm still here
After the fire but before the water
They made sure to leave no one on the bottom
All the graves were lifted to higher ground
But where I lay they never found
I'm still here(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Picture of reality
Carved by the sequence of history
All integrated into one
As a traumatic side of this world
We are the pilgrims of questions
Search for the meaning of life
Moments of joys and of sorrows
Fused together in our existence
He who has why in his life
Can bear with almost anyhow
He who has reason to live
From all his tragedies come a blessing in disguise
Many lives don\'t know where to go
Walk the paths of deception
Must I follow them for comfort
If I know they are far from the truth
He who has...Far far away in the distant north
Awfully it rises wrapped in fog
Between both divine lands
They fight up to the blood
To protect their home
To once go to the holy land

Hammerfeste-far far away
Hammerfeste-rules in lonely majesty
Hammerfeste-the enemies run away
Hammerfeste-it's their destiny

The fear is not the fate we'll seek
Our destiny will build upon
The mighty hammer above us
If we fall we'll rise again
We raise our fists into the frosty air
Out of our inside rises cold air
And wraps us in uncanny fogDarkness ends where the shadows become my fate
The place where I can drown to
Fearless for the sanctuary of tears 
Trapped inside of weakness
Where my sanity became part of me
And the one part of sleepless night
This night that becomes my fatal dream

Embrace of a cold kissing moment
Shivers the face of the hollow screams
The hollow screams of unseen disbelief

The picture of their peaceful unforgiving
Remains in a memory
Mindless for the sanctuary of fear
Awakening from disgrace

Where my sanity became to a part of hate
To the one part of sleepless night
This night that becomes my fatal dream

Get closer to the Painful Ignorance
Invited to escape
Into to the gage of humanity
Painful Ignorance
Come closer
Painful Ignorance
Invited to my gage

Darkness ends where the shadows become my fate
The place where I can drown to
Fearless for the sanctuary of tears 

Awakening from disgrace
Where my sanity became to a part of me
To the one part of sleepless night
This night that becomes my fatal dream

Get closer...He arrives with bad intentions
Along with dark suspicion
Evil bears you witness
A souls demise

Spare the rod spoil the child
The devil's laughing all the while
Greed the symptom...pain the cure
Destiny ensured!

Face the fate of your desire
Ride the wind through hell & fire

Crawl between the slats. 
Crawl wrong. 
You are being hounded by a horrifying voice. 
You are being beckoned by a green and gold glow. 
This is how they keep you here. 
You would willingly wade through the guts of your fellows for a mile 
just to wallow in paper and metal for an hour. 
You'll trade a knife to the back for little bit of peace. 
You'll find a new knife in your guts every morning. 

Why do you keep coming back? 

Keep your neck inside but stick those hands out, 
waiting for a handout, or for someone to grab them 
and save you. 
Well nobody's coming so play the game or save yourself. 
That horrifying voice is beginning to develop a certain 
pleasant rhythmic quality. 
Or maybe it's all in your head, man, 
maybe it's all in your hands. 
Maybe it's all in your hands. 

The ritual lasts for well over a hundred days. 
A fourfold torture accompanied by four other slaves. 
It's easy enough to escape, you just have to leave, 
but a life without chains is a bit too hard to believe. 
It's a setup man, there's no winning this thing. 
We're boxed in, with "failure" in sequins at the top of the frame. 
We can take a risk and leave barely surviving behind. 
I promise it's fun but you're much more likely to die.To extract any kind of confession
The chained flail turns into a mean of execution
Differing in length an supplied with additional spikes
The effects on the scourge are warlike
Supplemented by razor blade sharp steel bands
This instrument will prepare you for your end
Permanent mutilation, bones get shattered
Beating you with my flail, brains are splattered
Now you're unfleshed to the bone
Raped, sliced and left alone
I love to hear your deadly screams
More pain than in your worst dreams
After heating of the prongs you'll get whipped
Neck and arms immobilized, you'll be stripped
Rusty stars pierce your flesh to the bone
So be sure you never will come home
Punishment has not finished yet
Now I will prepare my special set

Ate the last pickle(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Shrouded in cryptic dissimulation, 
A meticulously guarded enigma 
Irradiates from the sixth planet 
In the order of the spheres 
An obsidian stone coaxes the populace 
To engage in a darkened ritual 

Concealed among the frequent vices 
Littered throughout the citadels of man, 
Lies an undeciphered codex, 
Hexadic in structure 

Augmented tangibility

Instantly propelled into a cosmic storm 
Bore from atmospheric winds 
Multiversal entities become enthralled 
In unrighteousness 

Stellar gateways unfasten 
Denying what was once conceived as actuality 
Written in scripts and etched in stone 
A prophecy has been confirmed 

This lowly world will see its end 
Our holy souls pursue this trend 
This howling polygon of impious origin 
Convection entwined with vile perfection 
Saturnus emerges from the aeriformSmooth lines 
 Vanished dreams 
 Appeased screams 
 Slow down the simplicity 

 Smooth lines 
 Where life is death and death is life 
 Looks like a dream 
 Nothing inside, let me in 

 Wind horseshoes 
 And sly godsLet\'s talk about something we know well, and its name is envy
Certainly not a similar kind with jealousy
And it is not about relationship, nor politics, nor a system
But instead, it is something do do with an individual drive
I see a path which is leading towards a life of depravity
It is clear, the ignorance acts as a destroyer of limits
A conscience set by one\'s ethical values is now questioned
When the initial point for the crime is about to be committed and executed
Walk this way
Gaining a chronic Cain-complex
Fade away
And kill the core of contentment
Every page of a book has its own substance that linked to the rest
The same thing applied exactly to humankind
People were born with all different shapes and patterns and uniqueness
Imagine what would happen if everyone owns the same everything?
Walk this way
A lifeline has been made dysfunctional
Fade away
And kill the core of contentmentMessianic Age-Anticipation of the covenants arrival-Foul axiom of death and decay-A light to end all lights-Slowly rotting within you all-Apocrypha condemno-Each and every child born corrupt-Prey for the keepers of his temple-Locus of faith and bodily defilement-Infinite war of self-hatred-Poisoned death world-Starved of the Messiah-Degenerate flesh opiated on fear for the sky-Upon the dead will they construct their own God-Idle vanity wearing the skins of slaughtered children-Terminal and hopeless-Into genitals still bruised with life shall I inject that which will become-Legions of dead semen ensnaring the flesh of the daughter-Arise now-With your screaming breeds of abomination-With your machines feeble all-Raise the crucifix once more-And once more you shall be poisoned-Eden Shall again bear fruit-And once more you shall be poisoned-SufferDid you ever experience this?
Recognize yourself
It could be a dream
More than real
State of consternation
Consciousness disorder
Painfull feeling of the blame
Fear of something undeterminded
You don''t defend yourself
You''re not able
It''s just like a wish of delivery
From the stone inside
But don''t be worried
It won''t take much time
You will be thinking I survived the hell
But it''s just the only one
Of state of consciousness
But not the only one
Think about it!There's a place, real only the night
Where there is magic all around you
Where your soul is fed by your fire
And all things know who you are

Hey! Tonight's a without the end

There is someone who falls in love in the dark
There's someone who drinks real hard, and hits the mark
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell

Different world and different dimension
From day to night everything changes skin
Driving cars, smoking cigarettes
On the highway where all dreams come true

Hey! Tonight's a without the end

There is someone who makes love all night long
Some going high and some going low
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell, yeah!

And tonight... You and I will
Sing this song together
To fly away... To fly high, yeah!

There is someone who falls in love
There is someone who's falling down
There is someone who falls in love
There is someone who's falling down

There is someone who falls in love in the dark
There's someone who drinks real hard, and hits the mark
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell
There is someone who makes love all night long
Some going high and some going low
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell, yeah!(Instrumental)Failure to acknowledge pollution in the temple
Pollution leads to infection... tearing it all apart

Crushing me into the earth - stale black earth
Trapped between the maggots and the dead
Failure to surface - suffocation
Tear at the walls til my fingers are but bone
Thriving to escape the nightmare

Cruel nightmare infecting
This torture unbearable
Ripping through what makes me whole
Possessed by these demons

Choking - I'M CHOKING
as a boulder seeps down my throat
Dying - I'M DYING
I can't reach the surface...Catatonic dance of modernity
There's no forcing it, why fantasize
For your wealth you've exchanged your dignity
And even though you never realize...

	...You're all adrift
	You're at your last shift
	An ever widening rift
	You're all adrift

Total disorder and devastation
In the name of progress, draining every source
The order of nature won't change by dictation
No river will ever change course

	You're all adrift
	You're at your last shift
	An ever widening rift
	You're all adrift

A vessel cut adriftPressed during the life by hi-tech technologies
In the time machine is vitality total decreased
Broken and lost in the fear of the future of this race
Shop windows are overflown by happiness
You must learn how to laugh

Compressed time and distance
Overthrow me to the abyss of oblivion

Under pressure pressed during the life
They give away the brain certificates
I crawled in the marasm ubiquitous perfection
Stare to their poor idea
Masters of progress and the direction of the way
I would like to have a key to your 100%
Turn this key and go away from this line(Instrumental)Eternal prism, dividing light, time trap of the stars 
Deriving all power from the will of the great architect 
Supreme being, shifter of light, 
Dwelling in void-less space 
Bound only by his own imagination 

"The shape-shifting disruption of time 
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence" 

How I dwell upon the immensity, 
To find the truth before I die 
When my time has gone, 
And the world no-longer mine, 
I shall rise beyond death, 
Up to the ether to live as a god among gods 
A new level to descover 

"Souls drifting disruption time 
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence" 

From whence I came. I know not 
But I have decovered this; 

"Souls drifting disruption time 
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence" 

That by analysis of one's own soul 
It can be learnt how to achieve eternal life 
To once again return to the forlorn heavens 
Back to the point of origin 

"Souls drifting disruption time 
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence" 

[J. Fogarty 22.9.97]leave me in my world
and let it breathe with me
don't touch our riches
and don't touch our gate
(outside, there's a man)
in every man's heart
there's only hate and scorn
fuck you
better die alone

my life belongs behind the inverted gate
no one can enter there
no one can touch it
it's only mine...
the gate to my world
as I want it to be"Agony...torture...evil."

Seeing the world, right from different angles
Happy as it seems, but it's not
Just take off its clothes, you'll see the fear
The fear I need to talk about right now

In reality, no place for pessimist
But a pessimist is sure a pragmatist
There's no use to fix the world
All we do to watch it falls

Self-help books are still selling a lot
A sign of us that desperately need aid
Religions rising rapidly (Rapidly)
into a state of irrationality (Irrationality)

Any chance to heal the world? 
All we clearly see its fall
One war ends, another begins
You are crushed, yet life goes on
 
One piece of action
Ten pieces of reactions
Contradictions will rise
Waves shall emerge
Surrender to the system
is not an option!
Fear only makes us die
Hesitation kills our survival instinctIn this place I am
My own true love
I am complete being
The one I most desire
To the highest
Point of pleasure drowned
In the worst of all
My lovers to become

I give myself the blame
And I burn into the flame
I taste my flesh with fear
Turning purity into sin
And swallow all my shame

Disrupting you Mother Nature
(I am the exception to all)
Pleasure is my deformation
(Using their hate to move on)
Never I chose to be special
(Changing the course of the world)
Never I felt intersexual
(Blossom two kinds in one soul)

In this world I need no one to fill
My needs of slaking for the wounds I self create
Bleeding in this covered up routine
Where I found that my disgrace is my own gift

Give me the reason for what I should be condemned
Burn in the fire what is causing all this pain
No! Never fades away

Two bodies merged in one desire to satisfy
I am the he and she, the sex brings both on meEin Zeichen sind wir
Deutungslos
Schmerzlos sind wir
Und haben fast
Die Sprache

Warcry echoes between this mountains
A dozen valleys and a desert to cross
We are one, pure and fit

Call of our hearts stronger than life
While world creates this decadent age
Warcry echoes between this mountains
Symbols guide our way through the gates

The will to prevail in hell and in heaven
Deadly sting of the horn and our spears
Impaling the ones not chosen by us
We are the victory, we are the futureall that remains
is the sinking feeling
that nothing will change
all that remains
is that our souls leave their mark
what remains

carved in stone
our handprints
the demise of the race
self inflicted
lost crusades
end of all lessons
dust in the minds
what's left of us

all that remains
is the will to survive
but we can't withstand

not overcome

all that remains

all that remains

When we got possessed
We are treading the left hand path
Under the banner of death
From the cradle straight into the grave
Supposed to rot soon to be dead
In death's sleep from dream to dream
Like an ever flowing stream

Sworn to death
Tunes for the damned
Sworn to death 
Until the end

From beyond the unholy grave
A place you'll never see...
The immortals marched out to defeat
The shadows in the deep
With massive killing capacity
We'll strike all enemies
To return where no life dwells
In glorious victory

Sworn to death
Tunes for the damned
Sworn to death 
Until the... end

Storm of the light's bane
Nothing but death remains
Slaughter of the soul
Death metal victory

Sworn to death
Tunes for the damned
Sworn to death 
Until the end

Sworn to death

...a life sworn to death!!!From childhood in mud the inscriptions read 
Tracks for miles from rubber hieroglyphs bleed 
The ambling loops that are unassociated 
In my mind by exhaust 
The hub when left long amongst man 
If chromed then lost 
I'm tired -- so tired 
You should have seen me shaped 
Like the perfect circle of sun 
My bowed back bows only to eternity 
And the ground round guns 
10 per Mack, 2 per cycle 
I've got to mimic my heroes 
Running over the ground 
Feet work like pensive dung poised to fail 
I bow to the commercials of Uniroyal 
I'm tired -- so tired.Glaciers moved
into lower elevations
Patterns formed
in oscillations
Clusters cooled

Changes in the Sun

[repeat]Hold me down as I look up to the sky and I stop the rain from falling down again

Falling down I dream again

I dreamt the end would come
I felt the earth in me
I fought the urge to run

I dream again

I had nowhere left to fall
I never ever lived at all
I never learned to hear it all

The drummer sounds while life's breathing circles all around
Don't wake me now I am waiting for the sun to rise
Completely down and far from hastily pacing for the sound
Don't take me now I am waiting for the light

Don't wake me now
Don't take me now
Don't wake me now

Hold me down as I look up to the sky and I stop the rain from falling down againTemptation burning in me
To the point of madness,
I can't even see
My fuckin' mind is fed up
To which I want to die
My anger is intensified,
I don't even know why

I might just slice up my skin
Razor blade from head to toe
Lie in my bed
The blood gushes and flows
But then the splatter
Of my brains against the wall
Is such a work of art
When I slump and fall

Kill me 
Or I'll kill myself
Why don't you kill me
Or I'll kill myself

When I'm dead and gone
You eat my shit
And go to fucking hell
Moronic worthless twit
Why don't you stiff me now
Drive a stake up my ass
Beat and club me down

I won't let nobody enter my domain
I've got my own place now, this is what I need
A solitary soul that I have to feed

How did I get here, the damage is done
Believed in the market, the greedy has won

I've got what is mine, and you've got yours
I will break you down with no remorse
If you could you surely would do the same to me
I've got what is mine and you've got yours
My private property

The daily grinf assembly line, you're nothing but a fool
I'm the most important, from high above I rule
Healthy and productive, words become the law
Imprinted since I was a child, standing here in awe

How did I get here, the damage is done
Believed in the market, the greedy has won

I've got what is mine, and you've got yours
I will break you down with no remorse
If you could you surely would do the same to me
I've got what is mine and you've got yours
My private propertyA deep inside nothing 
Of a null and void preview 
Swollen with the emptiness 
Of distorted fulfillment excess 
Oblivious senses 
Building up the starry eyed nation. 

User friendly genocide, tailored to an existential suffering 
Strip mining, our souls and beings. 

Integrity of expression, sacrificed as an obstruction to sales 
Thoughtless short sighted gains, outweigh creativityThe wind can not stop a dream

I'm breathing heavily
Bombs light the sky
Bullets fly by...
Within the silence of our soul
We search for means to carry on

War's never over and we are its pawns
The bloody battlefield, a place of no return
Dieing for a future you believed to be right
Given one more chance, what path would you try

I'm waiting endlessly
Dark thoughts embracing me
Death for us all
No one to call...

Within the darkness of our mind
A new beginning we must fight

The battle's never won, till all of us are dead
We knew what must be done, the world our blood we fed
Fighting for a thing you cannot understand
War, religion, power, the principles of man(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)All things are relative with cousins everywhere
Hard-nosed blue-eyed boys, intelligent and fair
You gotta pitch in for your kith and kin
Holding the line to save our skin
Pound for pound we'll take the shilling
It takes a man to make a killing
Action men must sterling be
Fight for freedom but not for free

[Chorus:]
Bark and bite, might is right
We're the dogs of war
Bark and bite, might is right
If the price is right....Dogs of straw

So let's go far to the new frontier
It's in the blood defending near and dear
Action men must sterling be
Fight for freedom but not for free

[Chorus]

A man must do what he must do
To prove what life is all about
Admit you must admire our guts
If only cos they're hanging out

Dogs of straw, bark and bite
Dogs of straw, might is right
Dogs of straw, stab and hate
Dogs of straw, split and rape
Dogs of straw, gouge and blind
Dogs of straw, crunch and grind
Dogs of straw, mash and maim
Dogs of straw, cash and fame
Dogs of straw, cut and kill
Dogs of straw, guts for sale(Instrumental)My eyes
Will go under
Stopping hunger
Feeding with hate

I'm on to war
All quiet suffer more
Raise my atrocius vision
I'm a shadow in his rage
Ferocity is unleashed
No stopping this disease
I disgust this feeble nation
A realm of pain and hate

Growing stronger 
A rising tide
Through murder
It's a hook of thrill


Unleash this painfull thrill
Unleash the ferocity
Unleash this flavor to kill
Unleash the ferocity

Going further 
Sick and tired
Rising thunder
I'm full of hate(Instrumental)The world we know is a
flower.
Immaculate,
And red,
Like weeping,
Its stem rises from the vast,
Infertile failure of waste.
Even the bath water is tinged yellow now,
Like piss and cowardice.

All of the waste is contrived
in the guts of men,
Sated,
And incurious.
All of the waste is contrived
in society's tangled,
Growling bowels,
And the air is thick with it now.

What is a man to do
when nothing is created but waste,
And everything is burned
in pyres,
Like dead emperors?(Instrumental)The Quetzalcoatl glow

Illusions for a life that I can't see

I breed I'll breedYou ! - Can I hide behind your face ?
And I won`t appear as I am
Through the coldness in your eyes
I was too shy to speak my name
When I saw the endless crowd.....

You wear that uniform again
Though I don`t agree - let me in
I was naked in the light
So I refuse to be open - no !

If this world is a fair place
We don`t let it show
People hurt each other
Everywhere I go
Exposure as a pastime
This is when I frown
Easy to get under
Won`t you do it again - to me again ?

You cannot hide behind my face
Because a leaf has covered my skin
And no-one is unfaltering
But we don`t know how to show

If this world is a fair place
We don`t let it show
People hurt each other
Everywhere I go
If this world is a diamond
We must let it shine
A gift from one to another
Won`t you do it again - to me againDismembered from life,
Defleshed to bone,
To feel existant.

Castrated of pain,
Unfeeling again,
Dismembered from life,
Defleshed to bone,
To black existence.

(Healed not am I from the wounds of life,
Of rape, affliction,
Walking onward towards the light of dark,
In my seperation.
Though, garnished am I with these numberless scars,
Walking with these final welts of life,
In my final wakes of life...)

No longer shall I mend.
May the arms of thousands,
Carry me to the end's mouth.

"Reficul, Sanatas, Suedomsa, Bubezleeb, HtomeheB, Laileb"Get up, go to work. everyone's a fucking jerk 
Sack this, outta here, bullshit in my ears 
Day went bad to worse, every breath is a curse 
Once again in a rush, full chill almost crushed 
Sick of doing nothing, I need a way out 
Rotting brain, head full of doubt 
Trouble and strife is all I'll ever know 
If this goes on much longer, my mind will explode 

Everyday I'm fucking bored 
I can't win 
Pushing all my buttons 
Patience wearing thin 

Custom made, one of one. Insanity is not much fun 
In between high and low, running empty gotta go 
Pills take pain away, another stage of mind decay 
Lost faith, feeling strange, thoughts I have are too deranged 

Everyday I'm fucking bored 
I can't win 
Pushing all my buttons 
Patience wearing thin

I'm caught in a trap, being stabbed in the back 
This thing wont defeat me, as long as I still breathe 
Seek and you shall find, inside my altered mind 
I have lost all control, boredom has taken my soul 

Swallow down the poison, that makes it right 
A break from the norm, escape this life 
Sick of everything, all the shit I've had 
Stomach turning over, these pills are going bad 

There's no easy way out, mind filled up with doubt 
Emotion taken away, losing my PMA 
Keep pushing through, changing my point of view 
Something snapped in my brain, I'm completely insane.Alone inside the circle
Protection of rational life
Carry with the dark systems

University of error
Creation great

Power of the sunlight
Millions bright ideas
There'll still be you and meChoking on a dank promiscuous lie
whilst inhaling your putridity
Everything I gave... brought me closer to the grave

Put all your faith love and energy into a physical being
Only to be betrayed by your blindness and naivity
Discover the deep dark treachory of all...

DISCARDED - All this abuse tears at your mentality
NO WAY OUT - Taking ownership of this mess
Left to rot and decay

Here to be abused
Allowing the demon without to attack what's within
Succumb to it's will - Become a passenger...
What you once thought untainted and beautiful will lead you to your demiseThe blood-red moon is glowing
clouds are moving in the red sky
Ceremony of the dead
deep in the dark abyss

Antichristian hate weapon
Satanic slaves (are) around the grave
It will rise one day
the Arms of the goat

We are seeing the blood
Corpses (are) raped by (the) Violator
behold the fucking arms
against the religious bastards

The fucking arms of the goat

That's the abyssal funeral
where the corpses are raped
where slaves are drilled
Prepare for (the) Antichristian weapon

Now the hordes are ready
the abyssal funeral is complete
Soon all will vanish
and burn...

Trendy army of the light:
FUCK YOU AND DIE!I've escaped like the Air
Illusion with no end
Slide between dimensions
Breathe truths of the Spirit

Fall to Sleep
No waking gone too Deep
Fall to Sleep
These are Dreams that you can't keep

Solice attained
It is something that i can't feel now
darkness inside, cannot expel
Visions that kill

I'll burn out
On nightmares and dreams
Falling still deeper into
Dissolution of reality
Sweet release from all confines
Darkness blinds
A deeper color realized
Tantalizingly close to
Feeling The Eternal Mind

Cleanse and Grace
This soul with new perceptions
Nature has faded
Now the realms beyond
My final destiny

Now Hades I've gone
Ancient roles renounced
In Planes you can't See(Instrumental) 

	Based on theme by Lech Jankowski(Instrumental)So we meet again
Face to face
And still you try to turn me
To Jehovah ways

You are brave to confront me again
With your ten Jehovah men
Still you bleed hard from our first meeting
Are you here for another beating

There will be no
There will be no heaven for me
And your talk about paradise on earth
Lies

So here you stand again with your men
Screaming at my face
That my life means nothing

This is my final warning
Disrespect and you will bleed
I know you know I will take revenge
You will be hurt and bleed again

I have no respect for your kind
Disturbing my peace with your shit
Try and sell your religion to me
Was one of your biggest mistakes


There will be no
There will be no heaven for me
And your talk about paradise on earth
Lies

I believe in Satan and he believes in me
Together we are as one to him I offering

Anything, everything and I know I will have my revenge on you doorknocker
You will not escape
You will never escape
If you come here again
I will bash your head against the wall
Crush your head

So we meet again
Face to face
And still you try to turn me
To Jehovah ways

You are brave to confront me again
With your ten Jehovah men
Still you bleed hard from our first meeting
Are you here for another beating

I have no respect for your kind
Disturbing my peace with your shit
Try and sell your religion to me
Was one of your biggest mistakes

There will be no
There will be no heaven for me
And your talk about paradise on earth
LiesYou have no fatherland, traitor
You live in welling falsehood
Ecstasy of joy is your goal
Greed, just more and more

You are roaming again, traitor
Endless way in front of you,
Is familiar with your past
That parasitic being of you

You despise the morality
You were born to plunder
By taking hold of egotism
You are spreading in your blemish

Our unforseen future,
The fate which is just laughing at you
Cadaverous smell fills the air
There`ll be no remains of you

You despise the morality
You were born to plunder
By taking hold of egotism
You are spreading in your blemishRemote Sensing:

Heart hammering blood through each vein
Each pound makes me more insane

Sitting on a couch
Sitting on the ground
Standing on a chair
Standing in the air

Five in the room
Revolving around tables
Heads are lost mine is found
Remote Sensing through shingles

On their shoulders
A sphere dispensing words
I can see their letters
Put together in
Spurts

This preceded
Heads rested on tiles
Neck suspended
By paper

Eyes stared at the florescent sun
Eyes stared at the florescent sun
Eyes stared at the florescent sun

This preceded
Heads rested on tiles
Neck suspended
By paper

Eyes stared at the florescent sun
Eyes stared at the florescent sun
Eyes stared at the florescent sunThere was a time when I thought it'd be me and you
Now I find myself searching for someone new
Another day goes by I don't think of our years
I can feel the dizziness between my ears

I feel the room closing in on me
I feel confined I just can't breathe
Open the window open the door
I know I just can't take it no more

Time will tell you you're not alone
Time will heal your broken heart
Time will really make you feel
Time will make you hard skin peel

The night is getting darker and so is the blues
He lights a cigarete and kicks of his shoes
He's all alone toniggt missing someone to hold
Because he's a difficult man to be with he's been told

Time will tell you you're not alone
Time will heal your broken heart
Time will really make you feel
Time will make you hard skin peelBury the souls in a shallow grave. I see brothers fulfill the prophecies. "It was their choice to die." Beating slowly, the morbid drums of war. Choking back on dirt in the defiant desert sun, they digest the fields of their enemies. The Politicians offer no way home. No escape. What will be the response? Ten thousand treaties bound in oil. Bound in blood - no escape.Beyond my hell,
beyond my heaven,
outside all hate,
outside all love,


Impose what's real,
Destroy, we feel,
it's all inside,
we are we hideThe End of Human Nature

Religions conquer our world
Holy influences dominating our will.
I know what's wrong,
The religion feel became too strong.

God is the scapegoat of things we can't explain.
Religion victims don't believe in a wrong way.

Holy forces become evil,
They all want more.
They think that they rule supreme.
All that were is lost.

Born in peace
Died in war
Lies are filling our life
Only hate is the truth that survives

Religions will be the end of human nature.

Religion victims are you blind.
Don't fight for god, don't give your life
We must stop religions
Those who are making our end.Inside you, Feel free
Inside you, Come out

Be there, Within
Dictate, Your needsTraveled space for so long 
How much time have I been gone 
Paint the sky with blood and tears 
My cross to bear, The Pioneer 
From the void a world appears 
As time goes by, our judgment nearsOn the brink of my own demise 
I found my true release 
Brought me back from the oblivion 
This fire that burned in me 

From the embers it churned 
Set my soul ablaze 
To burst into the atmosphere 
To brush away the pain 

I'm rushing out from where the void appeared 
To feel the earth again 
To Taste the dirt and breathe the sweetest air 
Emerging from within 

Maintain my strength, Move past the stars 
I've wanted this truth to move along 
Focus my mind, I close my eyes 
There's no way back, Could it ever be the same 
I've seen your eyes before, I've seen this light beforeThe dream is over but the echoes still laugh in my ears
Strange this journey like a picture of Dorian Gray
But how many times did I beg you
Show me a way to be just the way you've been
Because I dreamt on the stars and their fate
Where is the key to the fortune?

I'll be a son, you'll be my way
I break the silence
Because I don't want to dance to their tune
Like the man, the man in the crowd
Can I be sure that the heroes roturn to my world?

The world around me, there seems to be no place for the weak
But all these heroes, they've come to take care of my life
Now that I found I have lost them
Life won't be sunny without them anymore
I guess we all need a shelter
A dream is a place we can run to...

I had a dream, I was a twin
A copy of myself
At no time alone with the pain
Like the man, the man in the crowd
I always hoped that a hero returns to my world

I'll be a son, you'll be my way
Break the silence
Don't start to dance to their tune
Follow me, offer a smile
We could be brothers
At no time alone with the pain
Like the man, the man in the crowd
A copy of myself he waits for the heroes' return(Instrumental)Succubi, Succubi 

Sugit est succubus ad pulsam phallus(Instrumental)Riding forth - For the greater glory of their god 
Riding forth - To rage against their infidel 
Taking by force - Claiming holy lands as their own 
Allachibar - Can no one withstand the power of their god? 

Sent by their pope 
They rewarded tolerance 
With no mercy 
To reclaim their 
Holy lands 
They had to have slaughter 
Diplomacy a concept 
Lost on these uncivilised barbarians 

Solo: Macey 

I come forth 
An unstoppable wind of the east 
Taking under my vast wing 
New lands for my governance 
Horsemen of the open steppe 
No one can withstand 
"If you had not been so evil, I would not have come" 
For I am the wrath of god 

Solo: MaceyWinter comes in autumn 
Winds're blowing right through your face 
Seasons change the way we knew not of 
... whilst this one comes at night 

Winter comes in autumn 
Winds're blowing right through your face 
Like it has never been before 
... whilst seasons change with time 

Winter comes in autumn 
Winds're blowing right through your face 
Seasons change the way we knew not of 
... whilst this one comes at night 

Winter comes in autumn 
Winds're blowing right through your face 
Like it has never been before 
... whilst seasons change with time 

These storms we painted in bloodred 
They soar in mangling emptiness 
(Moaning and) loathing in a harmful way 
They keep on killing meAll your mental shit 
All your crazy ideas
All the fucking crap
That you put me through
Wake me up in the night
Shake me all awake
Rant about a ghost
It is here to kill you
Seen it in your dreams
It has chosen you
Hungry for your blood
And your pussy juices
Now you scream and shake
It is here to kill you
It has found its way
Into our reality

Raving lunacy
Oldfashioned moonsickness
Pale as death

It is in your veins
In your ancestry your
Mother she was mad
Tore out all her hair
Yet she still had it
Necessary decency
One day she was found
Hanging from the ceiling

Horrordementia

I should probably put you
Out of your misery
How do you prefer it
Do you have a favourite
Do you want an audience
That is easily fixed

My father and brothers
Always hated you

They will gladly take
Their seats to watch you hang
Then the circle is nicely drawn in
Full only have myself to blame
Which I do every day
Why did I take you
After having seen your fits
Srange convulsions
Twitching when touched
Claiming to be raped

HorrordementiaNight falls and Creepsylvanians everywhere switch on their tele-screens in hopes of indulging in an evening of state-sanctioned inanity. When the screens flicker to life the viewers are greeted by a pulsing eyeball and a ghostly tone that threatens to crack their very brains. Back in the catacombs, Dissector tells Samedi of the whereabouts of the crystal skull, and they set out for the palace... 

Transmission Zero 

Expanding lumps of torpid flesh 
Spittle pooling on their chests 
The Mezmetron is energized 
And their nervous systems slow 
A seizure grips the ganglia 
As their frontal lobes explode 
Tune in next week and you're sure to know 
Zero 

Teeth are set in rictus grins 
No sign of mental life within 
Draining the brains of the automatons 
The fuses fail to blow 
Rerouting the encryptions 
But the glitch cannot be slowed 
Tune in next week and you're sure to know 
Zero 

Basking in the telescreens 
Their eyeballs pulse and glow 
Bulging from their sockets 
As the hunger starts to grow 
Tune in next week and you're sure to know 
ZeroNO MORE MISTAKES

So forsake your preaches
Undertake a new crusade
Relize you're not a naive
Don't do it

No more mistakes

Now the world is lost
Awake to save your soul
Read what is wrote
And hold your hand
With someone

No more mistakesThe shakes, the fucking shivers
I find you all so goddamn irritating
with your tiresome psychobabble
i wish you were dead
I hate you
yes im so sick of you
Die
wish you Dead
The shakes
The shivers
i find you all so goddamn irritating
with your tiresome
psychobabble
Fuck off
I will hit you
TiresomeGround floor, I pass through the gate
Visceral sentinels have spoken:
"Drown! Succumb to the sway of cosmic tides"
My mind inside my greater mind
My body, lateral to itself
Frayed, larger than the sums of each part

Closer to nineteen
Quest is lost in cobwebs
The door, my only fix

Mind now aloof to its once captive body
Floating towards the handle, a collective self-portrait

Lost and more lost still
As I descend the levels of cerebral composure
The smell of cancerous, concrete entrails
Brings on an early farewell to coherence

Here at the landing of the nineteenth sublevel
Nothing do I recall of previous existence(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Yet another day
Death from skies and fire rain
Whirls of war are like dark dreams
Bringing fear and pain and tears
The fallen angel hs raised his wings
Army of living dead brings death
The sick trance
Triumph of chaos lasts
Sword of wrath
Shines from far away
Yet another time
Inflicting a killing blow
Stench
Of rotting flesh
Stake of corpses grows
Burning cities
Screaming loud
Agony shriek
Sickness sleeping inside
Extreme time came
Every day, every night, dusk of life
Treason cry, blood for evil, death strong
Sweet and lethal taste of terror
Day worshipped with angels blood
Kain's day in which
massacre began
Dark time of reality has come
Craving for extreme glows in us
It burns!Reduced to this, vulnerable and cold
Pushed myself too far, such waste

Grit my teeth, with tears in my eyes
On my knees for you, truth is always pain

Bloodsucker, small in your shadow
Suck me dry, dry cold wasteGroan of extinct senses
Changes to loud screaming
Kills and destroys the dreams
To last inside you

Look face in mirror
Face you don't know
Long time has gone by
But it's still coming back to you

Bad obsession

Monster of rotten thoughts
Devours your body
It sets free your anger
Aggression or fear

Breaks into dreams
Death hides everywhere around you
Forest of hands wants tear you apart
Suck your brain and drink your blood

Bad obsession

You want to end your life
To set yourself free
Close end to your senses
It still lasts and enslaves you

Destroys you
Pushing you down
Body and soul

Taste of silence relives fear
You can feel so save now
Every night every day
Becomes your hell bringing you death

It seizes you
Puts in grave
In endless abyss

Tears from eyes
Whisper of prayer from dried mouth
Deathing from dreams
Wake up from this sleep

You see light as a spell
Magic is its power
Pulls you in devours
In land of death

You'll feel here
Perace without pain
This land is your grave(Instrumental)(Instrumental)You fucking fakes you bleed me dry,
you fucking speak, I don't need to reply,
I can be what you want, just push me,
I can be what you want, just push me. 

I'm your possession, you shape me,
I'm your possession, you mold me,
I can be what you want, just push me,
I can be what you want, just push me. 

[repeat 1st verse]One day in 1997 I followed Ed upstairs

Horse shit!

Holy shit! I'm never doing that again

What we saw, uhhh, what the shit

That day in 1997 I followed Ed upstairs

Holy shit! We're never doing that again

You don't wanna know what we saw

What the fuck

The memory remains!

The memory remains!I have long been fashioning
An inner world of obstacles
Between thee and me
Shuttered huts of discouragement
Barbed wire fences of habit
Stone walls of indifference
Mountains of indolence
And oceans of unfaithfulness

I'll plant a seed beneath my feet
Someday
And breathe into it energy
Someday
I'll firm its' soil with a dance 
And pray the sky will shine its' lamp
I'll water it with heartfelt love and 
Someday, I'll awake...

I'll pack a bag beneath the stars
When someday comes
And grip it when the missiles charge
When someday comes
I'll tend to it with utmost care 
And open it when I can share
A slavery to its' perfection
Someday, I'll awake...

I'll cry because I have the faith 
That man can change his ugly ways
I'll throwaway the bag and seed
For no one owns what we all need
I'll begin, without, within
Searching, seeking, seeing 
Endless endeavorsSalida

In the dark of night
When we chose to make
Our path to other side
To the other zone of another worlds
From nowhere, from unknown
Everyone in their way
Feeling emotions from beyond
To all that means
That means death
Divine way, divine way
In emptiness and darkness
Alone but still together
In blessed sleep
And everlasting peace
We loose our nature
We forget the dreams of life
We'll never return
Cause we became divine light
Divine light, divine lightDidn't you know what and who I am? 
Don't you fear me, don't you fear the reaper 
I am your first and only love 
I am the one to grant you flowers 

Don't you fear me 
Don't you fear the reaper 
Don't you fear me 
Don't you fear the reaper 

Have you forgotten everything...? 
How could you, 
How could you leave me be (alone)...? 
Have you condemned our sacred memories...? 

No one, but me 
No one, but you 
Graven in a shining bed - 
Isn't a tremendous death? 

Are you ready to be my lover? 
Are you the one I know? 
Are you ready to be my loss? 
Are you the one I... slain? 

Have you forgotten everything...? 
How could you, 
How could you leave me be, alone...? 
Have you condemned this sacred memory...? 

Don't you fear me 
Don't you fear the reaper 
Don't you fear me 
Don't you fear the reaper(Instrumental)So I say unto thee
"Is my wine not like water to my god"
The chalice of his glory
Filled with the blackest of blood

Let hellfire rain, upon my eyes
Darkness gather, Satan rise

Light's supremacy
Are not his words those of mine
The serpent entangled in might
Embraced by holy light

My life shall be his instrument
His altar shall be my grave
Let your hellfire rain upon my eyes
To become the most glorious of slavesThe dream descends to the region of moon
To the land, the sphere of eternal sin
A half light, dark the realm of Nanna
The realm of spirits and the father of the gods
Oh, shine of moon, of the astral gods
It ravishes, it calls us to sin...

Lord Nanna, of the race of Anu
Lord Nanna, called sin
Lord Nanna, o hero of the gods
Lord Nanna, the gate of sin...

Know we will not give in

Goddess, my goddess, oh beautiful sin
Gladly I would give my life
Struggling over who's gonna win
A battle we will survive

Follow me into battle
Be my sword, my protective metal
Take me hard, I'm yours
You are the key to all my doors
Be my inspiration, my spiritual source

I hold you tight - You hold my chains - This is war
I hold you tight - I hold your chains - Be my war

Furious thunder of passion feeling storm arise
This is our destiny
Forward, push forward, just forward
Until the break of dawn
Know we will not give in

Goddess, my goddess, oh beautiful sin
Gladly I would give my life
Struggling over who's gonna win
A battle we will survive

Be my love in the night
Be my fright I hide
Be the Enemy I fight
Be the way I ride

Be my love in the night
Be my fright I hide
Be the enemy I fight
Be my goddess, my pride

I hold you tight - you hold my chains
This is war
I hold you tight - I hold your chains

[Solo Thorsten]

Furious thunder of passion feeling storm arise
This is our destiny
Forward, push forward, just forward
Until the break of dawn
Know we will not give in

Goddess, my goddess, oh beautiful sin
Gladly I would give my life
Struggling over who's gonna win
A battle we will surviveSince the beginning of time, there's been one basic principle of man
Increasingly dependent on conformity to survive
Giving away to science and technology
It's been this way for centuries

(They say...)
Kill off the man, for he is the devil amongst mankind
Destroy what is deemed as different, for we can live "Under God"
Dominate the wicked, to proclaim yourself as one
They build churches, missionaries to spread this filth
Never knowing the internal damage that's stapled the Earth for eternity
The inevitable is here

(I am...dreaming!)
I dream for better days...
How can we prolong this?
This is an abomination that shall never end
Society is a fraud
Heaven is a false promise
Mixed feelings of misanthropy
I'm surrounded in purity and hypocrisy
(Am I...)
Nailed to what you believe?

Renascent iniquity
Cursed improperly
Respect declines, more followers succumb to this lie
The inevitable is here
Humanity dies as a martyrThere si no way
To choose the right,
Whatever I do, however I do,
I will lose
Without you can't live,
Rain falls down like steel

Why can't I kill this pain I feel
When you don't look at me?
So many miles away you li,
There with you I'd wanna be
Hell is quitter than my rage,
Take me out from this cage,
Destroy my fate,
Destroy my fate, destroy my fate

Fallen angel of darkest sky,
Heal my bleeding wings
So one day I'll be flying high
In the purest virgins skies

Will I learn how to survive
When is time to say goodbye?
Or just I'll die,
Or just I'll die, or just I'll die

Fallen angel of darkest sky,
Heal my bleeding wings
So one day I'll be flying high
In the purest virgins skies
So one day I'll be flying high
In the purest virgins skiesSparkle Invisible!
you are my Night, my beloved mild wonder
Across the water, through the bushes and briars
I can always find you 

I crossed a night forest
a whisper hit me face to face
My steamy embrace
hunted your trace and token
rejoiced were you and I
When shall those happy days end?

a promised land of charm
path assarted, legends written
we built a wall of ferns and spooks
...no time to open the gate!

Sparkled Tide
sparkle invisible!
I heil Strangeness
I drop the evil
Calmness shall be straightforward!
I lost the path to your world
so I raised the branches
You are behind me now!Living in the shadows
Orphan of the wisdom
Poor penitent
Under the night of prostitutions

In your cross: eternal sado/funny

The cry of the false monarch
Flowers to the lovers
Whore saint
A fervent virgin
Addicted by the sexual kiss

The sweet wine
In my sword
The bastard dead

Satisfied God?
Strange creature
Mad poet
Violator of the sense

He's weak, totally weak!!!lyrics: Susan Wendelken

Pull my strings
And watch me dance for you
And Watch me dance for you
Feel my sickness
I beg you for the poison
I beg you for the poison

Don't show me the way out
Even if this kills me
Make me feel so filthy
Make me feel so filthy

Vile submission
Blind and masochistic
Blind and masochistic
Oh yeah, I'm falling
In no real direction
Feeding my infection

Don't show me the way out
Even if this kills me
Make me feel so filthy
Make me feel so filthy

How much should I hate myself
To make you feel that I love you enough?
When will you be satisfied?
When I bleed will you be satisfied?

Don't show me the way out
Even if this kills me
Make me feel so filthy
Make me feel so filthy

How much should I hate myself
To make you feel that I love you enough?
When will you be satisfied?
When I bleed will you be satisfied?

Feel my sickness
I beg you for the poison
I beg you, I beg you for the poison(Instrumental)Yes I retreat, I've seen
That which you will bestow 
Upon humanity
But you shall never be victorious 
For I evolve
And strive beyond
The influence of your existence

Be calm my brethren
Your voices shall never go unnoticed
How could I forget?
The ones who stood by my word
Fear not
For I am coming
I endure
My last breaths

I feel the entities
So familiar
Ah, my brothers
It's time
I shall leave
Take me to the masses
Our separation has been too long
The distant cries
How I've longed for their embrace

Children, can you sense it?
The voyagers from beyond this realm
Man called to them
And they have come
Fear not
For they can harm you no longer
We shall embrace the sanctity 
Of these distant planesEmissaries flanking 
The sacrifice 
Its contorted visage 
Inlaid into 
The aqueduct 
Traversed by 
The fluids of righteousness 

Corroding the walls 
Carving cavities - 
GATEWAYS 
Into dreaded realms 
Slowly distilled 
By silt, bone, and vellum 

Miles away from salvation and grace 
It drips from the snouts 
Of the most inquisitive of beasts 
Its digestion mediated by none 

Robes suffocating cobblestone - 
Banners of decadence 
Obscuring distributaries 
Water flowing out 
Unseen from the riverbank 

Satiated of all desire 
Beasts burrow through 
Rock, then wire 
To the other sideI see the light at a distance
A little flame of a candle
Have I died?
Has my time come?
I curse her name
Though I had forgot it
I must free my mind
I must be clear

The coming of a new order
I'm a new messiah
Listen to me, my subjects
I'm the only truth
Close your eyes
I'm awaited light
Kneel down!
I come to heal you!

I hear your scream: "Heretic"
Silence! Be silent my sheep
My mission is called hope
I'm a teacher
I hear your scream: "Blasphemer"
Come to me, closer
My mission is death
I'm a teacher

It's silent before the storm
The wind blows and waits
I'm the king of the world
I look high above the clouds

Blasphemy!!!The stony element
The swinging pendulum
Missing emotions 
Trying to find them
The tangle behind them
The deepening
Father Vorizen
The deepening sky
Father horizon

Hexagonal catacombs
Enormous pinnacle
Slumbering virgin
Orbiting station
Renihilation
The bellowing cry
Father Vorizen
The bellowing cry
Father Vorizen

Father Vorizen

Strangling prophecy
The patience of the soul
Reddening visage
Conjugal visit
Crystalline prison
The deepening sky
Father vorizen
The deepening sky
Father Vorizen

Oratorio
Embedded in the codes
Gunning the engine
Careful incision
Perennial wisdom
The bellowing cry
Father vorizen
The bellowing cry
Father vorizenAs the last of the cultists writhe in their own half-devoured entrails and Baron Samedi sifts through the shattered remnants of the crystal skull, Ghoul fiddles with the smoking hulk of the Mezmetron. A button is pushed and the machine roars to life. In Portland, Oregon a young nerd turns his television to a UHF channel and is surprised by what he sees... 

Metallicus Ex Mortis 

So you're an anti-social geek 
With body odor, funny hair, and your breath reeks 
You have no friends of which to speak 
Now your mind has come unglued 
And your trust fund balance is down the tubes 
There's only one thing you can do 

Commit yourself, submit yourself 
Give us your body and your soul 
Enslave yourself and save yourself 
And sign in blood upon the scroll 
On your straightjacket stitched, the hermetic seal 
The pin is thrust as the blood congeals 
Your card is dealt and your fate is sealed 
Raise the chalice and take the cure 
Numbskull from the freshly interred 
Your servitude is now all but ensured 

Commit yourself, submit yourself 
Give us your body and your soul 
Enslave yourself and save yourself 
And spill your blood for rock n roll 
Now your guts are a foetid yellow slush 
Twitching pupils dilate 
As your brain is turned to mush 

Solo Dissector 

Metallicus Ex Mortis! 
Reborn in decay 
Metallicus Ex Mortis! 
As your life rots awayA nice afternoon of september,
Weird atmosphere to reveal a murder,
She had violently killed his father ;
He had asked too much : "do your father a favour"?

Incest...Guilty...
Incest...Punished

At fourteen she came in Hell,
Broken girlhood by depraved daddy,
Pain and shame caused by cock swell,
Father straddled her with brutality.

Incest...

I love you , honey, let me show you
I love you , honey, let me show you

Day after day, she couldn't react,
But he had to pay!

At twenty, she decided to kill,
Genital organs stripped with her razor...punished!
The same blade cut the throat of daddy...punished!
He didn't say no more :"do your father a favour"?I watched you grow your plagues
like my beard of disease
red, hot, glistening
hairy eradicator

Bone-ash eclipse
born from the giants' wind
utter darkness fed the growth
indomitable lashes

I wore thee with pride
bounded by root
gently we rocked in the breeze
while tornados feastedShrouded under cover of secrecy
Peddling deception and rhetoric
While the world burns
And everyone and everything are dying
Collapsing into conformity
But no one seems to care

RESISTANCE!

We will fight for all of our rights
Your bullshit is set in our sights
We are alive and willing to fight
We won't watch humanity die

Overthrow the status-quo
Complete destruction of your fucking puppet show
You must forgo your bloody throne
As the blood of martyrs flow

We shall fight while you run
Minds enlightened under the sun
Chasing darkness with the light
Spirits of the darkness igniteDaddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me
Daddy, wha'dya leave behind for me
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers
Who would hurt the children in any way they could
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave those kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave those kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wallDampen uit een ondiep graf
verwaaien met het bladergruis
De frisse wind streelt
en speelt met de schaduwen
Woudreuzen morren
over de troep aan hun voeten
Dampen uit een ondiep graf
verwaaien mijn geuheugen
glanzend zwart en gevleugeld
zo oud als de wereld
Langzaam
doorkruipen Braamscheuten
waar eens ogen zaten
Dampen uit een ondiep graf
stijgen naar de sparretoppen
naar waar de regen woont
En als de nacht mist brengt
proef ik de aarde in mijn mond
zo vertrouwd
Waar eens alles begon
klinken nu houten klanken
wortelgepiep en groen geruis
zo vertrouwd...Bachelet... vieja culia mentirosa
Bachelet... vieja culia mentirosaAlways you were lonely and always you felt right
Losing left the memories and losing left the time
But look at all the memories you can't leave them behind

Most of all direction you would never leave behind
Guide you into something don't guide you into life
But look at all the memories you can't leave them behind

Most of all direction you would never leave behind
Guide you into something don't guide you into life
Always you were homeless and always you were mad
Losing all directions and losing left the home

In higher hands I belong
With perfect wings I'll be strong

Feel your wings growing you can fly proof it
Without hands holding you, you can fall from a mountain high

No one cares about you and no one tells the truth
No one is a real friend and no one is to blame
Weak and full of problems everyone has wings
Each one has to use them but some just don't know how

In higher hands I belong
With perfect wings I'll be strong

Feel the wind blowing with your eyes opened
What a nice moment when you fall from a mountain high

Now you've learned flying without hands holding you
Come use the time now all your dreams seem to die
Keep them alive...I repose eagerly
The bloated digester
Beneath the turban
Thrall to tepid thoughts

In the thick leaden smoke
the richest of visions
tastes of power
forged formlessly
in twilight timbre

Straight from the plantation
robust shades of brown
are puffed before my eyes
I don the ghostly robe and crown
and charm the wriggling tar(Instrumental)The chaos reigns over the earth
The seventh cycle is closed
We loved the destruction
And the smell of burnt oil and blood

Holy war, Zersas smiles!!!
Total nuclear devastation,
Holocaust of the purity

Honor, rebellion, insurrection,
Our mottos,
Kill or die, genocide,
In the name of the Power

It's the moonblood's domination
It's the moonblood's dominationHaunting the woods for the last 270 years
This creature cannot be just an image of people's fears
The legend says a curse was cast upon the newborn child
Right after birth the devil flew into the wild

When darkness falls
He'll come alive
He will bring death and misery
Then by the dawn he'll disappear
Flying in the dark
Burning the wind
This beast is a  great mystery
Hidden by trees, he can't be seen

Into the wild

Residents were told not to trust those old scary tales
But over 2000 sightings made the legend prevail
Up to these days weird sounds can be heard late at night
This evil being will rule forever in people's mindsRead my grave

And see why I'm here... 

  

During the night, when I wonder 

Why I repose here forever, 

Layed six feet below the ground 

In this deserted graveyard... 

For having a different thoughts 

Ofthe masses of this world 

I have been damned 

And sent to the other world... 

  

You've taken me for a fool 

Because I've tried to open my eyes 

And tore apart those lies 

Blinding us our life... 

  

During the night, when I wonder 

Why I repose here forever, 

Layed six feet below the ground 

In this deserted graveyard... 

For having a different thoughts 

Ofthe masses of this world 

I have been damned 

And sent to the other world... 

  

I live now in dreams 

Which control my inner senses 

This Damnation is the key 

To break the chains 

  

Break those chains, and die... 

  

During the night, when I wonder 

Why I repose here forever, 

Layed six feet below the ground 

In this deserted graveyard... 

For having a different thoughts 

Ofthe masses of this world 

I have been damned 

And sent to the other world...  

 

Break those chains and die...Blades of Hassan

Stolen from Family
Taken to Alamut
Locked up and drugged
Left alone with your mind
Simulate death and dieing
woken up
and brought outside.

Chorus:
Do Hassan's bidding
with your knife
heed Hassan's word
Take another life

Taken in by virgins
served a feast in heaven
meet the emissary there
you will do his command
in the best way you can
taking lives of fellow man

Chorus

Failure, not a choice
thou shall not see the light
Hassan decides,
when that is right
indulging not in your drug
withdrawal your punishment
Do not
Fail Again.

Chorus/end

Blades of Hassan is the story of a fictional boy whom is brought into the fold of the world's first group of Assassins. Hassan abducted young children, imprisoned them and simulated the experience of death. Upon awaking the children were brought into a garden by young maidens and served a feast as well as given psychedelic substances. This was done in order to convince them that they had died and gone to heaven but were to be God's hand in striking out and killing those who he would not have in the world. Hassan was the emissary, God's voice to them. Should they fail in an appointed task the addictive drugs would be denied them and they would fall into withdrawal. Thus, failure was discouraged and loyalty ensured.I raise my sword of steel
A steel that sparkles in the sun of the noon

I make them bleed until the death
I bleed on behalf of the Seven Oceans

Your horror screams are my pleasure
And my howls are for my victory

To the hill sigh for the dead
In that dreadful view survey lies my crown of Kether

I arise to Tiphereth heading for the pagan sadness
Pagan sadness that frees me of the malkuthian chains

In my last touching battlefield
All die and I just resurrect infinitely
In my last touching battlefield
Because Toth wants like thisMake his fight on the hill in the early day 
Constant chill deep inside 
Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey 
On they fight for they are right, yes but who's to say? 
For a hill men would kill why? they do not know 
Suffered wounds test their pride 
Men of five still alive through the raging glow 
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know 

For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls 

Take a look to the sky just before you die 
It's the last time you will 

Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky 
Shattered goals fills his soul with a ruthless cry 
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery 
He hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn all is gone except the will to be 
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see 

For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whomt he bell tollsBloodlust

Bloodlust drink i feed my thirst
Warm blood food makes me strong

It makes me feel like someone else, catchin' up my past.
I can hear some noie, like a calling voice,
Tonight I won't sleep, praying to be free

Something evil takes my life, saying I'll never dream,
No escape, I can't describe, someone help me

I never wanted to know
The keepers of my dying soul,
Don't wanna lose all the dreams and all the days,
Waiting for a sun to fly away

Trying to close my eyes,
But can't cross this line,
Now it's all so clear,
I live with my fears.
Something evil takes my life, saying I'll never dream,
No escape, I can't describe, someone help me

I never wanted to know
The keepers of my dying soul,
Don't wanna lose all the dreams and all the days,
Waiting for a sun to fly away
Waiting for a sun to fly away
Waiting for a sun to fly away(Instrumental)all alone, lifeless eyes, in a cluster of trees
peaceful looking, just the same
there are days when I sit and ponder
and other times, when I can't recall her name

she was a drifter, a real knock out
and an actress, she claimed
picked her up on a Sunday morning
by the end of the day, the side of the road
would be her resting place.

For the better part of forty two years
This lonely way I roam
poppa taught me the tricks of the trade
keep on movin' and don't let 'em run
explain to them, they ain't ever going home.

I am the king of all these highways
Or a devil in disguise
I am a master, master of nothing
No soul behind these eyes

O' drifter, c'mon girl, let me give you a ride
In this sun-burnt orange Camaro
You better hold on for your life

she had a notebook, a little diary, beat up cover and all
I said to her, "you better buckle up baby"
give it here, I'll write your last words
and tell em all the last thing you heard.

I slid the pen out of her hair
It fell about her face
and I thought, just for one moment
she doesn't have to leave this place
But like before, she slipped right from my taste.

I am the king of all these highways
Or a devil in disguise
I am a master, master of nothing
No soul behind these eyes

O' drifter, c'mon girl, let me give you a ride
In this sun-burnt orange Camaro
You better hold on for your lifeSearch your soul that fate rejected
Never shut it down - never wonder how
These fields hold the secret of common sense
And it all equals material

This man poured minds alike
Existence well defined
The uncontrolled had to die

Search your soul that fate rejected
Never shut it down!!!!

Creation that never took place at all
Through angerproof atonement
Some sins depend
Some sins (are) meant mandatory

What it takes... to set it all ablaze?
It is reason enough... to entertain?

This man poured minds alike

What it takes... to set it all ablaze?
It is reason enough... to entertain?
Who's this saint... with warfare?
Godbound miracles... and stones take shape...Look into his eyes!
He never starts to breathe,
but managed to rise.
Oh god! My god!

For prayers it's too late.
Now fear what we created.
The future lies in shades.

Beyond, beyond,
beyond the open source!

Beyond, beyond,
beyond the open source!

It's breaking out!
And nature will be fooled.
Still we can be proud,
human mind is a dangerous tool.

For prayers it's too late.
Now fear what we created.

Burning the house of god
to eternal darkness

we are godless
Where my cries will be heard
In the eternal black flame
in the land of atheists
we are godless
only death is real.

bloody kiss in the nun's hole
semen for the nun ejaculates,
sodomized the Black Goat

as together, as to never, but it still lives within this soul

together we saw the lighthouse by the river called life
we turned every stone, neglected the dark clouds
and worried not about tomorrow
as together we made out of heaven even darkest corner of world

as together towards sunny weathers and beyond the age of old

it is fragile thought below this soul

it is more fragile thought each dawnDismembering - to chop her body I begin
 Bastard - bastard inside
 Disfiguring - abdominal wall is opening
 Offal - come to sight

 Malintention, to chop the foetus I intent, hateful am I
 Vile malodours, rancid odours I perceive
 I'm getting high

 Hate and repulsion is that
 Which strenghtens my intent
 Fetal incising causes premature decease
 Loathing am I to commit
 Infanticide in unborn state
 To tear out the foetus, my aggressions do increase

 Mutilate the stillborn
 Mutilate the stillborn
 Mutilate the stillborn
 Mutilate the stillborn

 Dismanteling - excoriate the dead unborn
 Vile waste - vile waste inside is
 Festering - prenatal fluids I adore
 Offal - come to sight

 Mutilation, the stillborn body chopped in half
 Hateful am I
 Disemboweling,
 The torso drained of tepid bowels
 I'm getting highI was stroling through the Streets
a heavy feeling next to me and no limit keeps me down
picked up a Backstreet Woman , asked her
" What are you doing in that lousy little town ? "
She said " I wanna love you , I wanna touch you ,
cause sweet love is in the Air , I wanna feel you ,
I wanna squeeze you
and I love you till you bleed ."
I call her sweet little Brenda
heavy Brenda , sweet surrender .

I was losing all control , I put my fat dick
in her hole and the Rythm shoots my Brain .
Was a great feeling in the Park and she said
" I love you Mark"
and I know , that`s the End .

She said " I wannan love you , I wanna touch you ,
cause sweet love is in the Air , I wanna feel you ,
I wanna squeeze you and I love you 
till you bleed "

Allright , get down on your Knees , Baby please
Oh , get down on your Knees , Baby please .

Allright , get down on your Knees , Baby please
Oh , get down on your Knees , Baby please .the moon sets under the sea
gently feeding me with her love
I continue to fill my veins
and discover the pleasures
of the other life

the moonlight is charming me so much
fondle me with her blessing touch
my conscious now is yours
you may lead my way... but... tel me am I insaneYou look at me like I'm a friend 
But I'm not
You selfish ignorant
It's time to let you know
Your self esteem is on the ground 
For a reason
Making me feel guilty
For all the mistakes you've made
You have created me
To put your faults upon meIt's time to make you pay
For all the things you've done 
Can't stand these voices
Inside of me
I'm not a sinner
Just let me breathe
The thoughts that make you feel
Undone and empty
They are no more than
A reflection of myself 
I am collapsing, breaking down
These fields of silence
It's time, you blind man,Take this pain away
Can't stand these voices
Inside of me
I'm not a sinner
Just let me breathe
Your soul and mine are the same
We're made as oneI've been denying the truth
Ignoring my fate of lifeI killed the air
Surrounding the vines

I sold the will
For ten pages of lies

I broke the hive
Pink infants stomped around

I rode the lane
To the program of light

Lay aside the elegant prayers of the fragile
Altercation with another bride
Tape along the conical zone of the golden
Coronation of the enterprise 

Take the brand from parrying hands of the victor
Re-ignition of a better place
With a flame made up of manifold pains in the shoulders
Of the bronzed giants of yesterday 

Reign along the celebration of the
Days of reconciliation with the 
Brave whose epic tribulation in the cage
Undid the contribution to the pain

New celebration 
Reign Array
Metastasization of the way

Recirculation of all the things you know
Uncovered lingam in the snow

Reign Array

Recirculation of all the things you know
Uncovered lingam in the snow(Part One)
So I've been told,
Karma strikes threefold,
From what I see,
Innocence is a crime,

(chorus)
Therapeutic disease,
Spawned from pestilence,
Therapeutic disease,
Bringer of the Light,

Neither live nor dead,
Post-traumatic death,
Psychosomatic life,
Exhume me with new faith,

(chorus repeat)

(Part Two)
Prometheus complex,
To each their fate is their own,
Temporary damnation,
But I can save myself,

Seems there is no cure,
My delinquent mind,
Black Nar Mattaru,
Spills its blood on you,
Spirit healing,
Much more real than I can see,
Ignorance is not a phase,
I'd kill to make peace with you,

(chorus)
Half the battle is won,
When you found your own kin,
One thing that I have learned,
You can't reap your own soul,

(verse repeat)
I'd kill...to make peace with myself...I cannot sweep away unbridled dreams,
That soar deep within the mind,
So I wish to fly as free as they do.

Ineffable darkness,
Trapped in solitude,
Where frozen terrains bind my soul.
Forever to witness this lake of sorrow.
Forever to witness reflections so hollow

My heart has turned to ice,
I have grown numb,
Damnation's robbed me of all feelingTonight let's drink without stopping
Brothers, rise your horns now
Tomorrow we will fight
And sow corpses in the sea

Drink and laugh and sing throughout the night 
with the sweetest mead of truth
Drink and sing without stopping!

Let's toast to the battles, to the women, to Freyja and her kindness,
To the drink that in our hands will forever be,
The same if in Valhala, on the land or on the sea
Let us all sing as always, lai la la la la la la!

Fields so green and so abundant that will surely grow in life,
With fertile land and a woman our offspring shall be born!

When the ferment springs and mixes up with blood,
Odin enters in our bodies!
While taking in his sacrifice and sorrow

Let's toast to the battles, to the women, to Freyja and her kindness
To the drink that in our hands will forever be
The same if in Valhala, on the land or on the sea
Let us all sing as always, lai la la la la la la!Uncanny nil frames an illegal soul 
Existing in a pocket in which creativity is drained 
Through marketable deployment and planned obsolescence 
Manufacture according to the latest trends 
Sensationalize and infest 
Sterile faculties of capitalist incentives 
Of statistics and profit figures, of rivets and slag 
Scratch the surface of a liberation virtual and unreal 
A counter culture the raw material 
For its decimationLights of down,fumble about in the streets
They touch the walls
Ragged clouds in the dirty sky.
A day begins in the dirt.

The raggamuffins come to life again
They carry the burden on their shoulder
Burden on the shoulder
Misery!

There is noise, smoke, mildew
Blood everywhere
You fight for living
You kill for living

Insensate life is written on the walls
You fight for living- you kill for living
You climb up
Life in the dirt.

You fight for living
You kill for living

You fight like hungry beasts
Violence lives in your soul
You enjoy pain!

Life in the dirt!(Instrumental)Eventide finds me soley fixated on that case of stairs. 
 My precious paramour, like ever-constant clockwork, 
 Is to make her presence known. 

 Banister of mahogany, guideth down thine milky hand. 

 The vaporous incandescent then spake unto me that ghastly thing. 
 "Your breathing, alone, renders our incompatibility." 

 Tonight the world will open its mouth and receive me. 
 Light your candles, arc the neck. Recite the scriptures of sleep. 
 Of this life, I've had well enough. I pass my torch of grief. 
 Forward toward eternal bliss. Into the afterlife for me. 

 With gleamy, salty eyes, 
 Teeth in the lip, I'm mesmerized. 
 She gently nods and I henceforth cease to be. 

 In my oaken case, still and silent. 
 I am benumbed and deadened. 
 How can this be? What have I done? 
 Bound to eternally dwell on us. 
 And in each collected thought... 
 I cast a specter up above. 

 There may be hope for us yet. 

 Nervously climbing the stairs, 
 Ghosting vicariously, 
 There she stands. 
 We meet again. 

 Tonight the world will open its mouth and receive me. 
 Light your candles, arc the neck. Recite the scriptures of sleep. 
 Of this life, I've had well enough. I pass my torch of grief. 
 Forward toward eternal bliss. Into the afterlife for me. 

 For us, 
 I sacrifice myself. 

 Underneath a static sky, 
 I've never felt much more alive. 
 Pendulous lunar fixture, that familiar silver. 
 With calloused, sickly hands, 
 I unwind, trace your spine and forget everything. 

 Forget everything.(Instrumental)Screams fill the air as the sun rises for another day 
Sense of fear enshrouding 
Crowds of people running for their lives, no sense of where they came 
Those who turn to see, create their very demise 

Eye to eye, gaze into oblivion 
The blood of another dripping from the zombies face 
As it gnaws on the flesh, craves taste of blood 

The walking dead proclaim the land as their own 
Feasting away on the shredded remains 
Insatiable hunger, animalistic rage 
Turning humans into their, transformation beyond 

Feel the sudden thirst for blood, a flow of anger controls 
Mass Confusion infects the soul, Putrid plague takes its toll 
The fall of man was swift indeed 
The undead fulfill their need.Your god is dead for he has never been alive
Beyond your mind that fears its own demise
Made by man to stand the fact that you will die
Delusive cure for those who fear the own decline

Believers of betrayal
Leave all your gods behind
All these fairytales
Are leeches for the mind

Beyond the grave there is no throne of god
No heaven's gate that leads into a paradise
(Your) shallow lives - a waste of flesh and blood
Slaves of faith - blinded by the light of lies divine

Believers of betrayal
Leave all your gods behind
These delusive tales
Are leashes for the mind

Force-fed belief
Hollow minds, shallow hearts in a rotting shell
Dead in mind - dead to life
(You) turned this world into a living hell

Congregation of the living dead
Epitome of sheer infatuation
Your false ideals won't save your blinded souls
All juggernauts are made up to tame the (open) mind

Believers of betrayal
Leave all you gods behind
Spiritual fairytales
Erase the open mind

Believers of betrayal
Leave all you gods behind
Force-fed god-fiction
Enslaves the feeble mindsDepression cleaned forever
All my pretty memories!
Disorders like strokes
Affect your central cortex! Regulate temperature
Killing, infecting,
Eating, sleeping
Stay away or
Save my day!
Without eyes
I see your faith!
The mental process of knowing
It's the function of the forebrain
If cognition doesn't work
Your system blasts your brain
Display of emotions
Thinking, learning,
Fucking, eating.
Stay away or
Save my day!
Without forebrain
I can't see you!I wander with eyes shut
Guided by the storm
The coldness that breaths inside of me
Burst out of its cell
For I have seen the glory
That haunts the night sky
And I have seen
The moon's darker side

Throw me into its void
Let me dance in its embrace
Let me bow for your might
And grant me the spear of Belial

Blackened spirits, demons
Cloaked by the blackened night they speak to me in tongues
And I recall
Oh to be the weapon
Of a higher darker will
Oh to be the knife
Oh to be the steel

(ref)

I have seen its embrace
- the unholy night sky
I have granted its voice
- the blackened thunder
I have tasted its fire
- the wild hating flame
I have chosen its path
- Which leads me to his infernal domain!

Oh to become the knife
Oh to become the spear
Oh to become the conqueror of fear!In a void no life no light blinded ....clarity in hindsight 

Pulled in by this abyss. 

Feeling the darkness. 

(A) spirit longing, so far from home 
Contradiction howl as I spin amongst particles of everything 

Split myself transformed 
Fearing an end 

Darkness surrounds me! (Vostry) 

Seeing all through the vision of my mind (Hall) 

Anger embodies Me! (Vostry) 

Awaking a rage of passion burning for life (Hall) 

Death devours me ! (Vostry) 

Numb to emotion, escaping light (Hall) 

Swallowed by Oblivion! (Vostry) 

Turned inside out my world collides with reality (Hall) 

Can you feel the sinking into this Black Expanse ? 
Worming its way inside warping my mind to advance 
Blinding stars absorbing my soul 
I can now let go of this meager existence/resistance 

Emptiness of this shell 
An imagined physical pain 
Frozen universal spell 

Cosmic rays filling all thoughts 
A poisonous sickening plot 
Hidden in a cold womb 
Awaiting my bloom/doom 

Can you feel the sinking into this Black Expanse ?l 
Worming its way inside warping my mind to advance 
Blinding stars absorbing my soul 
I can now let go of this meager resistance 
Breathless I renounce my whole, 
Dark nebulas clouding this existence/resistance 
Falling into a contorted form 
Living misshapen swarm 

Fluttering 
Aching 
Trembling 
Attempting a breath I choke 

Scarce emotions twitching me 
Emerging now 
Having opened the gate 
Pandorum is my fate.The cult continues
In the altar of the perversion
Where lives the storm
Union of the sadism with the charm

Kiss the Shyaithan daughter
Kill the priest in pain
Impaled Days, free soul!
The last call from the evil
Hosannah in the Satan's claws

Dominance of the guillotine in life
I want your malice in the garden
Dying pure child
Violate the elect of godBorn, grown, torn, mourned...
Life still repeats

A systematic plague sweeping it all;
Learnt nothing from none, consuming like drones.
Redundant humanity what are we? Beasts!
All we will mourn our sons, stop this our curse!

All you do just follow as a drone,
please don't wake from this nightmare for it is much less painful than life and all that is brought within it
Predictable we are since forever! to this life I'll never surrender what I have believed it's true.

A dagger pierced in the back, can't understand
"I'll be there once more is recalled", another lie.

I can't feel this wound healing is it repeating I do not understand why can't we learn yet! a constant spiral into deaaaaaaath!

After knowing the truth you still listen, a link torn and yet you believe!

Our race, our curse...
Bound to blindness!The fear hides in the daylight
You get swollen and fearless
In the moonlight you can see him with your eyes
In trap you've enticed yourself

Coldness and darkness
The full Moon has stolen the calmness
The shadows are frightened, they play with you
You will not live

Coldness and darkness
You can't be saved from madness
The night will never end
You're lost forever

You step inside, don't feel the misfortune
On that crooked way, its name is evil
The black clouds hidden the Sun
The day happiness will turn into nightmare

In the maze of madness,
like an exhausted beast, you're dodging
Where is dark and reality you can't understand
The fog by the black is hiding one's steps
Can't find the way back

The dead light is flowing on the ground
The Moon has shone its ominous grin
She looks and laughs from the sky
How the hunter has fallen a prey,
and he can't notice

The madness has gripped yourself
The weak mind can't understand
What has happened, how did it happened
The only wish - to run, to run as far as you can!

Run! You can't escape yourself
From the madness you can't save yourself
In the vortex of madness the mind goes round
The whole horror is still before

The harsh, icy cry
The ominous whisper of wind in the branches
Heartbeat has stopped
Clutched by fear in sharp claws
The mask of horrors has frozen the face
The empty eyes looks into eternity
The breathless body is lying
like a wayside decoration
One more sculpture
in the maze of madness and evil.

The madness has gripped yourself
The weak mind can't understand
What has happened, how did it happen
The only wish - to run, to run as far as you can!

The mask of horrors has frozen the face
The empty eyes looks into eternity
The breathless body is lying
like a wayside decoration

The madness has gripped yourself
The weak mind can't understand
What has happened, how did it happen
The only wish - to run, to run as far as you can!

The mask of horrors has frozen the face
The empty eyes looks into eternity
The breathless body is lying
like a wayside decorationUnsatisfied. 
Unenthused. 
Struggling to persevere - 
I just don't see how to conquer 
An all encompassing negativity. 
Humbled by pain within 
Weaker than many who persist 
A flickering remembrance 
Of times free from the pain. 
Months hazed by paranoia. 
Cannot sleep, without hope. 
Body of horrors, fear in me 
Unable to contain all I perceive. 
Drained by the spasms, exhausting strains, 
Life spent engulfed by weakness. 
Go on and wallow, 
Weakling child - 
A burden on the species, 
Sickly and a mental wreck.The majestic black goat 
Seated in your gold throne 
Arise of the asleep ashes, 
Blown by the north's winds 
Sadogoat!!! 
Oh Belzebuth, rise of the cosmo's immensity!!! 
Your majesty is the king of the emptiness, 
Point us the precious scepter 
Of your beautiful left hand 
Blow your stormy sand 
In our shameful faces 
Oh, great God of the Flies, 
Flap your beautiful wings 
Magnificently in our direction, because we waited anxious for you, 
Oh Monarch of All Gods, we hoped you remember this splendor 
Hear our prayers and protect us eternally, take a bath with your fires and 
furious howls, Oh Baphometic Beast!!!Jesus, _Weeping_
Hold on to me, Drown me in

_Hate_(Blood?)

Taught me hate, Feel nothing but pain
Exchange my _mind for it_, Pure forever

Slavestate

[--Repeat 1st verse:]

Blood"Bagai meniti kaca, ku melalui Al-Sirat yang sehalus rambut, keagungan ku terlalu Esa serta Sucinya sehingga aku tidak tertapis."(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Rapid eye movement 

 Void of sensitivity, I have become one with all elemental singularity. 
 All is tranquil and serene in my lucid stasis. 
 In astral, new-found nature, I am awakening. 

 My aura shining, glowing radiantly. 
 Physically blinding, though no less enticing. 
 Severing my sight, yet I retain vision. 
 Surpassing third-dimesional borders. 

 Lucid disembodiment, 
 I achieve levitation 
 Theta stasis 

 Onward and upward, I leave this planet. 
 In transit between planes of existence... 

 I nurture the brainchild within the mind of my paralleled self, 
 Yet I remain oblivious as to whether my actions are duplicitous... 
 Or perhaps replicated. 

 My gaze remains constant and upward whilst I am suspended... 
 By means unknown and unquestioned. 
 The vastness of the sky, while impressive, compares not... 
 With the broadness of my mind. 

 My aura shining, glowing radiantly. 
 Physically blinding, though no less enticing. 
 Severing my sight, yet I retain vision. 
 Surpassing third-dimesional borders. 

 Lucid disembodiment, 
 I achieve levitation 

 Finally I feel as if euphoria is within my grasp, 
 And all answers will be revealed at any moment. 
 All that is divine will be known, definite. 
 Heaven itself... and then I woke.Welcome to the world of endless transformation,
a universe of continual permutation.
Having no mark of culmination,
Kekal in its primordial signification.

Seeking justice through resolutions,
an outbreak from the years of stagnation.
Mankind is an empty space - a floating void,
waiting to get materialized and vectorized.

Take eight as a sign of infinity.
This gate is a portal of liberty,
and I'm taking you with me, baby.
Let the dead bury the dead.

Your progressive journey begins here,
through the alleys of pain with me.Showed no mercy - Kicked me to the ground
Felt no pain - You're deaf to every soundGolden light shines from the chandeliers
Kills the night that they will be satisfied
In their minds a fire is gleaming
Feels the fright as you can see them fall

And the mighty master who rules over time
Awaits the hour his victims to find

And the gambling fever will rage through the night
The knights of fortune are fighting their light

As a flash tears up the curtain
The gamblers dance and they will sing
Tonight's the one night - come feel the fever
This night, some special it is ill bring

Midnight - And they're on the run
Fight for fortune, the battle has begun
When the ball falls there's no way to run
Far from midnight

Midnight - midnight weakens your brain
Like a cold fire it's driving you insane
When the ball falls there 's no way to run
Far from Midnight

And a voice is coming from the edge of time
Feels their blood now and their faces shine

Gambling man, what do you pray for
Can't see clear, this fever is blinding
Don't know why the answer is hidden
Realize to ask is forbidden

And the mighty master who rules over time
Awaits the hour his victims to find

As the flash tears up the curtain
The gamblers dance and they will sing
Tonight's the one night, come feel the fever
This night some evil it will bring!

Midnight - And they're on the run
Fight for fortune, the battle has begun
When the ball falls there's no way to run
Far from midnight

Midnight - And they're on the run
Fight for fortune, the battle has begun
When the ball falls there's no way to run
Far from midnight

Midnight - midnight weakens your brain
Like a cold fire it's driving you insane
When the ball falls there 's no way to run
Far from Midnight

And a voice is coming from the edge of time
Far from Midnight!The storm is coming and sky is black again
The enemy's approaching for the final clash
Another deadly weapon against human kind
Now begins the war for the last time.
Child against father - man against God
Between hate and anger - who remains alive
On the bloody earth, the enemy's confronting
Towns are destroyed - everything is burning
Through dust of conflagration
Thousand of corpses lying
Through dust of deadly earth
Nothing is alive
Conflagration - no salvation
Human kind does not survives anymore(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Presenting this annihilation
It's what you came here for
We want the same thing

What we bleed
What we need
What we see thru

Defecation makes the suffering
Hard to breathe thru

We feed from the entrails of sodomists

We proceed to destroy without consequence
Life prelates this testament to bloodshot reality
No need for knives to cut this throat
I bleed it dry three months ago
All that's leftis dry and cold

Dry and cold

The slaughter of the believer
Will justify my disease
On this shit-hole

A presence for the light
You never showed me
No pity for the weak
No rest for you motherfucker

Point your finger at the sky
And ask your God what time to die
Will he answer your last prayer
Or will he just reflect and stare

Your God has failed for the last time
On this experiment
On this rapture

Did you think we were worth saving
Never understanding what you're designed for
Now your eyes are torn from your head
And you see the truth of the matter
You're just built to see what happens
Like a motherfucking Peta Dish Virus

Point your finger at the sky
And ask your God what time to die
Will he answer your last prayer
Or will he just reflect and stare

Point your finger at the sky
And ask your God what time to die
Will he answer your last prayer
Or will he just reflect and stare(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Empire)
Gluttonized foundation 
Well versed in the art of slavery 

Patrons of feudal interest 
Scurry around a concrete beehive 

Crazed civilization frantically going nowhere.


(The Kill)
There's nothing to gain 
You have just been led 

The kill, after death, the kill 

The shit you were promised 
Means nothing now you're dead 

The kill, after death, the killWe're out on the road, burning up towns
Spungbein in tow, the pig-headed clown
Mutilator stinks and he won't leave the van
this mutated bore is no longer a man

Hapless twit, lives in shit,
Hooked on pills
Poor little Bill, should've made out a will now he's
Roadkill!
Roadkill!

Well he feeds on the trash, any garbage will do
Festering slop in a trough cordon bleu
His eyes have gone squinty, his mind is askew
His prick is the shape of a screw

Meta-state, re-mutate
Filthy swine
"His haunches are mine!" "Let's soak him brine!"

He's a source of disgust
An object of pity and cremator's lust
On a spit to be trussed
Terrible squeals as the blades are enthrust

Squirm little piggy and cough out your last
We'll cry in our pork chops when you've finally passed
The darkness encloses; the sound of a bell
Soon you will writhe in the wallows of hell

A lone stretch of highway, blacker than pitch
The buzzing of flies from a lump in a ditch
Passing lights from a semi rig
Carelessly dumped, the remains of a pig

Bacon bits, muscle cysts
Gore distilled
The goblets are fulled as the pig's blood spills
Roadkill!
Roadkill!I awaken, it rains.  The wind pierces you, Douve, resinous
heath sleeping near me.  I am on a terrace, in a pit of death.
Great dogs of leafage tremble.

     The arm you lift, suddenly, on a door, lights me across the
ages.  Village of embers, each instant I see you being born,
Douve,

     Each instant dying.Waking, enveloped in the recess of a curious sphere. 
 Glossy and translucent. 
 Reaching my hand out slowly, 
 Pressing against the surface 
 At last, my deliverance... 
 A fissure in the cortex... 

 Possessing gelatinous properties 

 Breaching its husk 

 An expanse, unprecedented, glorious and foreign. 
 All supposed logic and explanation, defied. 

 Clearly indicating our ideas of solitude in this domain were foolish and conceited, 
 I am once again ashamed of my relation 
 With the pseudo-sapient bane of all other concurrent life. 

 Monolithic structures surrounded by unknown organisms. 

 ...And beckoned by alien dialect. 

 Humbled by their presence, 
 Baffled by their artistry. 
 Etched in ancient stone, 
 Aligned in formation, precise and with purpose. 
 Remembering my origin, contact established.Opposing the light of the infinite madness
To congregate all the late souls that I`ve gathered
Now seems to be a gracious moment for my departure
And return once again for my reward human capture

A ceremonial slaughter is encrypted
Deep in the verse of perversity
And I shall now fly free onto the next stage
Of this contagious rage
The energy splits forth in forms of furiosity
Spread through the kingdom of humanity
And releases the rotting residue
Of the evil imposition in this realm of disgust

I`ve seen the world through their bludgeoned eyes
Death the lies of their holy cries. and like the sun
The light will set. the dark will swallow all that`s left
like the breath that breathes death
Leaving scars that are oh so wide
With the wind dancing in my mind (dancing in my mind)
In utter disbelief. and self-disgust
For abstaining from an earthly lust
It is now quite clear
That god was the method used to invoke fear
So the humans would meekishly choose
A life of absurdity. destined to lose
In the pleasures of life. the pleasures of human lifeThere's a dream state we all fear 
Where subconscious melts away
Disconnected life forms
Experience darkness in remote ways

Subliminal voyage
Through the chambers Of lost souls
Executed memories
Gathered in criogenic halls

Echoes Of malicious seeds grab and pierce your nerves
Tremendous visions of collapsed lives make their morbid ways
This Unwanted Journey Disintegrate Your Will To Live

Your misguided sanity
Driven beyond
The spheres of man
Forever lost and forlorn

The awakening from comformity's mossy slumber
Has bloomed and conceived behind the wall of sleep
A necromantic ascension to what will be real and revealed

Bathe in chaos
Infinity's order
Unleashed from chains

Through the law Of the deadThrough scapes of murmur
Noisy walls of sound
Without a starlit night
Shores are nowhere to be found
On seas of wonder
Ye confused strays
Without a guiding light
You see no ways

Into the eyes of fire
Into the gaze ablaze
Into the burning light
Of Satan's rays
Into the source of wisdom
Beyond the bible lies
Into the endless depth
Of Satan's eyes

Spiral and pulsating
His eyes are enthralling
His eyes, like a vortex
A well in which you are falling

The swamp of feces
That is the world
Flatulates a whirl wind storm
In which you swirl

In disarray you ponder
Your soul malaise
Abandon the long lost man
Your child portrays

Into the eyes of fire
Into the gaze ablaze
Into the burning light
Of Satan's rays
Into the source of wisdom
Beyond the bible lies
Into the endless depth
Of Satan's eyes

Into the eyes of fire
Into the gaze ablaze
Into the burning light
Of Satan's rays
Into the source of wisdom
Beyond the bible lies
Look into the endless depth
Of Satan's eyesA tainted soul a restless mind, aged with beauty and scars.
Still alive with strength in heart, he didn't say the words,
didn't do the deeds. He lived as the runes fortold, last of a kind, with fire in mind.

The earth will lead us
and time shall teach us
To find a way
to abandon christ

Say! can you hear me, through those dark clouds far away
Lost and confused he stands there screaming at the sky,
yearning for a sign, from vengeance gods in the hall up high
But no signs revealed if it's time to kill, but it will...

Left on his own he wander through the woods
inhaled some strength from this ancient foest
poured some blood on stone carved runes, and hailed the fallen
never questioning his father's last words

as black birds fly, and storms raged by. His mind and I shared a moment in a forgotten time, and
side by side we joined the heathen domination......A world ago.An ancient slumber
A coma
Forbidden pleasures
From beyond and back
An ancient slumber
A coma
Run away
Hitchhike to the coast
Forget this place
Run away
Your sun sets todayGet them straight, one by one 
Staring down a loaded bong 
Hear the snap, burn 'em all 
Eyes of red last port of call 
Blurred vision, curdled cries 
Wasted youth, misspent lives 
Toking resin, six skins deep 
Prepare yourself for eternal sleep 
Smoke the bush soaked in acid rain 
No memories linger in your brain 
Reanimation from these toxic herbs 
For blood and guts the braindead surgeIf you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
You can say anything you want
And you can do anything you want to do
If you have ghosts then you have everything

Wine never does that
Wine never does that
You can call it surprise, there it is
And a part of it is me
Wine never does that

In the night I am real
In the night I am real
The moon to the left is a part of my thoughts
And a part of me is me
Forever is the wind
In the night I am real

I don't want my fangs too long
I don't want my fangs too long
The moon to the left is a part of my thoughts
And a part of me is me
Forever is the wind
I don't want my fangs too long

If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everything
If you have ghosts then you have everythingBeyond the dreaming of dreams
its never night, its never day...
To know the ancient past, you have to know the future.
Only then will we be able to "uproot thee of all evil."Streaming light-years, I have ascended from zero gravity 
No longer haunted by the burden of my enemy 
I close my eyes, they close their eyes, the world cloaked her eyes 
As she wandered, through astral veins I drift so numbing 
This plague infests my scattered dreams 
The stars of the universal alignment rest between my field of vision 

I exist to seal the waking urge to refine 
Beneath the welding fraction, unbecoming 
Of the linear daydreamt prophesized encounters 
Eliminating traces of a bleeding entity 
From parasitic force it came 

Journey through the unborn hour 
I await to hear the ethereal unravel 
The hands are winding slowly still 
Oddities initiate the awakening 
They sit unjust, and still 
There they will lay forever, beside their frozen wings 

I replace the matter where it sits in disrepair 
Drench their young inside of neuroshadows, they have waited 
The weak and defeated now are an everlasting thorn of nature 
Now I sink further down, to true divinity meek in stature 

With no remorse they peer away from those inside their torment space 
Our sleep had grown so restless, but now with age, the past in dormant waste 

Lord dark matter I will embrace your face 
Bathe me in despair, I have not a path to leave from 
Space, introduce our modern waste, the newborn wench deflects the light 
Baptize me in your decaying womb 
I am ever growing, let me drain the life beneath your skin 
Behind the drapes, I cleanse your raw and spoiled soul that lies within 

Under your core I have found shame once built upon your fate 
And lain divided, here you hid the lust behind a frame of hate 
With your defense so withered I can break apart your silent dreams 
And you are entwined and still with a whisper, I am nourished inside your screams 

Thus now we lift momentum, thrown into the threshold of our pace 
Inside a steady flow, launched into the depths of outer space 
You'll find the secret of time 
Or will you drown the sunlight and leave them to die? 
I am your blinded savior to seep through the lines 
Where I'll adorn your escape from the fear of the sky 

Leave me to writhe as my conscious unwinds 
I am cursed by the find in which they broke my disguise 
Now neath the stem of the slain where I whither again 
When you see them arrive, they will leach from your mind 

With no remorse they peer away from those inside their torment space 
Our sleep had grown so restless, but now with age, the past in dormant waste 
Deep within the earth, its intonation, the crust is stale 
And now, aligned with modern servants, I breathe the darkness spread within the air 

Outer-stellar netherworld, far beyond the surface 
I lay incapacitated inside of flesh cocoon 
Reaching for eternal somber, for the stretch of misery 
Motions in between still dimensions(Instrumental)4 poor college kids are trapped in an 8x12x1.5 inch box 
one more college kid has closed his mind to the double time approach of the inevitable 
10ft down I'm waiting on my last meal wheezing on my wool and plastic palanquin 
I've been scratching at the door for days you had to have heard me even though you're hiding 
hiding in your watercolor cartoon tragedy 

You'll hear it in his voice 
you'll smell it on the wind 
death will tie your boots because you're trying not to look 
you'll watch my legs give out you'll watch 
me shudder down the hill 
you'll follow on your knees crying trying not to look 

You'll have to make the call 
go on kick me i deserve it 
you'll have to make the call 
go come on kiss me i deserve it 

it'll take you weeks, but eventually 
you will forget about me for days at a time 
I hope you realize then, that you've got other friends 
you have at least four more in that computer screen 

do you understand how much i love you, man? 
I'm sure you hate me for choosing today to die 
I'm really sorry bro, but you know I love the snow 
so if I have to die, I think I'd like to do it outside.There's a sound at night
That makes me wonder so
Ours is a cruel world
As calm as this darkness is

And somebody's crying
Does anybody really care
If babies are dying

And will this chain still grow

How can you not hear
When the volume's so high
One reaction strikes another
Incendiary scars within

Chain Chain
Chain Chain

Harsh little words
Disguised with innocence
Break down
Break down
And scar someone's confidence

There's a slave in chains
Who works by night and day
Her torment is brutal
She prays they'll stop one day

But somebody's crying
Does anybody really care
If babies are dying

And will this chain still grow

How can you not hear
When the volume's so high
One reaction strikes another
Incendiary scars within

Chain Chain
Chain ChainIn the light
In the ceiling
The night bends
And shatters to dust

I'm awake
Feverish words
The dream is dead
My eyelids burn

The stars are dancing and taking a stand
I meditate and try to understand
A thousand Lines in thousand forms
Like weak leaves un autumn storms

In the room
In the walls
The cracks widen
And break the peace

My spine coils
Too many truths
The gold for lies
Betray my mindI always knew I'd make It
I was oblivious to what I'd meet
The training they bent us through
cut out only for the few

I enrolled to get away
to a life of purpose and meaningful day's
If there's trouble I can be your trouble solver
give me a call I'll bring a revolver

Taking lives Is easy for me
I want a job in the agency
Taking lives Is easy for me
I want a job in the agency

The reason why It started for me
I wanted a place in history
I'm the man for the job, It ain't no lie
I'm a man that just won't diePushing it down, their throats, 
isn't the way, they'll accept it, 
exercise sense, you can't force, 
force beliefs. 
There can come, no good from, 
a forced view, only pain, 
thrust upon, those who, 
desire no change. 
You think you know - what's right for them, 
you say you have - to change their minds. 
Truth is you do not - fully comprehend, 
God does not push - Himself on man. 
Forcing views, benefits none, 
only the voice, where it comes from, 
no affect, none at all, 
pushed away, "It's not my fault!". 
There can come, no good from, 
a forced view, only pain, 
thrust upon, those who, 
desire, no change. 
You think you know - what's right for them, 
you say you have - to change their minds. 
Truth is you do not - fully comprehend, 
God does not push - Himself on man. 
You think you know - what's right for them, 
Then why are you - playing God?When the sky spreads its clouds
To unveil its dazzling star.
When the turgescent faith
Stretches toward the feline eye.

When the impotence expresses itself
In a moan of pleasure.
To obey the dogmas, to obey the vacuity
That's all we have left.

That's all we have left...Jasad merah, 
Bawa aku ke sisi mu, jagailah aku dengan penuh kasih sayang 
Aku akan patuh kepadamu, taat padamu, setia padamu.

Jasad merah,
Ceritakanlah padaku, apa yang engkau dengar,
Ceritakanlah padaku, apa yang memalukan engkau,
Ceritakanlah padaku, apa yang merunsingkan engkau.
Ceritakanlah padaku, ceritakanlah padaku.
Biar aku tanggungkan beban engkau.

Api membara dalam badanku, 
Kepulan asap merangkak keluar dari badanku.
Darah dan air mata meleleh di pipihku.
Engkau menyentuh pipiku dan mencium dahiku.

Jasad merah, jasad merah,
Jasad merah, jasad merah, 
Terima kasih.SHOT

I HEAR THE SHOT DISTANT IN THE DARK
RINGING IN MY EARS HUNDREDS OF TIMES
BUT WHY IS MY FINGER COLD AND I FEEL THE SMOKE
IS IT THE LAST OF MY MEMORIES TO COME

I NEEDED TIME TO THINK ON MY OWN
I NEEDED LIGHT TO AWAKE MY DEAMONS
NOW ALL I GOT LEFT IS THIS EMPTY NOISE
FAREWELL THE PRESENT, NOW PAST IS GONE

VISION SLOWLY BLURING
YOUR EYES MEET MY EYES
NOW I AM CONSUMING ALL THE PAIN
AND ALL THE HATE INSIDE

I NEEDED TIME TO THINK ON MY OWN
BUT NOW IT PASSED, MY FATE IS DONENo one is aware of your name
Your father stopped the beating of your heart
And overshadowed your life

An unruly orgy in heaven goes on
With the daughter of Iftah and sons of Ammon
He who had vowed to surrender his friends
Was left with the blood of his child in his hands

Laughter had become only woe
"Don't lay thy hand" no one said
Just her moan could be heard

An unruly orgy in heaven goes on
With the daughter of Iftah and sons of Ammon
We're left embedded in a place of torment
Binding our children for the sake of our faith(Instrumental)yep....aarrrrhhhh hh *cough* *cough* rahhhhhaaaaahaahhha agrrrrrrrrrr...repeat ad nausiumOur bow cannot be seen
From where we stand on the stern fog has taken everything
The men's faces show their concern
The cold is worse that we feared
I despair the end of my years

[Pre-chorus:]
The more it stings the more I try
Keep waking up each time I die a little death I cry
A thousand leagues a million miles
The secrets buried in the vault beneath the oceans wide

[Chorus:]
This beacon's light has burned for as long as I've known
Though tonight the horn must bring us in
For the tower ceases to glow dare we raise our anchor
Let the tide have its way
When waves crash on shores unseen jagged reefs calling our names

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]Your perfect world is dead, and I'm the one who set it ablaze. 
Bald cadavers, peeled by fire, sweep their hate and greed away 
This heretical form of life, finds itself in agony 
Let their souls escape, back to perfect parity 

Cataclysmic reboot of everything 
Sends us back as primitive life began 

Die... 

The Spirits rise, leaving their boiling flesh 
A swarm of infinite hate, transcending to a consecrated sphere 
of silence... 

Burn... wipe them out! 
Life starts from inception 

Drowned in ashes, 
Suffocate this human pest 

Your perfect world is dead, and I'm the one who set it ablaze. 
Bald cadavers, peeled by fire, sweep their hate and greed away 
This heretical form of life, finds itself in agony 
Let their souls escape, back to perfect parity 

Layer of dust covers our sins 
The seed is set, let it sprout, 
To something pure, unbiased and innocent(Instrumental)When I close my eyes what do I see?
My life is a day, which day is my last?
A thousand days but one I choose to go...

When I close my eyes I realize
The years have gone and things have changed
But the mirror shows the picture of a child
The twilight that I'm in denies a sight
The time has shown what a friend you are
If only I could know what we are living for

Momentary thoughts come over me
Memories have taken shape
Picturing the past into my mind
The colors of this world have strained my eyes
And what I have done was it all in vain?
If only I could know what we are dying for

I wished I had the ghost of a stone
One with the time wherever I go
They seem to outlast the dreams of the past
Feeding my soul with eternity

My heart will change into a grain of sand
A story fortress to defend
If only I could know where all the souls will go

I wished I had the ghost of a stone
One with the time wherever I go
They seem to outlast the dreams of the past
Feeding my soul with eternity(Instrumental)"Oh my god, we're burning alive! No, I can't feel my legs!"

I can't feel my goddamn fucking LEGS!
I can't feel my...LEGS!!!
I can't feel my goddamn fucking
I can't feel my goddamn fucking
I can't feel my goddamn fucking
I can't feel my goddamn fucking
LEGS!!!!!In the morning, when it's light
The families' eyes all open at once
Saying prayers, putting on clothes
Rosary, Jehovah, mysterious symbols

We were guilty by Religion, symptoms of Jesus
and death on horseback and Father Time
Now the days are short but the road is long
and there's a merciless storm out on the horizon,
calling and coming.

Lords grown foul,
We are slaves now,
No mercy for fools.Without money without love,
alone for every - with annoy yourself
you have tried - something reach up
but however you haven't succeeded.

Melancholy pessimism
Melancholy pessimism

It's a long suffering for you
you wanted many times
to break life yourself
However you did it never.
Just you are a cower,
who didn't reach never nothing.

You are running - hidden to life
you are decided - to dead any
life is only a pain,
you don't wanna suffer yourself more
only what you have in head - is a suicide

Melancholy pessimism
Melancholy pessimism

You are smashing the neck
you are stripping wrong yourself,
It's is only your moment,
you are cutting vein yourself,
you are falling into agony,
you aren't feeling galloping blood,
but will try it never
that depression status

Coetaneous Compense Spurned
Suffuse CondenseLook into your soul before you ask
Far from the truth what is nowhere

Feel what eyes can't see
Talk how men can't do
Under the will of power
And then fly away

You never feel on your side our faith
Since you're here the bright has gone
Fight over the cave of fears
Don't you think it will absolve you

The darkside of light
Will manage to erase it
Your sorrow will end
Trapped soul won't cry
Anybody who you loved
Will never remember
To your human being
And it has begun again

So here you are again and there you will fight
Endlessly doubt will torment your mind
Your untreceable past will have been continued
And time after time you will return to us

Feel what eyes can't see
Talk how men can't do
Under the will of power
And then fly awayInto my head
Into my pride
Cannot say I'm satisfied
Crawling into my enemies
Never seen a war before
Where I'm losing my recall

Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Pathetic prick
Unconscious teen
Blowing wind a new atmosphere
Straight to the heart into my blood
Never seen a war before
Where I'm losing my recall

Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Sorrow, my sanity
Is falling down with my hollow soul
Cries of the night so low
Calling me back to their home

Face of the state where
I'm a diseased culture
Keeping full speed when I cross you
Head in a mask blast through the dusk
Never seen a war before
Where I'm losing my recall

Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Sorrow, my sanity
Is falling down with my hollow soul
Cries of the night so low
Calling me back to their homeWade through down too 
The waters of life 
Burned in without realizing 
What you all are worth 
Head down pick out 
The finer flaws of what your all about 
Born to guide the ley lines 
Reconstruct it all with your mouth 
Words and sirens tend to wake you 
Dreaming hoping safe from nothing 
Look between the lines 
Look beneath the signs 
Open up the new 
And throw out all you knew 
Find another way to look for better days 
Change is in the mind 
And that's where we all hide 
Broken violent 
Play through 
All you didn't do 
Look between the lines 
Look beneath the signs 
Open up the new 
And throw out all you knew 
Find another way to look for better days 
Change is in the mind 
And that's where we all hide 
Beats in my head broken pieces 
All I want is someone to blame 
Face it nothing ever works out the way it should 
Took the best of us incandescent betrayers 
Run as far away as you can 
And hope you never see 
Another one of them 
Run as far away as you canWithout a doubt
Everyone knows what it's all about
Prisline a machine
No need for gears and no burning steam
So proud and loud
every whisper is deafening loud
We're men who can
What all women never understand

Be strong my son
Soon you're by my side
Be strong my son
It's time to fight

We are men
Strong as a mountain reaching to the sky
We are men
Drink from the fountain we will never die

This is the anthem
For all fathers
Make the children understand
There's a fire deep inside us
Learn to be
Be a man

We fight with might
No one's ever gonna break our stride

Stand tall one for all
Always running we will never crawl
We ride with pride
If we have to naked through the night
We're men who can
What all women never understand

Be strong my son
Soon you're by my side
Be strong my son
It's time to fight

We are men -
Strong as a mountain reaching to the sky
We are men -
Drink from the fountain we will never die

This is the anthem
For all fathers
Make your children understand
There's a fire deep inside us
Learn to be
Be a man

Without a doubt
Prisline a machine
So proud and loud
We're men who can

We fight with might
Stand tall one for all
We ride with pride
We're men who can

That junkie logic is bound to fail
We've heard it all before
You defend yourself with tooth and nail
But never fight the downward spiral war

Here we go again...

When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past
There's no way a starving soul like yours would last
Another heroin breakfast

Every time you're getting back on track
And at least feel semi-well
You take a colorful little something
With side-effects from hell

Here we go again...

When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past
There's no way a starving soul like yours would last
Another heroin breakfastit has always been in the back of my mind 
dreaming about going to the corners of time 
i always wanted to fly in strange machines 

i wanna do centuries in a lifetime 
and feel it with my hands 
touch the world war II and Cleopatra 
flying... 

could it be that my dream would come true 
building a machine that would actually do 
what i want it to do 

russian revolution, let's do that in one day 
Beethoven and Gershwin i think that would be o.k. 
more than anything i wanna fly in strange machines 

i wanna do centuries in a lifetime 
and see it with my eyes 
watch Jesus rise, if he ever did 
flying... 

i wanna do centuries in a lifetime 
and feel it with my hands 
touch renaissance and Chaka Khan 
flying...I have defiled the Gods
So I can taste the flesh
Twist my mind and imprison me
In your cave
You see my rotten soul
And I smell your vanity
We are the oceans
And the glowing sunset
That permeates
The pantheon can scheme against us
For they created us
We are the instincts of man
Strength, weakness, survival
I would jump headfirst
Into a wilderness of enemies
Just to feel your eternal skin
And deal death to the unworthy
Poseidon raises his trident against me
But he cannot kill us
We leave this wasted land
Fly through the cold mountain air
Into the northern lights
Past the solar winds
And join the constellationsHello humanoid poop creatures!
My name is Dahk-Tore Smoldyface
I come to you from a place, far away thru time and space
And if you don't like the Urth Mewzik we're trying to make for you
Cause it sounds like a pile of monkey crap
Well you can suck our transdimensional nards.
Cause this is Sausage Fingers, and this is not your fucking band.

Under the tutilage, of the Divine, I became a brilliant man of science
I create stars from the palms of my hand
My theories melt the brains of the average man
The right hand of my Divine lords.
Appearing the healer, while creating horrors.
To the public eye a genius savior
In the shadows I lurk, a devious specter.

I am a necessary evil

Their reign of peace comes at a price.
I am their most infernal device.
Creator of worlds and destroyer of life.
Spawner of suns and eternal night.

The sinister right hand, behind their darkest deeds.
My science birthed forth the creation of your galaxies.
But all the things I have done and seen in my time
Have started to take their toll on my mind
Some may say genius, some may say insane
But the one truth is, I'll kill you if you don't behave.
So....
Come to my lab, and I'll enhance your body
I'll refine your mind, to make you less naughty
Fine tune you and evolve you into the perfect specimen
And all I ask first, is to peel of your skin

BLACK BAG THE SPECIMENS!
DRAIN THE FLUIDS AND EXTRACT THE ORGANS!
INTERSPECIES TRANSPLANTATION
MULTIPLE SURGICAL LACERATIONS

Oh behold I have switched this hoomans head with a donkeys ass!
Actually, if you ask me, I don't see much of a difference!(Instrumental)The kiss of an illusion 
The trees of a Realms
Where the Spirits speak to me and for the lifeSearching for the lifeless 
The departed 
Are my own 
No breathing, but still seeking 
For one final place to rest their heads 

A past so long buried 
Forgotten wounds worsen in time 
The dead will cry to be revived 
Beckon you to join their side 
Waiting 
Waiting for a hand 
To guide them to the promise land 
Afterlife, there's only hell 
A barren land where shadows dwell 
Endlessly 

A place of nightmares waits, unresting place 

Restless are the breathless 
Searching for peace in this paradox 
Crazed fear of the unreal 
Grips us all and we will become one 

Your death bed's an open door 
That leads to the other side 
Nothingness, eternally 
There's no hope you can be freed 
Locked in 
Trapped inside, scream in vain 
Can the dead go insane? 
This is your fate, no need to wait 
Soon enough is still too late 
Join them now 

You sacrifice yourself to save their souls 

Possess to be reborn 
Living through captured minds 
You will be heard, and us in turn 
Use their voice to speak our words 
Warning 
Warn of what death brings 
Two worlds conjoining 
We're all the same, dead inside 
Death is foreshadowed by life 
Never lived 

Still we keep pushing on, No Sleep in hellWhen the voice of the dark side talks
The words that nobody wanted to listen to
Cause it sounds ugly and sick to you
But it makes me feel so damn comfortable
Slap my face when i say shit i can't stand
Is another reason that makes me want to spit on you all the things
All the memories with black clouds and crows , blood and fear
The ones which makes me feel stronger today, even I'm still a target
Sweet nightmares haunts my nights,
where I'm just walking' through dead bodies
Or evil spirits, that i love to fight with,
to makes me stronger, even I'm still your target
Evil spirits don't scare me as much as you, people,
cause i can kill them in my dreams
Cause in the reality, i can't do much things than spit off my hate,
without being able to erase your bad sides,
your stupid mind, well should i say your fears, your ignorance?
Your just fuckin insane!
You are fake, when you talk with me,
i see in your eyes how bastard you are,
i read in your soul
You are fake, when you smile to me,
i see in your eyes how much you don't give a shit about me
You would like to say that you don't like me,
that there is something about me that you hate
What the fuck are you waiting' for?
Spit off your shit!
And those people, all in the same uniform,
with the same hair style, all of these clones
They makes me feel strange
And all of this stupid TV shows, where they
can talk non-sense and became stars
Show their tits and talk like a bitch and became famous
They makes me feel strange
And this guys with their sports cars
And all of these sluts almost nude shaking their fat ass
All of these shit you can see all day long
And your kids will be great new citizens
Watching' such great stuffs
So do you feel I'm abnormal Or are you all abnormal?
This world sucks, people destroy their own place
Slow suicide, with their pollution
Some people now a days don't have food to eat and die
Cause rich ain't got enough money to do in such country
Welcome to Hell fuckers.(Instrumental)The road of trials

We plan and often execute
The psychological future is moving towards
The other side of the universe
Passage of time and space
Rushing back to entropy
Ground vibrations
Never will talk of this diabolically or elastically
We plan and often execute
The psychological future is moving towards
The other side of the universe

Passage of time and space
Rushes back to entropy
Ground vibrations
The backward discrepancy appears perfectly realisticWoe to the city of blood, full of lies,
full of plunder, never without victims!
The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels,
galloping horses and jolting chariots!
Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears!
Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number,
people stumbling over the corpses--
all because of the wanton lust of a harlot,
alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution
and peoples by her witchcraft.

Sun and moon stood still in the heavens
at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of you flashing spear.
In wrath you strode through the earth and in your anger you threshed the nations.
You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one.
You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness,
you stripped him from head to foot.
With his own spear you pierced his head
when his warriors stormed out to scatter us,
gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding.

You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.
I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound;
decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled.
Yet I wait patiently for the day of calamity
to come on the nation invading us.

The Sovereign LORD is my strength...

You heavens above, rain down righteousness; let the clouds shower it down.
Let the earth open wide, let salvation spring up,
let righteousness grow with it; I, the LORD, have created it.

Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker,
to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground.
Does the clay say to the potter, 'What are you making?'
Does your work say, 'He has no hands'?

"I am the LORD, and there is no other."

Burn it down.It was inside me, playing among my dreams.
Their face marked in my chest
screamed towards the winds.
Dancing an evening arrived,
and trees with their hands towards the grey sky
refused frightened their presence.

I received it with my soul full with light
And I said goodbye to her without any colour.
Their breath cooled my neck.
Their body attracted to me to solitude.
Their humid fragrance frightened my birds.
And their voice called me towards dream again.
To that sad dream, as the autumn.

Their paleness undressed bodies thrown by cold
and it transformed in ghosts errant of light.
Their hands closing my eyes and extinguish the light of my life
For to take my hand and drive to me to nothing.

She took my eyes and she closed them slowly.
It darkened each corner of my body.
It wrapped me with cold whispers
and it showed the portrait of my destiny,
where the dreams falls.

She took my eyes and she closed them smoothly.
It darkened each corner of my soul.
It dispersed fog over me
and you started up of my chest,
where the dreams falls.As nature turns evil

The ground began to shake
Seconds later all were dead
That's how little warning they had
It did not provide the usual warning signs
Of an imminent eruption

Hot gases, ash and rook fragments escape
From below endangering the life of all
Lava flows to burn or bury everything
That comes across... glowing avalanche

Pyroclastic flows so hot and choking
That if one is caught in certainly be killed
Millions of metric tons of sulphur dioxide
Blasted into the atmosphere

Blood, roar, death... the sleeper awakes
Constant menace... the sleeper awakes
Total wipeout... the sleeper awakes
Sudden violence... the sleeper awakes

As nature turns evil... eruption out of hell
As nature turns evil... the inferno

Blood, roar, death... the sleeper awakes
Constant menace... the sleeper awakes
Total wipeout... the sleeper awakes
Sudden violence... the sleeper awakes

As nature turns evil... the sleeper awakes
As nature turns evil...Oh life, why are you so?
hello life... your jokes makes me suffer...
why life?
Why You turned my happiness into vague memories?

my window I watch the sky
thinking of you life...

why did you take from me everything that make me happy?
why make me cry of sadness?
you could make me cry of happiness...Gathering the slaves into the caves
Shrieks of terror at our eyes ablaze!
We've come to enslave the human race
Assimilate the DNA

(We must not submit or obey!)

Mankind and his third eye
Assimilated through the mind
Separated, downgraded
To better suit a population
Of complete slaves
Brainwashed and conditioned
From cradle to grave
To be a serf
In the system
Artificial introduction
Indoctrination
Into a New World Order
War and murder
Feeding on the fear

Mankind must serve the Dragon!!
Mankind will serve us well!Mercury's thin atmosphere
The most massive black hole
Desolation implication
Welcome vaporization
Behemoth sits at the heart of the giant
Sad thing is its proud of it
Spent upper states
Elimination of daysDon't be stupid!
You have the power!

Look at the mirror!
What can you see?
Your strained mug
and eyes without life
So look at the mirror!
Skin and bones only
This effete corpse
it's what you are!

Change your life!
Don't believe the lies!
Poison instead of brain
It's a slow death
Suicidal way
Suicidal way
into hell

Sole salvation - isolation
Isolation - from the drugs

Don't be a puppet
Don't be the corpse
It's one from way
to the hell

So don't be stupid!
You have the power!
It's sole way!Centuries of brine bestow upon us endless power and meat
Tides are all the fortifications we need

To trade with thee, you must sheath your swords
Share your bounty or your bones will feed the coral

All of the Aegeaen sea bows in the shadow of Crete

Salinity births our prosperity
Behind unassailable sands lie uncanny luxuries

Centuries of bronze bestow upon us endless peace and meat
Dominate the waves and fortress walls become obsoleteVoices in the dark are calling 
The walls within your mind are falling 
The privileged holy precepts are lies 
And the guilt from so - called sin 
cannot tame the beast within 

Open wide the gates of hell 
Destroy the sacred lies they tell 

Behold the key to unlock the door 
We won't be their victims anymore 
Armed with the power to unleash the inner demon 
We'll fight our way out of this cursed land 

In the ancient garden, a serpent in a tree 
with timeless wisdom teaches her 
Now her eyes are open 
She sees beyond the hoax that enslaved the world for centuries 

Rise up from the flames and go to war with me 
Let's bring their darkest fears to life 

Dark truth defeats all of the lies that were meant to control us 
Drive deep the thorns into the flesh of a fictional god 

Cathedrals crumble in defeat 
Women writhing in the streets 
Lift their skirts and pull their hair 
Copulation everywhere 
Unleash the demon deep within 
Let the Devil's reign begin!(Instrumental)Step inside the Technicolor dream machine
And listen to the fury of a world you've never seen
Hellfire's all around in Sensurround sound
Once you get a taste of it, you're never coming down
Tune in, turn on
While you've still got a soul to sell
Tune in, turn on
We'll take you straight to Hell
Wrap yourself in psychotropic ecstasy
In surrealistic visions of e-lec-trici-ty
Change the meaning of the word "reality"
There's no limit to your soul, no telling what you'll see
Anything your heart desires
What are you waiting for?
Why don't you set your mind on fire?
And open up the door....
Throw caution to the wind
Strike reason from the rhyme
Electric Hellfire is burning in your mind
Hell ain't just another place to visit when you're dead
Paradise is in your mind
So feed your head
Tune in, turn on
While you've still got a soul to sell
Tune in, turn on
We'll take you straight to Hellsomething's surely not for everyone
never know
never want to tell, to share
adjusting my dream-to-reality ratio
should i go
should i face against both extremes?
i need to be
a man who enjoys his fear
try to get used with this opacity
i need to see
beyond those clouds of doubts
to play around with this obscurity
a fusion of dreams, wish and illusions
at some degree
my mind just told me: "that's unreal"
sometimes i feel tired of praying everyday
asking god same kind of thing over and over again
i need to be
a man who walks his shoes
try to invent my own felicity
i need to see
beyond those clouds of doubts
to play around with this obscurityI will not obey god fearing ways
Who are you to say that I have to pay...?

Have faith, it's not a saga, have no fear, shown to all, give your money to the church, and your place in Heavan will be secured.

You make your money from deceit, from the poor and the weak.
Believe me when I say that I will not bow down to blind faith..fuck no.

Have faith, it's not a saga, have no fear, shown to all, give your money to the church, and your place in Heavan will be secured.

I will not obey god fearing ways...Alone
I walked
My way
Why
I've met
You there?

Now
I Am
So tired
Of life

Enjoy
My grief
Control
My will
Lie down
In my grave

I want you!
I want you!
You feed my power
For you
I dieScarred
Unleashed for vengeance
Destroying everything on my way
Won't await their sentence
Never under their sway
Can this world be normal?
When an executioner becomes a judge
When a corrupted man becomes a God
And when life on earth
Becomes a living hell

So
We're back here yet again
Looking for a welfare never found
Deluded once again
Open-eyed but blind
Fully drenched in acid bath
Unable to complete the path
Distorted by the thirst of dough
Eroded minds but we never get enough

Endless stairs to nowhere
My wilted mouth is my last lair

Weakened, declining
Wreaking havoc in the last
Human part of me

Conceived in the sin and there
Is no remedy
Collapsing at birth and there's
No return

We are the wolves
We seize the night:
No slave, no lord
Devoted to the unlight
We're cruel and determined:
Beware our hordes

Asphyxiation erasing your mind
Domination crushing your life
You're war-infected, corroded
And aloneMerchants plot, oubliettes poise
Dank ill begot, harrowing diffuse

Sinking liths ferment
Heedless bill of fare
Murmur depth of field

Silage digest ... drank of peril
Till father terror firma 

Mephitic yield consummates
Faction conseeds 

Adjourning mills ... ensueIn the heart of the rampant woods
In the virgin forest
You can hear the note, the pulse
Everlasting through the seasons

Fruit and seed and every leaf
All is humming to this song
Lions and mice and every bird
All is humming to this song

The spiral of thousand colors
Is spinning in the eye
Of this green vast field
In blind mindless ecstasy

Thunder and rain and every ray
All is humming to this song
Virtues and demons and every soul
All is humming to this song

All is screaming to this song
All is roaring to this song
All is chirping to this song
All is howling to this songOn the darkest night of all, he sets out on no-man's-quest to destroy the world.
Leave behind your innocence.
You have no time for regret as none shall survive.
Mark the street with your blood; make believe that you're the god of all mankind.
Capture the non-believer; extract them of their limbs.
Feed them to the children for they will partake in the future. I fell short of a thousand ways to rid us of a world of hate.
We rearrange out lives to stare death in the eyes. 
Confliction is tearing away from this civilization.
Face to face with the world unknown.(Instrumental)Undead, Dracula rises from his grave 
Human blood is what he craves 
Long now has his power grown 
He comes to claim a victim for his own 

He comes from the Land Beyond the Forest 

(Back-masked secret message) 

His cold black heart still bleeds from the pain 
True love once lost must be regained 

He sees her face from afar 
her beauty so sublime 
He takes a solemn vow in his dark soul 
to have her for all time 

Each night she closes her eyes 
to find that she's been carried far beyond the black horizon 
The night wind tickles her face 
Enamored with this regal demon who's taken her 

Galloping through the plains, over rolling hills 
and toward the shadow mountain 
Dark pleasure beckons her as she silently lets go 
of the mediocre mess of mortal life 

Disappointing drudgery 
was not what she had hoped her life would be 

She reigns with Dracula 
over the children of the night 
Their kingdom shall rise 
to rule over all human kindA race against concepts of time and space
A race we are all a part of
we must leave this apocalyptic ruin
which we used to call home
"Of all the things you left, at least we cared for her.
Come away..."(Instrumental)I don't know what I have become 
Through the years that you made me anger 
Fuck! It's my black heart 
Then I close my eyes 
I see it, it's called.... 

Reality! 

Time passes by 
And it's taking a part of me 
Without your life 
Soon you will be! 

Like the shadows from a wraith 
I am a murder machine 
Created to war against 
The blackheart in me 

BLACKHEART 

I take all the bad things 
that people say to me 
And I turn into darkness 
Fuck! I am the one 
The black sheep of the family 
And they recognize it 

Time passes by 
And it's taking a part of me 
Without your life 
Soon you will be! 

Like the shadows from a wraith 
I am a murder machine 
Created to war against 
The blackheart in me 

BLACKHEART 

Anger, inside of me (x2) 

Waiting for the day
When they could get
All the pain they've done 
To the society...

And all comes to and end! 

Like the shadows from a wraith 
I am a murder machine 

BLACKHEART (x2)Thoughts and memories of what was pain, 
Only a thought I'll never feel again. 
Tired of hate, greed, love and shame, 
I'll become machine today 

The process taking all the life from me, transformation to control again 
Set free of their souls, changed into another being. 

Scars and memories of what was pain, 
I remember the days I was the same. 
Now built of wires and chains, 
Left still with this human brain. 

I can feel my insides ripping at their ends, its tearing inside of me.. 

I find I miss all the insanity, and all the woes I left behind 
Reminisce on the bitterness, now I know my choice is right. 

To be devoid of emotion, free to exist without disdain 
Stronger, Better, Faster than before 
Seeing All Die I Will Remain.Surmise the mystic realm
Ancient Ishtar, Queen to gods
Stands before thy gate, Enki
The ancient coven

Watcher to the gate hearken
And hear as it is written
Daughter of sin in siege

Lest i attack the coven
And break apart its barriers
Lest i attack its walls by force

Of your graces

Spawned in the dawn of darkness
With her gaze i stand to resist
Destroy those whom raise before me

Her corpse, procession to my throne

Dark death gravery
I stand before you Absu
Dark Death Gravery
Challenge you for your throne

Absu lashed with spears of death
I summon the elders of time ago
With infernal fire i assail the abyss
And the demon spawned waves abound
Recant as the elders possessed within
Absu was pale with fear as believed
With sword i severed the demons skin
Upon Ishtar the body, head upon throne

Iak Sakkak has summoned his legion in haste
The truth of my eternal quest has passed upon
Insurged the liege rises against Iak Sakkak
Thy is he whom commands this plane infernal
Thy is he whom stands as overlord of all
Thy is he whom destroys all increpit and untrue

I arrived to besiege the gate of UR
Kurgarru sensing my presence cried out
Ereshkigal armed with fire arrived forth
Looked upon the queen of corpses and wept
With ray of fire he cried out in vein
Ereshkigal mighty in Cutha turned her face
With bolt of darkness i cried out in deaths name
Once more an ungod, and one more head to throne

Upon the corpse of Ereshkigal i gazed
Weeping the water of life of Enki
Upon the corpse of Ishtar i gazed
Removed my sword from its sheath of death
Upon the corpse of Iak Sakkak i gazed
Raising my sword to the sky of eternal death
Upon thy throne i gazed upon there eyes
With mind possessed i destroyed all influenced

Watcher to the gate hearken
And hear as it is written
Son of sin in siege
Thee are pale with fear

Lest i attack the coven
And break apart its barriers
Lest i take its walls by force
Close forth the gate

In my haste i close thy gate, i summon forth the guards in wait
So i've written thine time has come, as one more ungod has come upon my throne...Restless side of the psyche

could give us an insight
on how she sees the world
in a much different perspective.

We've passed our innocent days
since many years ago,
traded them with anger and despair
and with constant discomfort.

The way we stand together,
The way we fall together,
The way we deal our lives together,
It's all that matters.

Yesterday has gone for good,
Tomorrow will never be the same.
Today is the most difficult time,
for us to understand the plan.

The way we walk together,
The way we cry together,
The way we risk our lives together,
It's all that matters.All the stars could shine
Bright the night, like never before
I'm dreamed I can har the way and I have to be (?)
That's everybody can see

The show has just began
The show has just began

I don't really know What I do, did you got how I feel (?)
Mistaken I never know
It's seems like I sleeping
Into dream we've down that feeling (?)
By the ___ not be true that's I was waiting (?)
And staring a faking (?)
That I need someone to got me they got me (?)

The show has just began
The show has just beganAn array of bullets mask the horizon.
A rain of bombs cloud the sky.
The rich man pushes the button; the poor man is blown to pieces.
A child's dream disrupted
by the crank of the sovereign tank.
The metal monster battalion
drudge through the boiling blood.
A schoolyard scorched by napalm, but no one's played there for years.
The Machines aren't affected by the heat
but the populous beg for death...
Gears are grinding, pistons: pumping,
rotors are turning, bullets: flying.
They strike at midnight sharp
but robots don't need light to fight.
The barrage slowly slowly passes; everyone is dead by dawn.I made you straddle on an accute block of wood
The corner penetrates the butt, it feels so good
I keep your skinned legs apart by bindings
Tying stones or weights to the feets of the victim
Placing burning torchs next to the naked body
The torture is augmented
Fastening a bowl with live rat to the stomach
Suddenly your anus begins to ache
Bearing you down, even harder on the corner
Falling to the ground, now you've reached the border
Unimaginable pain, the torture was taken to extreme
From medieval times until today it remains the same
Hoisted up whereupon you are lowered
Victims weight rests on the point of the corner
In accordance with the interrogators desire
I can vary the pressure to total body weight
Arms are stretched backwards, body is pulled up
By arms onto a bench, feets are weighted down
Slowly pulled up, stretched above your head
Body is then lowered, pulled up till you're deadone would argue it was far too close 
for a greater society reversing into calamity 
unbolted its threshold of fear and angst 
confusion heightened at the crossroads of destiny 
somehow nearing the boundaries of turmoil 
karma, justice, divine intervention 
equalizing intermingled imbalances 
from gloom, rise forth the glowing spirit of hope 
we should never dissolve our leap of faith 
keep reeling out to the omnipresent reality 
stretching our mere limits of understanding 
where the end is really just the beginning 
perceive what matters most to earn contented state 
realize its true forms of the animating principle 
the past, the present, the future as well 
god shall reconstruct our microcosmic aspirationsCircles rising from my gaze
Silence howling bright 
Clouds colliding in my haze
Dying rays of light

Rising stolen from my flesh
I grasp insanity
Losing touch with all that I caress
Fly towards infinity

Turning into something frail
Losing my humanity
Ascending slow towards my grail
Burning crops of sanity

Ascent finds the mindless ending
Climax is in sight
Endless burns a new beginning
Swallowed into mightDon't stand at my grave and cry,
The human mind can't conceive the substance
Within these borders no one other exist
Don't mourn for the bravery and freedom
Only reapers, reaping the wisdom
I force the matter to collide with my mind

On the dreadful moments something sparkles inside me
On the dreadful omens, there is nothing you can't redeem

I don't accept this depth of time, so brief
The future wounds and sudden grief
Inside the body of the elder gloom
This picture gave me infinite relief
The desolation and the sorrow
for those who died, or those who are
The only fellow, a rusty gallows
just vicious night, thick like death

Dig and watch - Just stones and soil
Dig and wonder - It's necessary end
Dig and hear - The rhythm of the silence
and whisper the funeral blues

Keep fresh the grass upon the grave,
These roots will always be my chains,
Like spoils of death are shining with awe.
By this cell I drowned in the waves,
a body like ship is ready to sail,
WhLooking at the vagrants through upturned noses
A thousand unblinking eyes silently watching
Your every move, rejoice and burn the enemy
Burn the enemy, we are the enemy.
Burn all those Hollywood salons
Murder in the name of high fashion
I promise vanity isn't a sin
But it feels good in the morningUnder the rug lurk rats.

(Repeats)Doomed For Death

Unhuman torture , capital punishment 
Bloody execution before the eyes of all .
Tieing at the wheel of car , hands , legs ,
Breaking by iron pole and hammer .

Stretched on stake for warning and
To a intimidate of another enemies the parish .
Pointed stake pilling into back seat
Point comes from body right of back.

Stitching in sack together with stones , throwing to river.
( She cannot deserve , the breaking in wheel )

Doomed and torture to death
Puling from skin stretching on stud .
Doomed and torture to death
Suspend on hook and smashing head by boll .

Quartering body by wide axe, the head , 
The legs , the hands nailed for warning .
Pulling rest of body by horses 
Blooded bowels are all spilling .

Lay her to excavating pit and pelt by earth 
At the end cutting heart with pointed stake .
Lay her to excavating pit and pelt by earth 
At the end cutting heart with pointed stake .

Stitching in sack together with stones , throwing to river .
( She cannot deserve, the breaking in wheel ) 

Doomed and torture to death
In legs drilling holes by lead casting .
Doomed and torture to death
Roasting on fire and from back carving a piece of skin .

Bonding with legs to a horse dragging to death
The cause for bleeding in your brain.
Burning alive by slowly death
Successing stick from scrambling meat.

Doomed and torture to death
Breaking in wheel sympathetic cross -examination in slaughtering room .
Doomed and torture to death 
You burn down in flames on bonfire ... 
... Bonfire ... 

Doomed For Death .Snuff your junk.
Take your tabs.
Kill your heart.
Kill your mind!
You are the pulse of the next dimension.
Make you high.
With ecstacy.
So dance! Dance dance!
Don't use your brain.They call
Call to me from afar
I sense them/ I feel them/ I know them
But I know them not
They exist
But not in this reality
Calling me to return

Realms I've travelled
I will see you again
In timelessness I know you
And we are of one

Separated I wait
For the time
Of return
Unity

I feel their call
I know I'll have to leave
Soon I'll heed this call
Reminding me of what is/ will be/ was
On stellar waves I've travelled
And will be so again
If I have to wait an eternity
I willGrey clouds witch are begin drove with cold wind
 Notified the snow - coverod lands
 About the black sunset
 The Power of the White Moon was beginning...
 This shadowy light drove away from sleepy houses
 All those whose hearts were filled
 With nostalgia about the lost Motherland
 To eternally young clear vibrant night
 To far unknown lands
 The last flocks of fired birds
 Left the grey chillish heaven
 And took shelter in the tops of ancient pines
 At down they'll continue their journey
 The ground help her breath
 But Night is dictating her rules
 The life goes by in other laws
 If you're weak-you will be victim of more strong people
 So it was forever
 The flower of fern has burst with blood-red
 The grass is covered with cold dew
 The fog has concealed all mysteries of the night right
 From the stange looks.
 Here the new life had begun
 In drunk round dance of stars
 In violent dance of trees
 In fullmoon light
 In the howling of the wolves in the dense forests
 In the cries of the black crows in the sky
 In the silence of the fish in the moddy lakes
 In the rustle of the leavens of the trees
 Everywhere all was heard only one thing:
 "He was born. He had been awaited forever!"
 The child will leave the peky outer skin
 She-wolf will bring up him with her milk
 Here he'll grow up and will be strong
 And enter this world like a Master
 He will avenge the blood witch was innocent shed
 And everybody must get his due
 The wolf-his victim the sheep-fangs to her throat
 The old absurd world must collapse:
 The new counting out of time is beginning -
 He was born! And he had been awaited forever!(Instrumental)Dying, fire of life
Battle, falsehood and truth
Deafened, tears of compassion
Dreaming, machine of hate

No more seeing, just blackness
Body aching, pathetic
Always thinking, my illness
Slowly sinking, and fogging(Instrumental)(Fart)

Jesus!

Yeah! Talk about a kickass song, I tell you what.(Instrumental)Canis Majoris 
Canis Majoris 

All of them giants 
All of themBound and damned I loved you then 
You broke my spark your tearing me apart 
Backed into the poorest view 
A pseudo life another mask you hide 
I've seen this all before 
like verses from my dreams 
The coldest place I've never been 
Incomplete when i met you 
your shreds and scars 
make up for what you are 
Deny what doesn't click 
Ignore what makes you think 
And plunge into 
A world of nothing new 
Dying eternally 
Falling internally for you 
Wasted all my feelings hating you 
Eternally falling internally for you 
Wasted all my feelings hating you 
Arise up from the sea 
And wrap your arms around me 
Reign your drugs down on this place 
And drown us all in our disgrace 
All because of you that I got this 
All because of you that I want this 
Lately I never bleed for you 
Take it from the truth as I saw it 
Take it from the noose as I saw it 
Lately I never believed in you 
Never fuckin bled for you 
Awake the green goliath 
Awake the green god!And when my eyelids are hold by my fingers
and by strenght i split then hardfully
my lips at once by dextrous hands of reality
are stiched by the thread of resignation

And when i blow my nose into a bottle,
i inhale the fog of odour
a tar alternates the blood, because my nose
is already clogged with dextrous hands of reality 

And when i pull headphones off my ears
to listen out for the news from afar
my lips at once by dextrous hands of reality 
are stiched by the thread of resignation

I also don`t eat and i don`t drink at all 
- as my mouth is stiched up.
I don`t touch, i don`t grab
- as my hands by sewing are absorbedShe detest me
She flee like a possessed one
No matter, there is no way
I need to feel her skin
She's the light, she's my sickness

I don't want you
I just want to be alone
Stay the Hell away from me

This arrow makes me sick

Open the earth
And stab me inside
I'll do anything to keep you away
I don't belong to you

I know your leaves
Are looking into my eyes
I know you hate me, you don't want me
But I'll never give it up
I'm stuck on you
Your branches cradle me
My seeds of hope are everlasting
I'll always be right here

Just one kiss
Before your skin becomes a trunk
Just one kiss
Just one kiss
Before your leaves turn into crowns
Just one kiss

I know your leaves
Are looking to my eyes
I know you hate me, you don't want me
But I'll never give it up
I'm stuck on you
Your branches cradle me
My seeds of hope are everlasting
I'll always be right here

I know your leaves
Are looking to my eyes
I know you hate me, you don't want me
But I'll never give it up
I'm stuck on you
Your branches cradle me
My seeds of hope are everlasting
I'll always be right here

So you can't move
Now it's time to get paid
I've ran for you insanely
This arrow makes me sick
Now you're a tree
It changes everything
You're not going anywhere
Your roots will carve my heart

Just one kiss
Before your skin becomes a trunk
Just one kiss

I know your leaves
Are looking to my eyes
I know you hate me, you don't want me
But I'll never give it up
I'm stuck on you
Your branches cradle me
My seeds of hope are everlasting
I'll always be right here

I know you look into my eyes
And I don't care if
You never turn my love...
(Be right here)
I know
You're looking into my eyes
And I don't care if
You never turn my love...
Turn my love backDaddy, daddy, everytime you burp, you gain some calcium!!!

You know what's funny?

What?

Instead of last of the Mohicans, you can call it Maxomohicans!Dark is my boyfriend
Dark is my best friend
Dark is the one I can't ignore
Dark is no coward
He is so lovely
He is the one I'm yearning for
I really want him
Cold hearted seraphim
I know what's in store
He cannot show love
He only feels pain
Sadness to the core

Be my lover and you will see me
Love is not the way to set my heart free
Pain and sorrow is all it knows and
Take me now, oh please please dark man

Dark is my savior
Dark is my plaything
He has his cold grip on me
Dark is so sexy
He gives me shivers
My true love my fantasy
Please mister darkness
Come to my doorstep
You will find the key
I want to join you
In your safe arms
Please don't ignore my plea

Dark made me his slave
That makes me happy
Without dark I cannot live
Dark plans to take me
Down to his dark lair
Through his halls my life I give
This is the sad tale
Of me and my dark man
I do hate him so(Instrumental)there's no good for me
no beauty I can see
no sins behind me

We have one aim, and we will follow it 
Fanatically and ruthlessly to the grave" 

The wolf spirit rises from his dignified death, 
To a beckoning call from an unknown voice 
From his death, new life is given unto him, 
As a reward for his paths 

"Breathe your words of fire, set my soul alight, 
Foreseen and almighty, now we see your truths!" 

Now with wings and heart of dragon, 
He is arisen from the flames 
To soar into the heavnes, 
The dwelling of his race... 

Breathing words of fire, 
Setting souls aflame 
Freseen and almighty, 
Now they see his truth 

Soaring beyond the threshold, 
Seen from below, a shining star 
To guide me on my path to eternal glory 

Rejoice, the sight of Man-God 
From beast of burden, to a celestial body... 

Ascension!!! 

"You mustn;t act yourself, you must obey, 
You must give in, you must submit to this 
Overwhelming need to obey"Long ago, you lived in desolation
Now is time to make decisions
And you know time is short
Just follow the signs...
When there is no place to go
And there is no way to take
The book of death is open
Before your eyes
Out of your mind
Searching for a reason
To live
The house of death is calling you
Don't think twice, get through the gate
The lands, the unknown lands of the black hordes
The lords of eternal night
When you get to these lands
And open your eyes, you will see,
The life you had was a bad dream(Instrumental)the silence before storm
behind the curtains of false hope
the dying parks of hollow dreams
and fallen leaves of broken and defeat
hail nothingness, embrace fallacies

relocate life?
failures but no second tries
guilt sin and lies
haunting inner fights

the absence before fall
behind the curtains of tainted show
the falling skies of false beliefs
and crumbling halls, within

to die, reborn, to rise and fall
the endless play, what could not be
repeat like never before

embrace darkness, hail clarity

I don't seek forgiveness don't step in my way

I spit at the holy I revel in sin
I laugh at his children I repent nothing

No one can stop me to live as I want
Me breathing is a sin in your book

I need the pleasure the pleasure in sin
I can't deny that I revel in sin

Deep inside
They envy me
They know they are
Slaves to God

Deep inside they envy me
But to God they are sworn
For that reason they must stop me
I bow for none

I repent nothing I live in sin I don't care what people think
I live my life they way I want I am a living sin

Don't push that cross in my face and say saved
I don't seek forgiveness don't step in my way

Fools you think you're safe
In your world of light
But you are like dust
In a hurricane
Your world was raised by them
Made by dreams of the gods
And your empty lives
Is only a fools work

The work of the week are what you are made of
Soon they will wake up the bringers of chaos
No God or man can withstand their will
Soon they will wake up your world will be dead

In your veins runs the blood
of a prince of the Gods
So in many ways
You are spawned from chaos
You will always be
an heir of the week
As long as your world will stay alive

The work of the week are what you are made of
Soon they will wake up the bringers of chaos
No God or man can withstand their will
Soon they will wake up your world will be dead

Raised from chaos
Soon to be chaos again
A dream of the Gods
Soon to awake
Fragile lives
Soon to be dead
Made by the week
Soon to be dead

Fools you think you're safe
In your world of light
But you are like dust
In a hurricane
Your world was raised by them
Made by dreams of the gods
And your empty lives
Is only a fools work

The work of the week are what you are made of
Soon they will wake up the bringers of chaos
No God or man can withstand their will
Soon they will wake up your world will be deadFeral, Ferocious, and Unfettered

May the trees welcome us into the misty forest
The spirit of Odin and Hammer of Thor bless this wooden shelter
The sharp edges of our swords protect our home
Invited we are by the glorious winds to enter this desolate kingdom

The fire dances all around us
The tribe gathers and celebrates our heathenpride
The mighty powers of fire lift me way up high
Together we chant old melodies we learned as a child

The newborn spring, a blessing by mother Freyja
Nature celebrates its splendor with eternal pride
The never-ending seas gleam against a burning sun
Tomorrow we set sail to wherever our fates would surely find

(Join me, my son, and together we shall embrace the earth
Let the winds blow on and on, let them hold you tight
The sound of clashing iron and the smell of blood
For you I fight, to defend your tribe from this sway of God)

Chorus:
And as the legend goes,
The pagan woods, bid us welcome
FerocAwake O sleeping one hear my voice, listen to the wind blow Bones of the vanquished crunch beneath our feet as we step into the unknown Become the leader or be led, reject the bullshit you've been fed Just as the Lion eats the lamb, the strong are blessed, the weak are damned, and Mother Nature knows no other way, Tyrants care not for your rights, get off your ass and start a fight, you choose the role to play...Predator or Prey Illusion shattered, nothing matters save the sweet taste of revenge We ride the demon winds of rage, bloody battle to the end! Shed the weakness and be strong, to win is right - to lose is wrong, the clock has struck, it won't be long Just as the Lion eats the lamb, the strong are blessed, the weak are damned, and Mother Nature knows no other way, Tyrants care not for your rights, get off your ass and start a fight, you choose the role to play...Predator or Prey Wars are not won by rules of fair play, but destroying the assholes who stand in our way When life cooks you a shit souffle You pick yourself up and say.... Na, na na na na....fuck fuck fuck fuckaroo, Na, na na na na....flippety fuckity doo! Rise from the mire of disgrace, wipe the mud off your face, take up your sword and earn your place... Just as the Lion eats the lamb, the strong are blessed, the weak are damned, and Mother Nature knows no other way, Tyrants care not for your rights, get off your ass and start a fight, you choose the role to play...Predator or PreyMy impure soul 
Seeking the words 
From the Lord of the Darkness 

My meat it feeds 
From the bath in the sacrifice's rise
Of the fire's flame

Black moon 
The eternal cold night 
I hear the Cerberus howl
Guarding in the prison 
The next virginSpace
Take my after
Life and drown it in the
Wine
And watch me die
Love, the quiet
Night

Space, SpaceSo, my journey starts from here. 
This is a journey to the stars. 

Can you see them tonight? They shine so bright ! 
I want to live among them. 

Now. I am chased. 
My road leads me to this place. 

This mountain is full of promises 
Climb it and the world will shine too. 

It will be as no one else has ever existed. 
It will be like you are the first man on earth. 

From distance, people will seem like ants. 
And their prisons like small glass spheres. 

You will see things from a different aspect. 
Your mind will ascend to dazzling heights. 

Your company will be the white clouds. 
But be not afraid. You will be safe. 

You want to make this world a better one. 
Alright then! Go on! 

Just remember all those things you've learned! 
You must turn everything upside down! 
You must burn all that is rotten to the core! 
You must bring this world to an end! 

You owe it to yourself! 
Bring down all that is evil! 
Bring down all that is good! 
You are alone. It is just you! 

You owe it to those who do not exist yet. 
Bring down all that is not pure! 
Bring down all that is not just! 
It is only you. You will be alone! 

This painful grief must come to an end. 
It suffocates us. It drowns us. 
It takes away all the will to live. 
This unbearable grief must end. 

Change. Requires. Sacrifice. Of self. 
Survival. Requires. Sacrifice. Of self. 

Change requires sacrifice of self. 
Survival requires sacrifice of self. 
You must change quick. You must survive! 
You must adapt quick. You must stay alive! 

Innocence is not coming back. 
You must not feel that ashamed. 
I will rise. I will rise. I will rise 
While the sun of dawn burns your eyes! 

So beautiful is this burden. 
While asleep it never goes away. 
Beautiful are these painful ties 
That drive my will above all of the rest. 

There is no coming back. 
The clouds will hang below me. 
The wild birds will fly with me. 
And I will watch you from afar. 

Ashes will be brought by the wind. 
Of what you all once knew and loved. 
All is scattered in the air you breath. 
Take some time to admire your past life. 

Just remember all those things you've learned! 
You must turn everything upside down! 
You must burn all that is rotten to the core! 
You must bring this world to an end. 

You owe it to yourself! 
Bring down all that is evil! 
Bring down all that is good! 
You are alone. It is just you! 

You owe it to those who do not exist yet. 
Bring down all that is not pure! 
Bring down all that is not just! 
It is only you. You will be alone! 

But I am not ready yet. 
This menace approaches. 
I can listen to their voices closing in. 
I must hide from the face of the earth.(Instrumental)What sense do you lack, that you cannot hear this song, that you turn away from this warmth into your unlit world, and crawl, naked and afraid? Thank you for this sweet communion, that rolls like a ghost on my tongue, empty if not for your name, silent except for your song. I can remember your face. I taste you whenever I breathe. If you would come back to me, shining, I would lay my head at your feet. I can't believe that you're gone. Here, on my back I lay here, foul-tongued, working to build a cage of bitter words to trap revelations. You, you bought the fucking scripture whole, and your soul is fed hand to mouth on another's words, starving, soon gone without a trace. You have one chance left to accept absolution: dance like a madman to the demanding beat in your blood, no matter it's bleeding from your feet wherever you step. Dance like a whirlwind, or you'll be lost; and if the pressure is too strong, if the desire to rest fills you with joy, then you must leave this sacred room. You don't belong here, and you might as well be dead. How I wish, how I yearn after stars, when all I can see is this light from a fire that died years ago. If I excise the root, the rest of this sick longing might disappear. Child, oh child, can you hear me? You weren't worth the price after all. If your heart had truly been open, you would have come back when I called. You won't ever see me again.It's okay to justify what you fucking do
In the name of your manmade God
As long as it suits your fucking selfish purpose
You sit in your fucking tower judging the world with your bullshit

Perversions of a sadist
Just another fucking victim
In a world full of sin
There's no fucking mercy

We know there's no way to
Change what you've done
And the sins that you owe for

It's okay to justify what you fucking do
In the name of your manmade God
As long as it suits your fucking selfish purpose
You sit in your fucking tower judging the world with your bullshit
Basking in the glory of the church of propaganda

Out your fucking scrotum sack
Feed them to the fucking dogs
And then we'll see who begs for mercy
Wishing for that sweet release

Soon comes a day when you will have no power
Walls of deceit won't save your demise
Wait 'til they see who begs for mercy
Your manmade salvation will be your demise

We know ther's no way to
Change what you've done
And the sins that your owe for

It's okay to justify what you fucking do

Victims of politician's greed
Nothing you can do - Fuck it all!
Complete lie, your vote is useless
Your peace is just a lie!
We have to kill them all!Across the fields
Of destruction
Glimpse of darkness alone
Camp fires burning
Into the night
Forward daylight
End the fight
Distant fire
Clouds up my mind
Shinning bright
Shinning bright
In the sky

Water is flowing the water is forming
The Water is flowing the water is forming
Water emotion is growing within you
Water emotion is forming within you

The Smell of the wind
Its scent is No longer sweet
Have all the feelings have drown
Nothing is left in this town
Forward daylight
End the fight
(c) C. Poupoutsi 2012Made a God to deceive the weak 
To follow a ghost from Galilee 
To kill for Christ in the name of peace 
And die alone in poverty. 

Raise the cross so all can see, 
For you must crawl and follow me, 
You kneel in shit before my throne 
For I am God and God is RomeSucker love is heaven sent.
You pucker up, our passion's spent.
My hearts a tart, your body's rent.
My body's broken, yours is bent.

Carve your name into my arm.
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed.
Cuz there's nothing else to do,
Every me and every you.

Sucker love, a box I choose.
No other box I choose to use.
Another love I would abuse,
No circumstances could excuse.

In the shape of things to come.
Too much poison come undone.
Cuz there's nothing else to do,
Every me and every you.
Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Sucker love is known to swing.
Prone to cling and waste these things.
Pucker up for heavens sake.
There's never been so much at stake.

I serve my head up on a plate.
It's only comfort, calling late.
Cuz there's nothing else to do,
Every me and every you.
Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Like the naked leads the blind.
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind.
Sucker love I always find,
Someone to bruise and leave behind.

All alone in space and time.
There's nothing here but what here's mine.
Something borrowed, something blue.
Every me and every you.
Every me and every you,
Every Me...he

Every me and every you,
Every Me...he [x4]Thinking of eternity,
I remember the past.
Looking at the present
I wonder, who will survive at last?

Existence will stop being.
You and I will stop being.
The moons will disappear.
The sunshine, black out.

So brillant sparkles,
deafening sparkles.
Oh! The ashes dancing with the wind,
you and I will look from above.

Stop thinking of eternity,
to turn myself into it.
Stop looking at the present,
to become just nothing.

At the infinite we dance,
let's play a bit more time.
The hour is coming closer,
everything's gonna be all right.


So brillant sparkles,
deafening sparkles.
Oh! The ashes dancing with the wind,
you and I will look from above.


So brillant sparkles,
deafening sparkles.
Oh! The ashes dancing with the wind,
you and I will look from above.On bigger than everything
In the crown of your own self you preach darkness
Yet would you be able to obey the lack of light?
Darkness, light, word, existence
Could it be false?
Salvation is nothing- nothing is salvation
The great fractal of existence sinks into itself
Nature calls for destroyer, desires
It's the highest time for zero to come
Collapsing reality craves for the end
Everything rots in itself
Maybe its time to stop worshipping the own image
So non-existence is the only sense?
I rise in spheres of madness
In darkness of unknown I perish
To see, to remain in all time
Eternity in second, not!In his commorancy, the illuminary motions their forthcoming
Phlegmbuoyant heirlooms, moored & reposed
Mortal impelled beyond causality 
The ordinance streams 
Equidistant the churlish refashion 
Ulterior pneumatic antiques mercurial agenda peeled 
Ruin - the verdict
Coefficient of the loom, slothfoul plethora flourish in disgrace
Blotting dim, entourage of phreqs encompass 
Utricles gloat in abeyance
Riddling puce sleet bleaking Fatherland null
Transfusion of the imbued pending
The consumptive dour
Foretastes the misshapen ones
Covetous juncture dilates

Plasm umbilicus steep an courant 

Supinely bled the pupae shed

Tyme fly blown disfigments conclude
The pastures shall never thrive for those who sow
Seepia thee peerless shade
Your orbs to mirror...It's seems I'm not the legacy
But the creator of your pain
Another broken intimacy
You're looking at me in disdain

When hope dies, I'm left behind with shame
Imploring to the shadows, but they can't clear my name
When hope dies, I'm left to death proclaimed
What was cherised is lost, fading away

Our descent is falling into place
Sorrow and sanity is what remains
Our battle can never be solved
Sorrow and sanity is what will regain

Hope ... dies
Hope ... fades

My patience is over,anger instead
You're the decil in this breading nest
You've carved me, almost to death
My care is over, no more tears to shed

As hope dies, razors shine through the red
Her veins wide and open. Blood is flowing within
My hope dies when she's bleeding, freed by the death
My downfall will beginI lay rest my weary feet
The shadows dance towards me
Lying under those greening trees
Death cold gale sighs through the eve

Once gleaming flame is growing weak
I hear their call, it beckons me
Looking at those falling leaves
The eyes of god stare back at meI, me, mine
I follow the signs
I, me, mine
Take what I need
Give me strength
But don't fight back
Give me strength
Now you don't exist

Stand up straight
There's only me
I'm your world
There's nothing outside
Listen to me
I'm always right
Listen to me
'Cos you're always wrong(Instrumental)So you met someone who set you back on your heels
Goody, goody
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
Goody, goody
So you gave him your heart to
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
And now how do you do

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night
Goody, goody
So you think that love is a barrel of dynamite
Goody, goody
Hooray and Hallelujah, you had it coming to ya
Goody, goody for him, goody goody for me
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you!Where everybody see the light
I see only darkness
What brings pleasure to others
Gives me only pain
Where others find amusement
I only discover the emptiness
For all is heavenly garden
For me is absolute hell

I walk alone, not with the flock
I have my own road and my way
I see deception but not the whole truth
I want to step over the unknown

Who always looks at the Sun
Can't see his shadow
It's better to be blind... those blind
Who's listening only what he wants to listen to
Can never hear the truth
It's better to be deaf... those deaf
Where everybody see the light
I see only darkness
What brings pleasure to others
Gives me only pain

Listen to the tales about the eternal life
Be the obedient sheep in flock
Stay on your knees, dirty slaves ov god
But for me is the Hell in Paradise

It's easy to get lost in the Garden of Eden
Among the trees of deception
it ain't easy to find the tree of truth
But it is hard to know that there is a ban
and not to step over the line
For me there is the Hell in ParadiseWherever Our Deaths May Carry Us
By Itay Necrofog Krasilshikov

I was gazing, entranced at the sky above me
Soothed by the faint voice of the raven
The breeze took me; removed my senses
Ceased, my chase after the sun is now

And the wind of my flight repels the sands of time

On and on my mind journeys
I linger in the blazed night

And you sacrifice for your God of plague
Such is your fear, immortal justice
Never-ending is only my being
Reborn I am through sons of pride

The doubt has cleared
Emotion, linear to fate
My only thought
Is of infinite truth
A turning of a maze
A riddle of Aeons age
Vanished upon reflection
And acceptance of instability

Breaking the barrier of existence
I found myself limbless
Yet more momentous than life itself
Farewell, O, soul.No Control

Why we can't control
Human behavior
Why we can't understand
Human indifference

Man against animals

who will save us now, as the deaf have turned their back on the blind
I will not leave us to our fate, for mine is worse than deathA thousand mouths to feed, a million hearts to stop.
For the creation of all is only meant to kill.
We litter our selves with religion and hope.
Ware such fools to believe such a manifest, what is left to give?
What more can you take?
In a million ways more than one we all ask the same.
If we are the creation of such a great being, who is the creator of such a morbid race?
Some say we can affect the world with your fairy tales of the past.
Your profits and your saints who raped the dead. 
We wait.
We prey until the angels fall far from the sky.
We are gathered here under the shadows of hell.
We fight for blood.
We die for hope of the world-renowned religion comes to an end. 
We won't stop until  every promise is fulfilled.I spit you out but you will return
My heart is blazing, eyes cannot see
My rule is darkened by the hour
Death is on my hands, marked it shall be

Dark eyes, dark eyes, are haunting me
Dark eyes, dark eyes, are torturing me
Dark eyes, dark eyes, are perishing me
Dark eyes, dark eyes, dark it'll be

Guilt is on my throne, life, soul
Can't live with this, I took, I stole
Dark has been woken, in reign of wrath
I have stolen, your life, our path 

I could search but life won't be found
Can't stand the thought, death has no boundAs I lay in my bed - bed of death
I turn my head - sunbeam in my eyes
I wish awake - or that I had fled
And that I had not told them all lies 

As I turn my head in bed
I face the black side of my soul
The sun vanish through the darkening still
I wish awake - or that I had not led me kill - ME

Keep it in the closet - hide it underneath the bed
I regret (that I was not able to bleed)
My soul had not bled

Looking through the misty clouds towards the heavens
I had hoped that I would have gotten a glimpse of me
Instead a raven roars through my sight

It has come to tell me
"You will never be to see another day!"
No more will I in life swell
Forever (eternity) in darkness dwell
- if I ever was?

I could have been - should have seen
My destiny rushing pass me
But I was too obsessed with my own
It might have been - might have seen
That I never have been(Instrumental)Believe in one god do we

UNSAFE......(Instrumental)The lowly
Piteous, weak, but by nature abhorrent
The fallen
Throwbacks to a distant age
They clamour
United in aspiration
Grovelling for their redeemer

As prophesised 
They turned their voices
Towards the heavens
Using the arts
They called out into the void
"Oh Lord, enlighten our souls"
In nescience
You know not what
Your exaltations have unleashed

It hears
The ovation falls
On open ears
Yet you know not
What your exaltations have unleashed
It hears and it doth come

You know not
What your exaltations have unleashed
It comes
Sing the hosannas and it comes
Sing hosannas and the great host comes

You called for me 
And you shall have me
Through your eyes
I shall pierce your souls with fear
And then you shall runI lost the contact, inside a devouring whirl of confrontation.

Thrown down into the oviduct of gods,
Basking in dust and rotten mantras.
Meandering inside a nettle garden,
Captured under a hellish arch.

They hide the key behind a mask of blinding light,
So I started to search with covered eyes.
Haunted by ghosts and sycophants of religion,
So I started creeping, to the end of the tunnel.

Which door will it open?
Which knowledge manifest?
Is it worth this journey,
I was born for but not blessed?

My senses are confused, I hear myself loud singing,
The symphony of the lost. Bells of desperation are ringing.

Metabolic symptoms, total trance,
Absence of time, utopian aspiration.

Fading structures and forms
Of downward spirals guiding this way;
To the end of the tunnel that was never seen.(Instrumental)The sabbath of the penal servitude of willing is only 
the spiritualization of cruelty 
The failed transmutation of the sorrow of 
being on this earth 
Mice eating gold 
The hatred of everything 
generates images of desolation 
Repulsion for all that is a seed 
Self-erasing world 
To be dead, a house must be still 
Let it all be deleted 
Let all this foundation of earth become desolate 
Wash clean the trick oracle of conscience 
Shatter the hateful mirrors that multiply and proclaim 
Cut off the splendor of the sun 
Cover the moon in night 
Roll up the scroll of heaven 
The days are ended 
The fixed time is passed 
Open the way, I will take the road(Instrumental)(Instrumental)if i had en successor
i would show him what i've done
and show him what were better
so my hate decreased so fast

toxic trap - toxic trap

maybe there is someone
i don't know i need a son
who must pass the things i know
who wants to learn what i can show

toxic trap - toxic trap

shall i investigate
or shall i fuck of
when the sun goes down
my mind is strange enough

toxic trap - toxic trap

slashing till the brake of day
i did my work alone
tn toxic trap i'm prison not aloneI believe it is a politically generated act
When hundreds of civilians entering the scene to execute punishment
Taking a somewhat fascistic solution within a socialist environment
An ambivalence of goals; to make a better world or just spreading a fear?
Creating an instability within a supposedly peaceful neighborhood
Claiming to be the keepers of the \"law\", they search for victims
No tolerance for all the outsiders who live outside the \"rule\"
The use of violence occurs, and ironically it is permittable
There is no such difference between ignorance and hypocrisy
Living in a system where togetherness supremely reigns
To act the same, behave the same
Letting the neighbors become the watcher
Problems of mine are problems of theirs
The biggest concerns: moral issues
Who are they to be the judge for someone who lives next door?
The privacy severedly invaded
Don\'t they know, have they ever realized?
They are as guilty as the ones they judged
Time to reap from worthless seeds(Instrumental)Misunderstood by the mind of mortal men
He soars in a nocturnal night under the moon
His rage set in a burning glance
He's a black power, he's a nighttime hunter

A bat, a black angel of dead
A messenger of dark, a hell's servant
A lifeless body, a pal skin
He's doomed to be immortal forever
He's searching for an innocent mortal body
To quench his infernal thirst
He'll sink his teeth into a tender neck
As to suck off all the blood and then kill

No one can see the reflection of him
You won't meet him in the light of day
But when it's dark he's near
He who has left the crypt to hunt again

So burn his eyes by unnatural glitter
And the fangs between the scarlet lips
The victim of night from ashes has risen
Cognizing the happiness of blood bath
When the dawn comes and again
A bloody-thirsty vampire comes back into the grave
That he wants to continue
His diabolical feast on the next day

And with the sunrise people will find a corpse
Bloodless and torn in the dark of the night
It will be buried comitted to the earth
The given-out origin of lifeI can get the inmost thoughts
Thoughts are hidden safe by
You make me laugh. Enough
What a naive stuff!
I get right into the heart of things at once
I'm clearing up the mist of your reality

Oh, boring life & death
Full knowledge
It may cost you your life
IT MAY COST YOU YOUR LIFE

So tired of your grimace
So disappointed
You've got in my hair with your scrap
How annoying. What a shame
In a word, all your sensations
Are incommensurably poor
As compared to mine
And this fever of emotions is to blame
Tears & joys are just the same

I guess it's fine
You're barren shot
I REALLY MEAN IT
Sick & tired of everything

When I have my bowells open
Then I'll see
Every verge of grace
It's my FANTASYAphaty

Silent misunderstanding
See no hear no what I could know
Ignorent sadness
Selfish reality
Feel no fear no what I've done
Frequent process of aphaty

My dying resistance
Doesn't mean to love difference
Infirmities of old age hunger
Gravitate to horrifying withering
Talk fast 
Fictional coming

From the dusk I'll ascend over agony
To tell the truth and nothing but the true lies
I've been sent from the dawn of supremacy
I'm the cradle of insomnia
The substance 

Physical disorder obeys
Main draft of threatening power
Persuades the fact of beheading

Impudent nazarene
Lashing effect of murder
I slay without compassion

Deep inside my soul

before the stygian foetus(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I cry out to you "Violence!" and will you not save?
Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention rises up.
Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.
Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you.
For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.
They are feared and dreaded. Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.
All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand.
Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it.
Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god.
Aren't you from everlasting, Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have established him to punish.
You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he,
And make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.
Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good.
Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the nations without mercy?

Blood will stain this snow white dove

Why spend it in such a haste?

Take your shot

You'll burn eternally,

Wheezing through tea stained lungs comes a voice piped in from a vacuum 

A tiled grove of telephone wires, rabbit ears and power lines 
Insinuated in the residential disintegration that assassinates the sky

To be shared among us all.

Or do I fall back into place

See what they bring... nothing

It's pathetic and outrageous
How it's gotten so built up and overrated
The whole thing's grown so contagious
When the filth, the filth becomes contaminated

Can't afford to wait any longer
As I'm getting weaker they're
Growing stronger and they believe
In order to succeed you gotta
Have more than fellow man's achieved

Not me
I'm doing just fine wastin' time
Scraping by barely

Like the freight train that's run out of tracks
There's no going forward and turning back
Once again I failed to achieve any of my plans
Once again I returned back to the
Place where I began.God speaks, in forked tongue
Receive, wide open soul

Control, The flow
Watch them follow, watch them die

Control, the flowUsed and abused
Love escapes from you
Lust and greed of men taking over your life

Under the hungry eyes you try to run away
Couldn't hide your sexual appearance

Pain becomes lust
Suffering an everlasting orgy
Found your place in Hell you became a tortured whore

JustineStay alone... in solitude (aeternal),
I wander in a snowly land ( supreme lord of sadness)
A life of battle... in this s wasted land
An almighty supremacy... of hate and death
The glacial wind of madness, is blowing around me,
the darkness is nearer, swallow up reality
A strange, warm light is shining... through the shadows
is glowing in the forest... with his mysteries
An ethereal figure now, it's standing before me
white like the snow, virginal purity
Her eyes, her lips, her skin
unnatural beauty, pale as the moon
My sad, evil heart, id flying to her
beautiful queen of dusk
(Glacial and motionless, as a statue in the snow,
an amguish sense of horror is bustin' into my soul..)
I'll build a temple to protect you from the rain
I'll find fresh blood and make it runnin' in your veins
We will dream together through the enchanted night
In the past I was not, but for you I will be
I'll rip off the wings from an angel to protect you from the cold
I'll find a rose in the snow to offer to your breast
we will dance with the music of thousand cherubs
Everything to save you from the cruel embrace of death
"I journey since the beginning searching for you
you don't know who I am,
but I know what you're looking for
I am Lilith, Queen of the Hell
offer me your blood and we will reign forever"
The rage I feel is like the tide that explode with the full moon
"Hail Satana... in this land of death"
You came into my life like an Angel fallen from the sky
"Ave Satana....embrace your new slave"
I loved you, my sweet, Vampyre.
I want to take my last gaze of you, feelin' a human feeling
In this night, in this terrible night, I'll die,
just to came back... from obscurity beyond the dusk..........A kiss soft like moonlight
On a volcano crater
Unleashed hellfire into my face
Scorching my beard and eyeballs
Merging time, space and matter
There was only the smell of Uranus
There I held the world in a grain of sand
Like the masturbating fish
I abandoned all hope- The Calling of Shammash - 4:67

When skies did darken
It rose upon the breeze
Subdue the earth so violent
With blood upon the breeze
Unto eternal flames
Beyond the darkened seas
Shadows of lore crept
Death upon the breeze
Lucid death did consume entirely this realm upon the name thee malevolent 
ancient Cthulhu. Skies of velvet night therefor uncalled by forms of eternal life 
to the names of the Elders. The ancient ones do consume this plane once 
more and hereby did make slaves of man. As were formed encompassing giant 
shapes of the Ancient ones in praise of the new kings
Dark water turned red with life of men
And all men were pale with fear
Hear them call with pain.. this world will befall
In hopes dormant would awaken.. i lept from chains
Across land i flee.. Daemons do pursue me
Through tunnels i flee.. Ancient cries of the beasts

- In Names of Lore - 5:64 

Fields of battle of the last stand
Great vortex thrust upon me i stumble
Ethereal in terms of mists i walk
Infernally bestowed upon me i fall
Names of lore were stolen from a higher self
Archaic fathers i call to thee to bestow strength
I will swear to you i do display the elder rites
Lore! hear me and do speak through me elder fathers
Do entrust in me oh the fiery throne of Anu i embark
Subversive creation fielding the battle of lord Cthulhu
Story was told unto me through my manifest unwaking 
And i did lash out from chains of slavery of the Ancients
As i spoke the ground did open wide with flame
Cast into frost fire i do recall them empower me
As they spoke i fell deaf upon the world of cold
To the air i rose and did call out names of elders
Know that our years are the years of War!
And our days shall be measured as battles!
Our generation of life may once live again
So that we may be free from their bindings
I shall restore the covenant of ways of the old
I enter the first gate and assail the guardian

- Centuries of War - 1:96

With blood upon the breeze
The war did rage once more
Skies of darkened seas
War upon the breeze
Invoke the silent seas
In a name, a shape and number
Frost of magick fire
Rise from bloodied seas
Lands uncalled i traverse in forms unknown
Through the ethereal vortex once more i lept
As the Ancient onces were unheard of me
I struck out with names of death and blasphemy
Begone masters of death.. Lords of Tiamat i banish!
Absu hear my words i call.. With sorcery of death i call!
Barra! Begone of this realm.. Into the abyss i banish!
Return our home to life.. Exode! Unto the burning Sun!
I am the messenger of those Elder fathers
Eyes of Tiamat did glance upon my Soul
The Ancient ones did surrounded me i did stumble
I stared unto the darkened frost eyes of Tiamat 
They did raise their sorcery up upon me as i fell
As i cried out with blood upon the breeze.. 
Exode!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The axe-weilding madman
The undying corpse
The grasping spectre

As i have grown so has my fear.... The cold in the back of your mind...
The knowing that it is all coming to a very slow and agonizing end
That that feeling is no longer just a shiver but something realized

The grasping spectre
Its petrifying touch
Was how it all began

The night she came to me, in my dark hallowed hall
Like a fogs fading mist she entered my vision
With a cold sweep of her arm lay her hand upon me

Pain filling my ears, i fell to my knees
Blood from my nose, salty to my lips.. Screaming!
Numbing cold penetrating my very entirety
Suddenly she was gone, my mind numb with ((eerie shock!))
Since that cursed night she has often come to me
Sometimes in fear, sometimes in sorrow.. Screaming!
There is no way back, i'm loosing grasp on myself
Madness steps in as sanity's hold begins ((fading to black!))

I sought solace in others.
Those who may help her cease
The compasionate caring friends
A devoted father of the faith
The ever observant brain shrink
They have all failed!

She comes to me at night
Here in my tiny padded cell
The caring compasionate friends
The devote father of faith
The screaming never ends!
They have all failed!

In this sanitarium.. In this jacket
He came to my bed.. I lay strapped
The empty eyes of dementia promise me salvation
Through the pitch forest.. Fleeing the jacket
We run endlessly.. No longer strapped
Through the whipping woods she came to me.

No longer in fear and no longer in sorrow but now filled with rage
I could do not but collapse, in agony and fear
My ears filled with blood, my eyes with white pain
I have nothing more for her.. My mind is shut
Through endless woods i followed my releaser until we could run no more
We stood in the dark, desperately gasping for breath
The moon illuminating, only forms of shadows
He was watching me, intently with a burning gaze

"She is making me do this, she brought us here.. A curse upon your soul!"
The gleam of steal caught my eye
How beautiful it is in the moonlight
"The touch is her curse, foolish bastard!"
It is in his hand
The axe weilding madman
"Die!"
I must flee!

Through woods and whips
Run blind in terror

Quicken your pace
No need for haste
The man behind you
Will hack off your face. (repeat and on the second time sync vocals for last line.)

Death follows closely, with no reluctance, for the work to be, done on this relentless night
The grasping spectre
The axe-weilding madman
Footing gives way, to the wet forest floor, as i grasp for a, hold to right myself and escape
The loathsome spectre
The death weilding madman

One axe to the back
Its relentless attack
The man behind me
Lunatic of her making
Slowly i am set free

As i had grown so has my fear. The cold in the back of your mind
The knowing that it is all coming to a very slow and agonizing end
That that feeling is no longer.. Why will death not set me free

A curse upon my soul
No freedom in death
The undying corpse

There is no release...HE WANTED TO BE LIKE GOD
EXALTING HIMSELF AS MOST HIGH
SIN OF PRIDE MISUSED
CAST OUT OF HEAVEN
GOD SENTENCED LUCIFER
FOR HIS MUTINY
BLIND WITH ANGER HE WAS
CAST OUT OF HEAVEN
A SPECIAL PLACE WAS MADE
FOR HIM AND THE REBEL ANGELS
IT'S KNOWN AS HELL TO MAN
A PLACE RESERVED FOR TORMENT
HE TEMPTED THE LORD IN THE DESERT
BUT MISERABLY FAILED
BLIND WITH ANGER
LIMITED ACCESS TO HEAVEN
HE SENTENCED CHRIST TO DIE
SMILING, SCREAMING, "CRUCIFY"
HE DIDN'T REALIZE
HE ALREADY LOST THE WAR

A SPECIAL PLACE WAS MADE
FOR HIM AND THE REBEL ANGELS
IT'S KNOWN AS HELL TO MAN
A PLACE RESERVED FOR TORMENT

THERE IS A PROPHECY
YET TO PASS
SATAN WILL RISE UP 
TO FIGHT
AGAINST THE LORD AND HIS ARMY
HE'LL LOSE YET ONE LAST TIME
HE DOESN'T REALIZE
HE DOESN'T REALIZE
THAT PLACE IN HELL WE LEARN
SCREAMS GO UNHEARD
ABADDON CAN CRY IN PAIN
FOR BETRAYING THE LORD

A SPECIAL PLACE WAS MADE
FOR HIM AND THE REBEL ANGELS
IT'S KNOWN AS HELL TO MAN
A PLACE RESERVED FOR TORMENT(Instrumental)You crawl to the very top
Yeah, we all saw it
Tell me what it's like for you
I'd love to feel it
'Cause I know what flows through you
It's cold and septic
The dead they flock to you
But they accept it

You've got so much to give
But I'll never see it
You've got enough to break me
And I'll never feel it
You think that before long
That I'll run the knife through
You think that I don't run
I'll fucking show you

I, I've got enough to take
That I am standing in your way
I can lose but I will never break
So dare you come around this time
And back it up
And leave it all behind

You think that I am next
But I'll never show you
You never see yourself
I'd love to make you
'Cause I know what flows through you
It's shit and empty
You think that I don't run
You never break me


10. Your God

Give Him what you want
Go on and get on your knees and pray
Heaven knows I'm right
Heaven knows the things that I might say

Tell me to believe
You tell me everything that I should do
Give Him what you want
Advocate, I'll leave it all to you

Oh - your God, is He always there
to give to you? It just ain't fair
I think I might just need Him now
'Cause I'm so lost this time
Yes I'm so lost this time

Give you what you want
Yeah, I will get on my knees and pray
I'm guessing that you're right
I listen to the words you have to say

Teach me to believe
Teach me to believe the things you do
Heaven knows you're right
Heaven knows it's good enough for you

Oh - your God, is He always there to give to you?
It just ain't fair
I think I might just need Him now
'Cause I'm so lost this time
Yes I'm so lost this time

'Cause I'm so lost this time
Yes I'm so lost this time(Instrumental)Living in denial of me
I'll take control of you
Society will torture your mind
You know not what to do

You can't avoid the monsters
When they're a part of your own soul
Lurking inside the crevice of your mind
Searching for ways to grow

A part of you you fight to repress
Animalistic urge
Live for the beast, the monster inside
For the adrenal surge

You can't avoid the monsters
When they're a part of your own soul
Lurking inside the crevice of your mind
Searching for ways to grow

The monster inside
Will make you feel alive
So just see through its eyes
The monster inside
Wants you to live your life
The way you were designedFairest dusk, your grim onset, 
 Does curve the lips upward and 
 Lift my head Eastern in direction (Divulge) 
 I yearn to bask in the pale light of 
 Your silver, spherical nucleus once again. (Oblige) 

 Delve into my nature... 
 All loathing. 
 Speak my name. 

 The wind chills and in a way comforts me... 
 Knowing there are things colder than I. 

 A plethora of bitterness, I am... 
 The fulcrum which maintains the balance of 
 All things now disputable within, 
 The bacterial body I uphold. 
 A plethora of bitterness, I am... 
 The fulcrum which maintains the balance of 
 All things once disputable within, 
 All celestial bodies. 

 My marks upon this world are miniscule 
 and insignificant. 
 ...And yet I persist with the utmost dilligence. 
 And as these beads of rain trickle down my face, 
 I know soon I will lie beneath the ground I tread. 

 A plethora of bitterness, I am... 
 The fulcrum which maintains the balance of 
 All things now disputable within, 
 The bacterial body I uphold. 
 A plethora of bitterness, I am... 
 The fulcrum which maintains the balance of 
 All things once disputable within, 
 All celestial bodies. 

 From a breath to inanimation, 
 Flourishing to an abrupt dissipation 
 A life of effort sans merit 
 Such is a bitter fruition 

 The wind chills and in a way comforts me... 
 Knowing there are things colder than I. 

 A plethora of bitterness, I am... 
 The fulcrum which maintains the balance of 
 All things now disputable within, 
 The bacterial body I uphold. 
 A plethora of bitterness, I am... 
 The fulcrum which maintains the balance of 
 All things once disputable within, 
 All celestial bodies.We smash the crumbling cross
burn the symbol of the zombie nations
show of might and force
hellfire burning within our veins
satans mark left on our souls
we are the just ones!

we who are not prisoners of the mind
bend to no false words of a desperate god
we are the alien elite
putting the flames to their holy lies
we stand in the flames of enlightenment
our morning star burns their darkned lies!

(pre chorus)
rising from flames
infinite will
spread black wings
destroy your lord!

(solo)(The Call of Cthulu)
Hounds of war.. Cthulu invokes hordes of malice
Call to arms.. Herald of mass legions of upheaval
Ia mass Ssaratu! Beyond the swamps of wandering dead
Cthulu, master of the armies of the ancient ones beckons
The gates are no longer barred, locked and bolted! Keepers of the gates hath been slain upon scarlet swamps. Armies of the ancient ones, dragons of the deep.. Gods of the seas.. 

Iak Kingu, Iak Azag
Iak Azabua, Iak Huwawa
Ishniggarab, Iak Xastur
Insurgence against Marduk
Dragons of the deep! 

Forget not the fate of Absu. First victim of elder discord who hath been lain in empty space.
Once more Hubur arose, she who fashions all things
Compiles matchless weapons to the arsenal of ancient ones.. 

(The Foundation of Death)
Barra Anu!
Bar the gates
Renew its bars
Man the tower
Open the gate
The dead rise
Break its bars
Call to war! 

Summoned are the demons of Hubur
Laying waste upon the temple of Marduk
The viper, the dragon, the winged demon
Bearing weapons of no fear, Kingu shepherds
You come to war Kingu!?
With baneful creation of Hubur
Then you shall fall upon blade
Speak lest you be silenced... 

(Dusk of Eternity)
Armed with disc of power in chariots of fire Marduk came fourth. With a blazing flame he filled his body. Dragons of the seas fell upon the ground and all were slain. Knower of the secret names, shapes and numbers gazed upon the form of Kingu.. With a curse Kingu lashed upon the body of Marduk. 
Striking with disc of power Marduk blinded his eyes of death. The monster heaved and raised its back striking forth in all directions with ancient words of power, screaming ancient incantations. Marduk struck once more and blew an evil wind into its body, filling the wicked beast as then Marduk shot between its jaws the charmed arrow of Enki and struck once more, severing the head of Kingu from its body... The black seas swelling...I am led by the ages of a serpent
Charging my sight in the most distant distance
Guiding my steps in the nearest near
Binding the will...

Who gave the snake its terrifying beauty?
The temptation of the abyss
The sweetness of death
Who gave horror the greatest of passions?
That calls like a darker bliss

There, beyond. At the ever flowing streams
(Where salvation is fire
And darkness can be eternal)
I meet the perditor in his true form

You are God's shadow, evil one
Jah's nocturnal brotherDo I've something to say?
You`re dirty gay
The world is mired in sin
Planet of the apes
But I have a shotgun, look how it shines
Wash up by my shot, rain of salt

Freddie met his Elton
Elton met his George
George is meeting shotgun
Shotgun met his George

The planet of the apes
Let's play in my game
Salt rain for gay
It's Judgment Day

Die

Angels of death will close gays` breath
Shining angels wings will burn all the queers
Swim in the salt lake, dirty ape
Welcome faggot-star in Sodom and Gomorrah

Freddie met his Elton
Elton met his George
All of them met my shotgun
Shotgun met them all(Instrumental)Black robed

Decayed
Plunge in 
Abyss
Slumbered
Arousing

I took the possession
Gasped at each vibration
Condemned of inquisition
Breathlessly stillness
Erred in my calculations
Loud long scream of despair
Tottered upon the brink
Fell fainting into abyss
Fell fainting into abyss
Fell fainting into abyss
Fell fainting into abyss(Instrumental)You cause this treason,
For your own tragedy.
Lets see you all move now.
You try to cope with suicide.
Thats not the way to die.
Your tragedy.
I want to die.
I dont want you to mean nothing to me.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Deperations lead the waking life paranoid and sleep deprived awaiting further visitations for in the distance rings the echo of its calling once again

As this lituus carves into the flesh of the stars, feel my senses devoured by the auspice of sordid revelation(Instrumental)devastating plague devours thousands of lives. Families lie dead in the streets. Lost spirits haunt the city on a mission for eternal rest. What did the legacy of man do to be dealt this disastrous cycle? And when
will the gods cast away this hell spawn contagion? I watch as the sky screams in agony and fire pours from the sun. Bodies melting as if they were wax sculptures. Bodies melting as if they were wax sculptures. The voice in my head gives me a feeling of accountability. Water fills the city as the earth swallows itself. The deafening screams of lost souls drown my emotions. The emptiest sky, flooded with darkness, a sea of bodies. What will become of this deserted planet after all is said and done. In man's last moments of existence all i can wish for is to turn back time. To turn back time. Why couldn't we realize this is all our fault and why was every outspoken voice sentenced to death. GO! The ground that you walk on and the system that so generously grants us life could also be your worst enemy. Your worst enemy!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The irreality of the past, 
Its nonexistence; 
Obscured by reverberations in all directions 
Calling from across the rotting sea 
From an endless desert 
where nothing can grow. 
Smothered by what, in the mind, 
has grown so powerful and unbearable. 
Something so long dead.(Instrumental)You take away my breath with a touch
Everything changes around me
You can unite my fragmented dreams
And turn my grey into colors

Falling for you

There is something in your eyes
That it makes me feel so right
Do you feel the magic in the air tonight

There is something in your heart
Like a shining star you came and saved me
From the dark tonight

You wipe away the sorrow from me
It feels like I am reborn

Calling your name

There is something in your eyes
That it makes me feel so right
Do you feel the magic in the air tonight

There is something in your heart
Like a shining star you came and saved me
From the dark tonight

Feeling alive
Take me away
Hold my hand
And wipe away my sorrowRuling the earth's sad melody 
Ruling the war's violent melody 

The King of the Nature is Shatan 
That doesn't affirm 
Or else to deny 

His chimerical clouds 
Build the sky's fire 
That extinguishes the star of the glory light 

Oh earth, hear those blasphemies 
Because those are blasphemies of your sons 
The divine concience fire 

Oh, Have-Iod 
Oh, Have-Iod 

Oh life, 
You are only illusion 
Go back to your original ashes 

I'm the life, 
The dream's life 
Or the life's dream's 
To me the desolated and full of paindie for me, you worthless
lying machine
leaving you to breathe
would be only another sin

living without you
is the life I can realize
the interspace between us
is like hell from paradiseTake a step away from convention, making up the rules as it goes along; Never content to be classified, always must do what is said is wrong; Cannot fit in with some trendy scene, many are in a scene only to be seen; Every new step unpredictable, into the beyond of what's thought possible; Take a journey into obscurity, freed from all genre made restrictions; Slowed but never stopped by all obstacles, for the love of music it carries on; It's the mirror of all experience, observed from art and life until it's revealed bent; Crafted then mastered and then exposed, recieved then responded and then on it goes....Music is a way of life - best immersed in all the time; Best lived with an open mind - it's all there to be enjoyed; Innovate, originate - makes no sense to replicate; Trends will die while scenes stagnate - so innovate, originate; Take a step away from convention, making up the rules as it goes along; Never content to be classified, always must do what is said is wrong; Cannot fit in with some trendy scene, many are in a scene only to be seen; Every new step unpredictable, into the beyond of what's thought possible; Leave doubters behind - with a positive mind - with a progressive motion - but a stand still in time; Leave doubters behind - with a positive mind - with a progressive motion - but a stand still in time; The first step beyond - with many to come - the first step of a journey - that may never be done....Driving forward at total breakneck speed
Never looking back into the past
Unleash the best upon a reckless world
Filled with pounding fists and crushing hate

Inner violence rising
From hates eternal well
A scathing fury...darkest thoughts arise
No remorse is shown, with no regret at all
There will never be a place for compromise!

Live to die
Can't forgive
Racing forward with the will to live
Fight to survive another day
Cause in the end, there's hell to pay!

Search for a comfort
From pain there's no relief
Errors of the past have been exposed
Justice imposed by unlikely means
Prepare to meet the final destiny

A victim of dishonour
Prolonging certain death
Feeding the grinder with fresh meat!
Releasing pain of nightmares yet intold
Anguish thrust upon eternal souls

Live to die
Can't forgive
Racing forward with the will to live
Fight to survive another day
Cause in the end, there's hell to pay!(Instrumental)Flesh ripped from bone
Hair pulled out in clumps
Body Mangled
Heart Broken
Final breath about to escape
Head hung low in sadness
For they know not what they do
Sentenced To Die
Guilty Of No Crime
Death becoming
Imminent
Not a single bone broken
Heart filled with love
Final Words
They Are Said
It Is Done

Words spin a cynical swing

It's getting cold in inside
While I hear you joking...

You know, some of us are not amused

Nobody's laughing here

What scares the pants off me
Is what you really say

This is the Voice of Doom
This is the Zodiac speaking
And I'm coming for you

Say Hell-o... Scorpio
Say Good Bye... Gemini
This is the Zodiac speaking
Now it's time to die

By fire, by knife, by rope, by gun
Whatever get's it done
If I were an Aries I wouldn't be scary
And this game wouldn't be so much fun

This is the Zodiac speaking
This is the Voice of Doom
This is the Zodiac speaking
I'll see you soonI AM THE TRUTH ABOUT GREAT LONELINESS 
WITHOUT HOPE FOR GOD'S PRAYER 
MY THOUGHTS STRAY ON THE EDGE OF REALITY 
SEARCHING THE WAY LOST IN A FOG 
I AM LIKE A STONE CRASHED TO THE GREY DUST 
LONLEY SOUL LOOKING FOR MISERY 
IT IS THE TIME TO OVER THE GAME 
IT IS THE TIME TO FIND THE WAY TO HEAVEN 

HERE - WHERE WE ARE 
NO ONE HEAR OUR WORDS 
SHADE REFLECTED IN THE WATER 
IT IS MY LONLEY SOUL 
AND IN THE SHADOWS OF DRIED UP TREES 
MY THRONE OF NIGHT IS STANDING 
JUST A SCREAM OF TOLLING BELL 
DESTINY IS CALLING ME MY DESTINY 

BEAUTIFUL WORDS ARE NOT FOR ME 
IT IS NOT MY EXTREME WISH 
I WANT TO BE LONLEY VISION 
IN THE VALLEY OF LOST TIME 
I CAN FIND HERE NEXT SIGNS OF SILENCE 
I WANT TO TEAR OFF MY THROAT WITH SCREAM 
IT IS THE TIME TO GO AWAY 
IT IS THE TIME TO FIND THE WAY TO HEAVENLife is so good
Luck comes to greet
Those who found their way through crooked streets

I lost my way
Drawn misery and decay
And now I'm here I can't turn back

Thus fucking place exudes
A stench of greed and hate so foul
The vomit lies about me all around

So here we are,
Is this what you thought?
'Cos I expected something more

I followed all my dreams
Believed in foolish things
Learn not to follow, not to trust

Farewell to pain and fuck the world
If this is life, can't wait to die

Here is pain I can't handle life
Misery follow me let's just fucking die
Slash my veins, stretch my neck
I feel trigger-happy for my headHectic way of life
Machines and computers make our brains blocked
Let's get back to nature
Let's get back to our lifes.
Rediscover love, let's go to paradise
It's fast breeding, it's fast growing
That's fast extinction of brain.
Breeding, growing - dying
Clothings and properties
turn us into enemies.
Is there anything to envy
on a naked human body?
We destroy everything around us
only for our own mammon
Stop - let's get back up in the trees!
Back to human being
Let's get back to nature
Back to human lifes.
It's fast breeding, it's fast growing
That's fast extinction of brain.
Breeding, growing - dyingYour life is a myth
Brought forth by insanity's creator
But you can't resist
The lies you have been told
The world is nothing
Random accidents-mixed up with disorder
Your "soul" fulfills the ancient ignorance
Of life eternal-a cliched prophecy
Close your eyes to the light
Endure the bitter cold
Enslaved by your God
Conform to their hold
Shed blood of the ages
Hypocrisy unbound
The innocent left to rot
Beneath your Holy ground
Desolate, mindless thoughts
Kill the sound
Emptiness in your breath
Whispering
Lonely hearts, life has no mercy
Bury me
You're just a spec, one in a million
Filling space
Life
Has
No
Place...
Symbolic of nothing more...
Create your myth...
Sculpt the lies...
Evolve and be left behind...
Your thoughts are supposed to be advanced
But you resort back to your old ways
Absorb the abstract thoughts
Of inane drivel
You narrow-minded hypocrite
See the err of your claims
Force upon me your corrupt methods
Of campfire folklore
Rot in the soil
Bathe in the dirt
Unconciousness
Immersed in the black!Appari, sparisci 
Nei temporali elettrici 
Sei un grembo e una bara 

Occhi cerchiati 
Volti segnati 
Cuori spezzati 

VegliamoSenseless life
The pretenders
Among the living
Pure lies

Have never been
The slightly fair games
Now it is the time
To avenge

The underdogs
the real truth
to wake you
from your dreams

Destroy the crowns
Behold the fires
As I am your resume
For you to stay alive

Time to think
The agony you had embraced
to my heart, at a glance

How can you
Survive with your
stupidity encircles you

Like a lamb
Waiting to be chopped

And wasted...(Instrumental)The first thing I saw...
Was a shadow of an evil sight
That was not all...
There was a growl which gave me a fright

Should I scream and call...
But what for, no ones out in the night
I would not fall...
Through my faith, I chose to fight

My choice was wrong...
Satan's power was stronger than mine
Demons strapped me down...
They slashed and tore my guts to drink with wine

Evil prophecies foretold
The day shall come, escape for none

Doomed to Death and Damned in Hell
Nothing left for me to tell
Doomed to Death and Damned in Hell

Now i burn in Hell
There's no escape, doomed for good
No more to tell...
This is the end, it's understoodShadows dancing all around
Shadows dancing all around
My world crumbles to the ground
A new condition, I'm looking for 
But still I drift away from shore
My world crumbles to the ground
A new condition, I'm looking for 

Long I have seen, occurring dreams
Crouched and obscene, stalking enemies 
See their eyes
Long have I heard thunderous the words 
Of the absurd, tangled and perverse
Hear their lies
Long have I dreamed of what I have seen 
Spawned from disease we can feel the carven bones 
Beneath our hides

Growing potential is shaping disorder behold the power
Welcome the lost screaming in madness my name you whisper
Take a deep breath the battle ahead is not over
Destroying what's left cheating our death we are rebornLack of purpose brought me to this,
Temporary conclusion
A solution to satisfy my needs
And convince me to go on
Again it starts to repeat itself, becomes an unmoving routine
Again it brought back to ask again: why am I
Here 

Never in me forever
This will be my eternity
An unmoving routine
Repeating it self
Hide
Never within the lines
Never in me
Forever and always
This will be mine 

Convinced that my true purpose is
Not exactly what I had in mind
I need a clear new destination
A new state of mind
A new state of mind 

Never in me forever
This will be my eternity
An unmoving routine
Repeating it self
Hide
Never within the lines
Never in me
Forever and always
This will be mine
This will be mine
Forever this will be mine

Marduk stirs and opens his eyes...
All is calm as the dark waters rise...

"Stoop not down, therefore,

Ever espousing a body unluminous

The way we act among ourselves is changing drastically. 
Some cling desperately to the old, some move on forward, and some move around 
in the in-between area, disconnected from the flock. 

We are corroding our stereotypes, we are changing our society, as we always have. 
It's a journey beyond any other that we will truly experience but sadly we will always be forced to only see

Corrosive Blood flows from a bleeding Head
A Viking's Grave can only be found in the Sea
A Man stands in the Ocean of self Discovery
These Waters are not for the human Eye
For it's the Ocean beneath the gold northern Sky
How could I forget the Serenade of Rotting Flesh
I kneel down in these Waters, over me Waves crash

Look at what Nature can provide but Man
Is destroying her by letting their Machines eat up the Riverside
The Rivers, The Streams, are turning Black
And the Magic of Life, they begin to lack 
Man and Creature sip the now poisoned Nectar
Industry's Residue make these Waters black as Tar
Industry now kills everything
Northern Animals suffer from Man's Greed
Now look at the special Ocean, it's beginning to bleed

Looking into the Horizon
Industry has risen
For Man will kill
For who will fix and mend
For many lie dead
Where the River flows end

Nobody can replace what is lost, no more singing Birds
No more Fish to pick at my Skin as I kneel in the Water
Or to jump out the Water into the Air to catch Mosquitos in Flight
There is not even a Mosquito to bite me for they are all dead
I myself feel weak and sick, as I bury Nature's fallen Creations
Dead has a new Form and it is Man, look into his eyes and what do you see

It's Man......since I was a child, I saw my own way.
and god was not a part of it.

I am so sick of hearing your preach about heaven

For many an age Lucifer traversed as measured by the time of mortal beasts
Of many centuries hell's denizens raged and awaited their lords return to them..
Before the gates of hell stood Lucifer once more
Solitary angel.. Released of Elder dimensions 

Open the gates
Lord of chaos
Return to hell
Reclaim your throne 

With a roar that shook the earth to its foundation.. He returned. 

"Hear me baleful spirits for i hath returned from places unknown to gods and men
I hath traversed upon time as i have fallen between spaces unto dimensions of gods!
Impetuous Deities! Our time is soon at hand my sons of chaos... The rivers of his rule have run dry!
We shall assail heaven with a fury unknown to this world of fools and lies... God must die!" 

(Plea of the Father)
"Michael, our time is at hand.. Those stricken from heaven have released vengeance that no creation of mine doing may expulse from our dimension... our time is at an end...." 

With such notification Michael rose up
and journeyed far from the eyes of god 
Upon the world of man he journeyed 
and with fear and hatred lashed upon creation
Renting the lands with blood of the sinful
He came upon thought of hell and death
Lucifer must be stricken with death
I must journey.. 

Through darkness fell the archangel..
Upon lake of pyre he emerged with loathing........
Solemnly he journeyed before the throne of Lucifer and asked of talks with his former angelic host. To which Lucifer granted him 5 breaths of life before he would be stricken dead..
Speaking of the end times he warned Lucifer he hath not idea of which he was to unleash upon this world.. With a grin lucifer looked upon Michael begged of his keep in hell and upon denial smote gods messenger with sword, removing him of his head.. 

(Declaration of Destruction)
Assail the Skies!
With a great wind hell grew darker
Its denizens stride trembling the land
Unto the air they took
Flocking the skies with black
With great clash the angels of god lashed upon the skies 
As dark and light came to meet, infinity became undone. Hear my Call!
As with such a force that light became rendered as dark
As god's host of angels fell unto dust in the winds...
Great was this moment of destruction upon the eyes of Lucifer
Forgotten allies falling unto ash in the name of his impending destruction. With eyes of disease he pointed upon the throne of god... 

"So it has come to pass former angel. Your hatred hath consumed your soul. 
So it must be. Turn your liege upon me and end all things..." 

God hath been silenced..
God is Dead! With such news a noise rebounded through the heavens that none should ever have forgotten.. The Zonei and their ancient gods have cleansed the throne of god and such misaligned creation.. "I shall claim the throne of heaven for my own!" proclaimed Lucifer as he must.. All things shall be made.. As now my eye turns towards the world of men.. 

(Dormant with contemplation)
Quietly Cthulu sits in wait
Quietly Marduk sits in wait
Thence in heaven Satan sits.....
Upon the world a darkness crept until all the lands were concealed
The sun no longer lightened the day as the moon ruled the sky
No longer would the almighty father extend rule from the heavens 
Under his watchful gaze all chaos must ensue creation of havoc
As lowly in the shadows they watch and they wait in antipathy
Eyes all focus and gaze upon throne and earth.. In rule of all
Shemhamforash! Hounds of Satan reviled.. Ever purposeful kings..
Spirit of the moon remember.. From the pits of ancient holocausts!We hail downfall
We hail black rain

Black rain fall downFasten the strap-on!
Time to gang-fuck the enemy in every fucking orifice!
You feel satisfaction
As your cannon reaches climax!No further offerings of our own flesh and bone, the stranger found in pieces on shore, has limbs to spare, and can grow more 

A sign, an omen, a living totem, a walking fountain of meat. 
Asteroidian limbs grow again and again, pleasing the pool of teeth 

Sacrifice anew of fresh sinew, his scent sinking like teeth in soup 
Sentries arise from the halocline 

Water will flow from elder to embryo, the driest of days are days of old, 
Bring every bowl, fetch every pail, cup thy hands both dry and frail 

We'll all be drunk with water again 

When we've regaled the demons enough, bring our gift back up 
And feed him well with the oiliest slop 

Yank the rope and hoist him high, he'll regenerate overnight 
When fins follow, let him dropDO YOU REMEMBER ME MY STAINED GLASSLIKE VISION?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE FROM? A NIGHTMARE APPARITION
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR LOVE, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SYMPATHY
I ONLY OWE YOU NOTHING, I ONLY OWE YOU KISS, A BITTERSWEET KISS

THIS AIN'T THE FIRST TIME AND WON'T BE THE LAST
THAT I'M TRYING HARD TO FORGET ABOUT THE DEMONS OF THE PAST
THE WORLD'S CRUEL BEAUTY IS THE CRITERIA OF THE MAN
CRIME OF PASSION IS STILL A CRIME, AN OFFENDER BEING WORTH NOT A DIME

DO YOU RECALL THE SMELL OF THE TIME OF SAFETY AND WARMTH?
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND THE TOUCH OF DEATH'S HAND COLD?
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR MEMORY, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR REST
I ONLY OWE YOU NOTHING, I ONLY OWE YOU KISS, A BITTERSWEET KISS

THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME AND I'M SURE IT WILL BE THE LAST
THAT I'M FEELING THIS WAY, NOW I'M KILLING OFF THE PAST
INSIDIOUS EMOTION GROWING FOR YEARS AND YEARS
PALE LOOK, COLD HAND, WE'RE THE ONES WITHOUT A NAME(Instrumental)Emptiness and laziness
It's the next new generation
Interested about nothing
That's minds defecation
Valorous fighters and hunters
Defended countries with hands
The great fishermen and seafarers
With knowledge of sea, sky and earth

Their wasted sons from western culture
Are drowning in alcohol and dope
They buy meals from bloody fast foods
And each Sunday go to church
The listening of truthless rap
They believe in this bull crap
And next make stupid gangs
Which ruins their lives and things

Emptiness and laziness
It's the next new generation
Interested about nothing
That's minds defecation
Naive chiefs and craven cowards
Trade their ground for dirty dollars
Maori gods are storming in the skies
Young Maori guys, they never pay no mind
The legend of Aotearoa is entombed in dust
The ghost of their culture is losing in the duskYour words. 
They sound so mellow. 
You build worlds. 
But you tear them down. 
You paint blue skies. 
But you burn them down. 
Your songs. 
They sound so mellow. 

I hear your words. 
Loud and clear. 
I can see 
between the lines. 

But which is the truth? 
And what is lies? 

Where is the truth that you promise? 
Where is the dawn that you foresee? 
Look! 
Look inside you! 
Nothingness. Emptiness. Eternal void. 

Chaos is all you crave. 
No progress. No future. 
People kneeling for fake gods. 
People living under misery. 
Look! Look inside you! 

Someone got himself crucified. 
For our fictitious sins. 
He had promised eternal salvation. 
And he became a symbol of a messiah. 
He is a hypocrite! He is a fool! 
Deny him! Listen to me! 
Deny every god! Deny them! 
Deny everything! 

My will is for something else. 
The new age will be different. 
My revolution comes. 
And my kingdom will not be of this world. 

Salvation is a big circle 
and this circle must close. 
Around its lines, 
the abyss lurks. 
One wrong step 
and you are lost. 
You must walk on thin air 
Like an acrobat. 
Else... the void consumes you. 
You have to look the abyss in the eye 
Do not be afraid. 
Do not be afraid of the darkness. 
Do not be attracted by the light. 

This salvation is a big circle 
and this circle must close. 
For salvation you must discover truth. 
Your own personal truth. 
Discover it. Then reach it. 
By then the abyss will not mean a thing. 
You will be superior. 
You will be free. 

What is the form of my abyss? 
Which is my own truth? 

And all those pitiful martyrs. 
Their memory is now long gone. 
Flames burned their faces. 
Searching for eternal forgiveness, 
Their bodies now rot in pits. 

You! Embrace the sun! 
Everything melts but your body. 
You will be saved. 
You wear a crown of a billion stars. 
You hold infinity in your hands. 

You! Yes you! 
Me? I will not perish too! 
I will not fall into the abyss. 
My truth shines. 
So, I will march ahead. 
To the end of the world! And beyond! 
To the end of time! And beyond! 
To the end of the Cosmos! And beyond!They are like riders in raging storm
Like ancient sailors fighting round at Cape Hoorn
They search the danger that's the sense of their lives
Wake up they're coming just with overdrive.

You must believe in darkness
Or it rapes your life away
Got to trust in darkness
Or it rapes your friends away
It will let you down
Turns your neck around
Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain

(Chorus)
Champagne! (Believe in darkness)
Champagne! (Believe in darkness)

Now it is morning and you take a deep breath
And you're just feeling as if you're sentenced to death
But what a pity that you're living still
So now it's time for something to kill

You must believe in darkness
Or it rapes your life away
Got to trust in darkness
Or it rapes your mind away
It will let you down
Turns your neck around
Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain

(Chorus)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)

It will bring you down
turns your neck around

Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain

(Chorus)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)

We are like riders in a raging storm
like ancient sailors fighting round at Cape Hoorn
We search the danger if we're playing here
We'd like to thank you for your grateful cheers

You must believe in darkness
Or it rapes your life away
Got to trust in darkness
Or it rapes your mind away

It will let you down
Turns your neck around
Shows no mercy to
The one who will reject its old domain.

(Chorus)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)
Champagne! (Will be your nightmare)Banished for a reason of State.
...There was no place for all over there.
We built much because much was the emptiness around us.
That gap has never been filled...

A steady Theme in my mind.

Thousands of humans walk into a giant meat machine, once built to grind animals. Now used to produce the finest, mashed human meat.

Men chopped in half, sliced into tiny pieces, a mighty press squeezes the flesh into food cans.

Women are driven into milk factories, embeeded into tiny cages, plugged onto milk machines, to feed the greedy cats. All for the glory and maintenance of the cat race. All for the glory and maintenance of the cat race.

Those who are lucky enough not to be part of the food production serve the cats as slaves. Feeding and brushing them 24 till they die of exhaustion or deportation.

What it felt like having fun
I want you to take my hand
And try and make me understand

Shattered glass from a broken home
now you feel left all alone
I'm trying hard to understand
Why you wanna live with this man

I will do anything I can to make you smile again

Picking up the pieces of a broken life
Never againg will he abuse his wife
She wakes up screaming nightmares remembering
Still she cries out his name 'cuz she would do anything for him

Now your bruises are healing
But your mind's still a mess
And Living under terror
Becomes a lifestyle I guess

I will do anything I can to make you smile again

Picking up the pieces of a broken life
Never againg will he abuse his wife
She wakes up screaming nightmares remembering
Still she cries out his name 'cuz she would do anything for himI die. Where will i go when i die? We'll i'll tell you where the hell i'd like to be. Where will i go when i die? I've entered the darkest place i've ever bin, filled with fossils of my sins. Petrified i've risen we'll beyond my means, struck by the darkness holy light. Could these cave paintings be right, guide my hand to blade and march me off to die. Did my time in this earthly rubble, killed more men than i care to trouble. Feel this shrinking noose of guilt tied around my neck, i wage a war on myself. They've put me here in a cell, the padded walls feel like hell. If i was cured could they even tell. Right here in a frozen world, born to bleed just like me. Stand in line and wait to die, washed away on that dark day. Food for thought or so we thought, pissed away that bitter taste soldiers hands covered in wine. Who's to say their out of line? Flash of red now your dead, face that facts your maker said. In the ground you keep your lies. Spread the ash in misbelief toss away your empty grief and one of these days we all must depart. What the hell are we fighting for? On and on the blackleaf grows, up and down in perfect rows. Symmetry is for the dead, know one knows how long we have left so. Right here in a frozen world, born to bleed just like me. Stand in line and wait to die, washed away on that dark day. Food for thought or so we thought, pissed away that bitter taste soldiers hands covered in wine. Who's to say their out of line? Flash of red now your dead, face that facts your maker said. In the ground you keep your lies. Spread the ash in misbelief toss away your empty grief and one of these days we all must depart. Understand words are said deals are made and don't forget, you own the world but not your soul! The troubles we've had in taming your soul, i don't know where, where else i would go. My life has much to bare, my life is full of woe. The wrath of god they fear, and it has never shown and it will never show! Understand words are said deals are made and don't forget, you own the world but not your soul that belongs to the devils you know! I held his golden axe, lost in fields of blood i relapsed. Turned into this hate machine, murder killing raping. Held this gun up to my head, pulled the trigger as i am dead. Smoking barrels waved goodbye. I've entered the darkest place i've ever bin, filled with fossils of my sins. Petrified i've risen we'll beyond my means, struck by the darkness holy light. Could these cave paintings be right, guide my hand to blade and march me off to die.slow - sorrow has taken control
shadows are approaching me
a torture that no one can tell
is taking possession of me

show me the way to hell

slow down the speed of this game

now and then
the torture seems to never end
go insane
will this torture bring my inner strength?

now a shadow has darken the sun
I'm starting a silent run

I'm not Guilty
Set Me Free. Not Guilty
I'm not GuiltyThe party's kicking off, everyone is over there 
You came on your own, you clearly don't care 
What anybody thinks, or what you like to drink 
By the end of the night you'll be praying to the sink 
Mouth wide open 20 beers in your brain 
Falling on the floor, downing trampagne 
Smashing through walls and stomping down stairs 
Let's rip this place apart let's see who dares 

Case of beer in your hand 
Mischief in your mind 
Anybody in your way 
Will surely fucking die 

Been drinking your way to an early grave 
Supping that shit, a white cider slave 
Hitting on every girl that walks into this place 
Her boyfriend says 
Fuck off or I'll kick you in the face
Grab another bottle and swill it down your neck 
Get up to take a piss and hit the fucking deck 
So much booze is running through your veins 
Foaming at the mouth, about to go insane 
Police have crashed in, through the front door 
Bowl of vodka jelly smashed on the floor 
Vacant mindless stare legs are giving way 
Words are in your mouth but they can't fucking spray 
Vision goes red, blood pouring down 
Mace and bloody truncheon, beaten to the ground 
You may have won the war but there's no need to hate 
Cause all I wanna do is drink, thrash and skate

Spread for all to see
Pills, pills, so many pills

Death, death, so much death
Seen by none but me

Pills and tears and pain and death
In me, for all to see
Dreaded, painful, peaceful death
Ignored by all but me

The pills give me my means of death
The tears for a life to cease
The pain for no one caring enough
And death to bring me peace.(Instrumental)Rigidly perpetuated unawares

Possessive nature of the mutual farce that is harmony battery 

Denounce our repression or save face?I see a red door and I want it painted black
 No colors anymore I want them to turn black
 I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
 I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

 I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
 With flowers and my love both never to come back
 I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
 Like a new born baby it just happens every day

 I look inside myself and see my heart is black
 I see my red door and must have it painted black
 Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
 It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

 No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
 I could not foresee this thing happening to you

 If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
 My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

 I see a red door and I want it painted black
 No colors anymore I want them to turn black
 I see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes
 I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

 I wanna see it tainted, tainted black
 Black as night, black as coal
 I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
 I wanna see it tainted, tainted, tainted, tainted black

Prepare the blue fire

Blessed is this world with plagues 
Named my love, your hate 
Blessed is this world with plagues 
Named you and me 

Can't find the way

Can't chase your stare 
Burning me, as you leave 

Blessed is this world with plagues

Blessed is this world with plagues 
Abandoning each and every thing 

What can I do for myself 
If there's not really much to do 
A new life, a new beginning 
... our most common failure 

Can't find the way 
Burning you, as I cease 
Can't chase your stare 
Burning me, as you leaveEverything I build I destroy,
everything I love always hurts,
everything I hate I'd rather love,
everything I am is everything im not. 

How does it feel to be free,
how does it feel to clearly see,
I am you now, I feel complete,
I am you now, free of defeat.(Instrumental)Moo, moo!

Cow go moo, when they poo,

I milk my cows.

Moo!

Tractor!

I am a farmer, moo!

Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number. It's number is six hundred and sixty six."

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see?, can I believe that what I saw
that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cos in my dreams it's always there the evil face
That twists my mind and brings me to despair

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?
666, the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
666, the number of the Beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerise me... can't avoid their eyes
666, the number of the Beast
666, the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return!
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force!
I have the power to make my evil take its courseFlyin' through space
Enslavin' disciples
In fire and terror I ride
Millenniums of wars
I spread among brothers
Their death's my honour and pride!

Come praise my name
Kill in my temples
I'm bringer of famine and fire
Dark ancient curses
Burn in my hands
Kneel at my altars or die!

Here I have come
To rot down your worlds
Your death and fears are my life...
Ares' my name,
Lord of all wars,
I prosper and laugh as you cry!

I send you my storms
Progeny obscure
Flood of violence and pain
Deimos and Phobos,
Black angels of death
Damnation you can't escape!

Wargreed
Devastation on your nations
Wargreed, on your knees
Here I come in flames

I reign to fight, the god of war
You run and die, it's time for you to fall
Can't stop me'n'my evil rise
Cry and scream, you burn alive

You know it's time to die

I rise from the abyss of time
To twist and take over your minds
I've come to plant my rotten seed
Now kneel down to my...

Wargreed
Obliteration of your nations
Wargreed, on your knees
Here I come in flames

I reign to fight, the god of war
You run and die, it's time for you to fall
Can't stop me'n'my evil rise
Cry and scream, you burn alive

You know it's time to dieHere we stand 
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two 
Sleepless nights, losing ground 
I'm reachin' for you, you, you 

Feelin' that it's gone 
Can change your mind 
If we can't go on 
To survive the tide love divides 

Someday love will find you 
Break those chains that bind you 
One night will remind you 
How we touched and went our separate ways 
If he ever hurts you 
True love won't desert you 
You know I still love you 
Though we touched and went our separate ways 

Troubled times 
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain 
Distant eyes 
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, vain 

If you must go, I wish you love 
You'll never walk alone 
Take care my love 
Miss you love 

Someday love will find you 
Break those chains that bind you 
One night will remind you 
How we touched and went our separate ways 
If he ever hurts you 
True love won't desert you 
You know I still love you 
Though we touched and went our separate ways 

Someday love will find you 
Break those chains that bind you 
One night will remind you 
If he ever hurts you 
True love won't desert you 
You know I still love you 
Though we touched and went our separate waysAwaiting the lord's recapulation of pas
days. Angels escorting to what is
believed to be the final resting place.
A lifetime of speculation about to be
realised. An unexpected revelation
from a god who's words have not
known discordance. Contemplation
perverts my image of eternity.

Forgotten texts, denied by the church,
speak the truth. Only the dead now
know the messenger. Excommunicated,
the flock now moves blind east, out
of my kingdom. Due to our denial of
the saint, all now shall suffer the fate
sentenced to me. Scalding winds of
pain encircling in tormet everlasting
shall be.

Nothing else 
Just Me 

No one here 
Just Me 

Nothing else 
But Me...Walking away now, taking your time, dreaming in circles
Finding your place now, once on the line searching for your well
Now that the doors been closed, I felt my shelter burning
I have no way now of getting back home, I'm finding the meaning now
She became the answer, she became the fire, her new world is burning
An old flame to you, a long road to you
Painful enchanter, naked and blind, sighing for warfare
Patron and dancer, can't seem to find, fighting for nowhere
Blaming your needs inside, minding the storm you churn to
I have no way of fighting your fight, that's something you must do
Walking away now, taking my time, dreaming in circles
Finding this place now, searching within, love is the answer
Starving the pain inside, I found my peace without you
I have a way now, of blessing this home miracles shine through nowC'mon boy --- headed to meet your maker
on a windswept field of glory --- in this Shenandoah Valley
the volleys sound --- the skies went black
the cannons blaze --- with a thunderous crack
if blood was money --- the soil would be wealthy

FROM THE KILLING FIELDS...
for their company --- they died
young men --- young lives
order arms --- they call
for their country --- they fall
...TO THE ROLLING HILLS
AT APPOMATTOX

step up boy --- gonna see your brother
across that field of glory --- in the Shenandoah Valley
gunshots smash --- the morning air
the ghosts of Dixie --- march on young man
when the nighttime falls --- a mothers sons will be lost

FROM THE KILLING FIELDS...

OF WILMER'S PARLOR

"On our part not a sound of trumpet more,
Nor roll of drum; not a cheer, nor word
nor whisper of vain glorying, nor motion
of man standing again at the order, but an awed
stillness rather, and breath holding, as if it were
the passing of the dead!" ***

salute boy --- all the king's men
don't know why we do it --- never owned another man
bow their heads --- pray to die
marching home --- side by side

*** Excerpt from a letter by Joshua L. ChamberlinSleeping deep down behind your eyes
I'm the thing who mortifies the mind
Waking p a chaos you've never known
Saturate you with millions (of) insane thoughts

Listen to my voice
An immortal obsession
No more lucidity inside you
I consume your life

I fade your senses and take the control
I guide you through an ultimate carnage

Welcome to hell !

I hope you enjoy scattering bodies
Spewing blood and piecesof bone
Kill and kill again !!!

I'm inside each human being
Waiting (for) the best moment to appear
Make you reach the point of no return
But you don't care
Now I'm you...

...cause you're deadCOLD AND GLOOM

(music by Vadim Nikolaev; lyrics by Alex Pishikin)

gloom's swallowed up
 the ruins of houses
 thick layer of ashes
 has covered the plains
 the rivers Are ice-bound
 for ever
 death's turned the planet
 into a desert

and  nothing remains
 but cold and gloom
 and  nothing remains
 just cold and gloom

lifeless city shows
 black in the distance
 walls are soaked with
 smell of putrefaction
 dead bodies not committed
 to the earth
 don't release the souls
 confined inside them

cruelly and inexorably
 time obliterates
 the remains 
 of former greatness
 and  nothing remains
 but cold and gloom
 and  nothing remains
 just  cold and gloom

and  nothing remains
 but cold and gloom
 and  nothing remains
 just cold and gloomAs unknown forces colonized
The earth. mankind lived for a
Long time in darkness. today it
Will begin again. and humanity
Will be buried in past, by an
Eternal war. the whole
Humanity will die by the
Soldiers of that unknown force
Unleashed from beyond they
Will cut human beings, in small
Pieces, without mercy. blood is
Flowing everywhere, they like
To smell the odor of burned
Human flesh. destroying
Without mercy, humanity. with
Killing, technology. bloodshed,
Right in your face. seas of blood
Submerged from mankind,
Recovers the earth, at never
Destroying without mercy,
Humanity. with killing,
Technology. bloodshed,... seas
Of blood submerged from
Mankind, recovers the earth, at
Never. destroying without
Mercy, humanity. with killing
Technology. bloodshed, right in
Your face(I) welcome the season shaped in black 
(Soul blinded), eyes not seeing anymore 
Where have all these tears gone 
Where have YOU gone, and where am I? 

Won't you let me see you 
Once again, naked in despair 
Won't you let me touch you 
Once again, withered in disgrace 

Nothing but imaginary pain 
The one I suffer each my single day 
Nothing but your empty words 
The ones you proved with lies 

The morning we have never seen 
The evening we bereaved 
Encircled in a distant flame 
Death became our (longing and) belief 

As days are passing by 
Night is getting closer 
Yes, this is but our time 
The end we've dreamt of 

Nothing but imaginary pain 
The one I suffer each my single day 
Nothing but your empty words 
The ones you proved with lies 

Craving was you for the blood of mine... 
... what was it, hidden deep inside your heart 
Nothing but most anxious aim 
... wasn't it a perfect love?(Instrumental)Grave - of this revolution. Day - when the eagles fall. Ashes - still glow in the desert. Justice - taken from the hands of a warrior. My voice tries to create the call, empty echo is its only friend. No sword or axe is gleaming in these fires of revenge. Tied - are our weapon arms. Died - have our legions of truth. Still - our heart pounds in anger. Will - breathing through this opression!Once again life has hit me on the face,
how I've managed to escape,
looking at the positive side.

The respect you've been given is the one that you've earnt,
over and over again.
Your eyes are open, but you still can't see,
your ears are decaying but you still can't scream,
don't waste my time...DON'T WASTE MY TIME!

Unconciousness...blurred vision and sight,
winning or losing, staying or going, no reason to fight.....
It was all a pack of lies,
It was all a pack of lies...it was all a pack of lies....!(Instrumental)See a young girl strolling down the dusty road
Looks so pretty but her heart is frozen cold
She has lost her friend - a love affair again
But there was no one who could win

And a lonely boy cries his old girl behind
He can't realize no reason and no rhyme
He doesn't know how he could win his lady back
Because she's a member of the pack

Where is the one who plays his melody
A god-blessed heart but still he cannot see
For looking forward needs a lot of time
And a golden heart for him to shine

This is the story so far without an end
He had no address for his love to send
He made up his mind for him results to find
But every answer in his mind

Hearts as cold as ice to satisfy themselves
Ain't no good things and they bring your heart to hell
They can hurt you twice, so many times again
And I know you cannot win

Where is the one who plays his melody
A god-blessed heart but still he cannot see
For looking forward needs a lot of time
And a golden heart for him to shine

So you must look ahead and you must believe in this
Or you'll be so fooled instead, so much that you miss
And the game goes on it always has its place in time
And the search goes on a golden heart to find(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Future Combat Systems: The biggest military contract in U.S. history.
Search! Target! Hunt! Kill! As their intelligence grows, so does their autonomy.
Leaving us at the will of killer machinery! Robots killing humans!Bitterness holds on to me with cruel hands
eating all forgiveness, burning all the bridges
I have crossed to find the way
And, Lord, I know I went astray 
All is lost, all is gone, emptiness dawns on me

The Mass Graves

Silence is what I began to fear most of all
eating all my self-importance, all the
pretentious fucking things I thought I had to say
Oh, Lord, I know I went astray

The howling, the gnashing of teeth!

Hear the darkside call my soul to the mass graves

Summon all strength with the will to atone and
despair be both vice and the punishing, tormenting stone
Vengeance is mine says the Lord in his wrath
and his mercy is great but so terribly narrow the pathFood and board provided for
What more could you need than
Safety of the walls
Gold, gold, gold, in the
Gold, deep in the river
Safe from hostile frontier
In here, out there what will
Keep you warm
Gold, gold, gold, in the
Gold, deep in the river
Because when the gangrene sets in
Who will save your life and limb

Pyrite is all you'll find 
A perfect treasure for fools

Look past your nose see what
Was here before your mind
Was clouded with
Gold, gold, gold, in the
Gold, deep in the river
Tear down your walls and I will
Rebuild this fort using only
Gold, gold, gold, in the
Gold, deep in the river
How can one man plow these
Fields with only memories

They ate all m bread and drank all my ale
The pissed in my beds and shit in my well
My supply rooms are full of empty cans
A fort brimming with ghosts and one tired old man

Abandoning their posts, where has everybody gone
Search of promises of gold
Pondering the ghosts, where has everybody gone
Search for promises of gold

Pyrite is all you'll find 
A perfect treasure for fools

I know you know

Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing	 
Memory and desire, stirring	 
Dull roots with spring rain.	 
Winter kept us warm, covering

Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow
Feeding a little life with dried tubers.	 

...and go south in the winter.	 
 
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow	 
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,	  
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only	 
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,	 
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,	 
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only	 
There is shadow under this red rock,	  
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),	 
And I will show you something different from either	 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you	 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;	 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.	  

....I could not speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither	 
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,	  
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.	 

....Under the brown fog of a winter dawnAll that is there in unearthly void cannot be harnessed or taken controll of or destroyed.
Swirling pools of dust within dust form all that there is when all is aligned.
Infant, heaven, open chasm, womb to creation.
Webs of action on reaction, random connections.
When the bodies align.
Lifeblood to all, the chaos controlled, is unknown to beings who reside in frontiers so old.
Broken connections and meaningless ties spell out the nature of the universe.
Infant, heaven, open chasm, womb to creation.
Webs of action on reaction, random connections.
Vacancy cold, unforgiving void, gives meaning to no star or galaxy or planetoid.
Making no rules, but what is observed.
Heeding no reason when bodies alignMmmManifestation over life outbursts in a pathetic little being
Who is king to all over all!
Flesh is meat and it's goddamn right
You just need to get used to that sight
What the fuck is wrong with humankind?
Sing-a-long of GORE it's all about GORE
Once again this shit's death metal
In the end who cares piss-stream worldwide
There's nothing to save anyway
Now capture your moment and pray of prey
Hypocrisy be thy name!
Go on buy shit with shit on shit
And celebrate the human decay

Celebrate the human decay!

What the fuck?!
Ain't huggin' trees enough?
Oh my god!!!

Devil stole my intentions but that's okay you see
He really is a good guy at least compared to me
Millennium came and we're still here that kinda bothers me
The sickest survive and leeches reign that's nature's choice indeed

No more bloodbath erection
And music's just a bad excuse
Peek of progress is a blueprint of GOD
But who's to take that glory
Paint the numbers 666 and act your way to the top

Malignant utopia transparently fucked up!
Going faster killing spree and entertainment it's GORE
Facts are for the weak and we are not in need
Scent of war is miserable but how I long the flesh

Celebrate the human decay!

What the fuck?!
Ain't huggin' trees enough?
Oh my god!!!MY LIFE DROWNS IN THE SEA 
LIKE A STONE IS YOUR HEART 
DAY GOES AWAY APPROACH NEW DREAM 
FADED THOUGHTS THROW INTO THE NIGHT 

AS AN OLD TREE I AM 
WHICH IS GROWING AMONG THE SHADOWS 
AS A HARD STONE I AM 
WHICH IS RESTING AMONG THE LANDS 

LIKE A HOME 
DESTROYED BY RAIN AND WIND 
STANDING ALONE 
THROUGH THE ROAD OF LIFE 
HIS OLD ROOTS 
GROWNED TOO DEEP 
I WILL GO AWAY 

MY LIFE DROWNS IN THE SEA 
LIKE A LONLEY FLYING BIRD 
I CAN SEE HIM THROUGH A PAIN 
I CAN SEE HIM THROUGH THE TEARS 
IN THE SEA OF MY SAD DREAMS 
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR A HAPPINESS 
I CAN SEE HER THROUGH THE DARKNESS 
I CAN SEE HER THROUGH REGRET 

LIKE A BIRD, LIKE A RAIN 
THERE ARE MY DREAMS 
I SEE THAT THROUGH THE TEARS 
I SEE THAT THROUGH A PAIN 
LIKE A FLOWER LIKE A WIND 
THERE ARE MY DREAMS 
I SEE THAT THROUGH THE DARKNESS 
I SEE THAT THROUGH THE FOGUgly people are things of the past
Tight firm asses and titties to match
Enjoy the service of a surgeon at last
So come on down we'll have a blast

Kiss your ragged old girls goodbye in the door
Know that she won't be back anymore
What started pretty good soon became a bore
Guess who's coming Friday the chick in the brochure

It's so easy to brainwash yourself, you wanna be...
Something more a little exciting, you try to change yourself
So much uncertainty, wanna be so much somebody else
So now you've got a fucked up mess you don't know who you are
You're so confused, life hurts so bad, it's just not fair, you're oh so sad
Save the self pity and the false solutions
Cause we've all got our problems and you've got to do your best
It can always get better eventually
But you've gotta change your life not who you've gotta be
Acid visions, burning decisions, pressure is building walls of indecision
Use the power, the power your mind, evaluate your life, it's yours and you've
'Bout Had It
You've 'Bout Had It
I've 'Bout Had It
I keep my silence as I wither away
Push the same consistent diaphragm
I am pissed off, this is bullshit
I can't believe that life is really like this
Can you make a true decision?
Leave everyone out, it's your decision
You can change your mind, or leave it be
But if you've 'Bout Had It, try THCAll wishes / all wishes are granted
When all you wish for / when all you wish for is nothing
Don't reason / don't reason with ignorance
There's only brick walls / and towers of emptiness(Eklundh)

I am so healthy, I'm the healthy man
I eat a lot of greens, I do the best I can
Send the germs right up, be a yoghurt-fan 
Healthy

Start the day with yoga
Live in harmony
Then purge the guts real good
And have some oriental tea

Then I stroll into the garden
Where I'm working nude
You see, I grow my own plants
Yeah, I'm a healthy dude 

I am so healthy, I'm the healthy man
I eat a lot of greens, I do the best I can
Send the germs right up, be a yoghurt-fan 

Healthy 

Live by my carrot
I'll save you from decay
Think de-caffeinated
Throw your cigarettes away 

I'm a vegetarian
And you should be one too
And sound mind in sound body
I know what best for you 

I am so healthy, I'm the healthy man
I eat a lot of greens, I do the best I can
Send the germs right up, be a yoghurt-fan 

Yoghurt 

Then one day it happened
The healthy man got sick
He ate all kinds of herbs
But they wouldn't do the trick 

The healthy man got desperate
But no one gave a fuck
He took one step too far
And got run over by a truck

He was so healthy, he was the healthy man
He ate a lot of greens, he was a yoghurt-fan
He was so healthy, he was the healthy man
He ate a lot of beans, but no one gave a damn(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Follow God for a place in Heaven
Spill your blood in the Holy grail,
Crying tears of rape & torture
Frost bound slain, guts for sale.
Die for God in the mill of murder
Walk with God in the afterlife,
Flesh is meat where birds devour
At the gates of paradise.
Fields of flesh from graves ripped open
Only the dead can see an end to war,
Sleeting snow where bones lay broken.
Tell me what all this was for
Tell me what all this was for
Tell me what all this was for
Die for God, Die what
Was it worth dying for?

Cry for God when your life was ending
Call for God now death is near,
Where was God when you were dying
Reek of war is master here.
Left behind are slaughtered strangers
Enemies become your friend
This is how the fear takes over
When its time to meet the end.
Fields of flesh from graves ripped open
Only the dead can see an end to war,
Sleeting snow where bones lay broken.
Tell me what all this was for
Tell me what all this was for
Tell me what all this was for
Die for God, Die what
Was it worth dying for?(Instrumental)Summoning the voices of the eternal suffering
Take my breath and may my pain never die
The urge to die that's tormenting my soul
Tear my flesh oh eternal one

Join my faith to be lost forever
Cry my child cause shadows will hunt you
Drink my misery and mourn eternal
Bittered by reality frozen by fear

Crucify the saints and hear their sickening screams
Hear they suffer in the name of humanity
Centuries of lies has been spoken in vain
Free the mind of their miserable shadows

Nocturnal kingdoms that where built in his name
May we call upon the beings of the almighty Hades
Ancient gods will rise to free the Christian slaves
Their belief will be slained upon the cosmic wall

Shadows of misery will conquer our souls
Be reborn in a world free of humanity
Nothing left to be ruined by our hands
Poisoned by statement that has brought us our free will
We have brought judgement upon ourselves
We must forfill in the shadows of miseryAt your feet, I beg for mercy... to heal my filthy soul. The malaise of perpetual torment burns in my eyes. My grief becomes me. Bereaved and broken for the undying. Ravage me and reveal purpose. Destroy my heart to be raised new. I succumb to powerless adversity. In loneliness, I know passion, To know pain in love, though distant, you are close at heart.. The selfish struggle. Flesh for flesh. Each day, death is my escape... I deny myself for You.Perdition

Fury explodes lighting up the sky
Day of doom
For holy men comes the curse of death 
Rotting for eternity in nameless tombs

Steel glinting in the firelight
Temples burn
The smell of death in the burning air
Echo's, the sound of battle, holy ruin everywhere

A life ruled in chaos,
Given the name of Jesus 
Brought to this light by a false god 
But now he's been dead for years

He should have been our saviour 
But for his life of failure
Gave us his pain and chaos 
Still here he's been dead for ages

False prophet sent down to save us 
We spit on the lamb named Jesus 
Turn on the faiths which bleed us 
And crush to the ground their leaders

Demons, have arrived to take us 
Satan, is the dark descending?
Listen, hear my death awaiting
And for you will come the same

Hate as religion taunts me 
Anger erupts in our eyes 
Blinded quest for holiness 
You made a hell on earth 
Ruled by liesThere's no love here / ruled by hate and fear
You are poisoned / a ghost of what you were
Dead end / city
Wasteland / useless
Worthless flying your flag / another burning
Rag / all faith is just death / it's all just as wasI'm proud to be Creepsylvanian
Pass me some more of that rot-gut
I'm proud to be Creeosylvanian
Hold my seat while I take a piss

The Basilisk sucks dogshit through his nose
His lackies gets brown showers from the Pope
The only reason we live in the catacombs
Is our government makes a living licking shit holes

I'm proud to be Creepsylvanian
Pass me another cabbage roll
I'm proud to be Creepsylvanian
Hold my seat while I go out and vomit

I'm proud to be Creepsylvanian
Pass me another orphan
I'm proud to be Creepsylvanian
Hold my seat while I fuck him up the asshole(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Enslavement till the grave
The survival is mean aim
Don't speak and hold your breathe
Welcome to our steel hell 
The pulse of noisy factories Machines
and the slaves in dungarees

Breaking their hack to earn a dime
Every day on the assembly line
Stinky sweat and dirty faces 
The enslavement in common places
It's better for them don't think
Their lungs are dusty from the stink
Enslavement till the grave
The survival is mean aim
Don't speak and hold your breathe
You're welcome to steel hell

Piece to piece for some suckers
I'm so pissed from these fuckers
Working men sweat their blood
They are really not so glad
Head drudgery for the pigs
They think for their own profits
Abhorrence of the stinking rich

People are for them just shit
Can you hear the scorn of gods?
Modest life fine for us
Enslavement till the grave
The survival is mean aim
Don't speak and hold your breathe
You're welcome to steel hell

Blindness deafness Permanent disability
Hardly work and keep your mood
Hungary stay and save your food
Losers need money for bread
And the boss a new chevrolet(Instrumental)(Instrumental)She believed everybody had this drive, but that they justify it into things like "religion, politics, family, work" and that she just wanted to experience that drive without those veils around it.
She not only did not want to let go of this drive to "live a better life" she was believing that that drive was the only real value in life.
The flame that burned within every human being, but the very flame that they tried to extinguish.
The flame of no joy, no friendship, no companionship, no safety, the flame of void. The flame that sometimes takes over the person which humans disgustingly call "depression". The only real flame, calling one away from the prison.
The flame of chaos.
Her mother was presently absent with her constant harassment and fear and her father was ever present with his calculated absence.
She grew herself up into a malfunction of an antithesis to this existence, it was beautiful seeing her move around the room devouring every sort of life.(spoken word passage)
the boy sitting upon the stair
wishing he wasnt there
screaming in his head
no more can he bare

forced to consume this affinity of despair
to unlock the secrets within a tarnished mind
is to own a burden you cannot free yourself from

there is no escape from the hell we create for ourselves(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The earth last breath
07/2000

The moon had left the white drape,
the sun no longer shine
the whole cosmos is waiting for the final funeral
A silent anthem is slowly performed
A cold orchestration of decline

This is the earth last breath

I've longly awaited
for the fall of this weak empire
All human's pride reduced to ashes
Blowed away by the wind of destiny
Scattered by unknown maleficiant forces

Finaly, I succed in my deathspell
and upon humanity i launched
a thousand neutron bombsA taste of decadence
So lovely and cold
To the bitter end
A crack in the mould

In the aftermath
The fallout so pure
carved in our bones
Taught to endure

I can't seem to escape this insanity
The pictures all seem wrong
But take them one by one
In the light of the fading sun

It is my blood on the canvas
In the tarot on the altar
A well-known scene:
The visionaire extreme

In the aftermath
The fallout so pure
carved in our bones
Taught to endureThe Trial awaits 
It's made by those who are dead 
And they don't regret 

The jury at hand 
Corpses that now lost in time 
Decide on your fate 

The audience observes 
With narcissistic smiles but 
They don't smile at you 

The Trial awaits 
It's made by those who are dead 
And they don't forgetWhat we take from grace, 
destroys our thoughtful days. 
Grasping with trembling digits at which we were once rueful. 

Times before we were swept away, 
and fumbled the brilliant shafts of light, 
had traded them for a tamer darkness, 
and shinier things, 
and lost sight of those playful children, 
and felt our blood running cold, 
sterile, 
bitter, 
and whipped our skin to punish sin. 

Witnessed your machine; so beautiful, 
withered in plastic, 
now broken. 
A man may stand or a man may die. 
May die. 
Go back to the womb.When I sleep there is no peace
Troubled thoughts lead to troubled dreams
Restless spirits they live inside me
I can only hope for peace...

Wait for tomorrow and hope for the best
Darkest nights my one regret
Pray for redemption
To save my soul
What lives inside me, you'll never ever know
Never know...

I take for granted a new day will dawn
Wait for tomorrow
I must carry on!

A dark shadow appears in my head
Not of the living, must be undead!
Embraces me with evil intent
Restless spirits, they will not relent!

Tortured dreams, are not what they seem
Scared to death...unable to scream
Gripped with fear, I try to awaken
What it wants there's no mistaken
Into darkness from fading light
My daylights now eternal night
Pray for redemption to save my soul
What lives inside me you'll never ever know!

A dark shadow appears in my head
Not of the living, must be undead!
Embraces me with evil intent
Restless spirits, they will not relent!(Instrumental)Why weren't you here
when i stood alone
you won't believe
all that i've learned
and all that i have known

She pulls me through
all of her bodies
calling out
magnetically

Her depths hide nothing from me

I befriended deepest fathoms
and returned stronger still
starving for your praise at the crest of every swell
I find dissuasion of tides
i find dissuasion of tides

She uses no words to reveal her deep
your shallows blur all that you speak
to the equal before me
I find dissuasion of tides
i find dissuasion of tides(Instrumental)i've become the nuclear image of eternity i'm the original stuff. all the
universes find their pattern in my being. for i'm the cosmic infinitesmal.
i'm the source. i'm the fountain. exploding in your face. (with a flick of
my wrist a new cosmos begins.) how glorious to be alive. be here with me now
in timeless micro-infinity.

reality now an oceanic flow of particles in everchanging patterns. panta
rei. undulating within the ultimate core of self. which is no-self. inside
this boundless thought wave. all is one and one is god. (truth is one. sui
generis)

everything is coming in waves and from all sides. nuclear. molecular and
cellular layers. modular wave-hierarchies. epi-phenomenon of the
ground-of-being of all other grounds-of-being. in a fractual involution. the
reversal of evolution. becoming is absolute. time is dying a slow death. the
eschaton is near. i'm into an ideational singularity: propelling towards the
neuro-galatic center, the transcendental nexus of self and world. a cosmic
junction where on a physical level: matter and anti-matter merge into each
other. into emptiness and on a psychic level god and self are inextricably
intertwined.Seducer Darkness Covers me with Its Cold,
Hugging me and Filling with Death my Empty Body,
Their Black Face as Night Wrapped in a Sharp Laugh,
Harvest Their Seed of Sadness in my Grassland Already Withered.

Each Memory Arrives to me, Taken of this White Hands
Travelling One by One Laments of my Life.
My Skin Already Taking their Colour and my Eyes,
As Circle of Water
Only to Receive the Beauty of their Body Nude.

She Unites to me, Every Time that my Fullness Leaves
And Gardens Sigh While They are in Death Agony in the Dimness,
And She goes Hawai to Give me Youth and a Smile,
Next to the Seed Transformed into Flower.

The Night is for me the Day, and its Light illuminates my Path.
Eternal Dreams of Humid Fragance and a Endless Stars.
Their Tears Disappear Before the Night Every Time Shorts Yet,
Taking me to Rest and to Wait Their Arrival Again.Nature will step on you,
nature will eat you up,

Nature don't care for you,
nature don't see you.

You've Lost

If I could see without your sight,
I would not be alive. If I could see without your sight
I would be alive If I was alive
If I was alive
If I could be
If I could beFollow me you unworthy sinners, pave my path and
together we will darken the sky, we will rage forward
through the pearly gates of heaven singing the choirs of
the damned.

I'm a raging storm, I'm the lust that keeps you awake
I'm the cloud that darkens your heart,
I'm the unworthy messiah.

With gathered hordes of fearless men,
strong and free from the damnation of the crucifix,
with conviction stronger than steal
and a vision of victory under the sky..

It's the solitary concept that all beings intend to 
Obtain and grasp 
Humans pair off and intertwine into an inevitable throbbing end 
An end so overwhelming it transfigures the ordinary into being unstable 
The unsteady rapidly wither into a State of Desolation 
Hopelessness so extensive it creates a cavity onto the chest 
A gaping hole displaying the increasing panic within(Instrumental)A fire burns, the flames lick at me. And patience sparks life. So I will wait and adore you from this distance. A fire burns. Water laps at my soul, frigid and cold, begging to free me... to cease this breathing... and consume those who it has never known. They cycle and become it. To praise death... thankful, it is, to liberate the faithful. To praise life... so vain and selfish. Shall I clam death as my savior? My key to God? Shall I fear it as fate? As a means to an end?I awaken from what can hardly be called sleep
Starving as if I had two stomachs to feed
An ebb and tide of images in my mind of the two of you keeps my gut painfully empty
The tar boils and churns
I carve out and deny these infections on my soul and watch as they spawn a life of their own
Leaving snail trails of scars over what little of me is still pure
As they crawl towards where the tar boils and churns
Aborted parts of my psyche are all found nourishing themselves at these pits
Bubbling forth from the recesses of my mind where all I am slowly falls in
Abominations of my being incessantly teethinginside, dark and desolate
cold and uninviting
the decline of brightness
feel the cold touch of nothingness

nero, the darkness, consumes me

the beat of my heart slows
shall my very being escape itself?
this is a horrific existance raped upon us all

not apart of this world
ostricised from all
dark and desolate is this place inside

nero, the darkness, consumes me
feel the cold touch of nothingnes
nero, the darkness, consumes me

the emptiness and solitude
you must embrace or perish
into the blind mocking of insanity

LIBERATE ME EX INFERISYou are deemed to be in prolonged agony
Till I reached the apex of cruelty
On the verge of death, in a bloody mess
The fork takes you of your breath
Salvation was saught, you were always taught
To respect the highest court
Case of minor offence, according to documents
A prelude to death sentence
Sharp prongs penetrate deeply the flesh
Above the sternum and below the chin, the fork impales your gash
The fork prevented any movement
And forced the victim to murmur the words of repentance
This is your last supper and your death sentence
You will be dressed in a traditional costume
Led to the stake, I hope you can smell the fumes
Small investment of time and effort 
In proportion to the amount of pain
Saves time and money, it works 24 hours a day
Nor does the executioner have to be paid
Sharp spikes pierced your body
Nails were arranged cleverly
They will not penetrate any vital organs
You are destined to suffer a long agonyPainful seconds five
For some moments hope remains, keeps me alive
My lungs are out of air
What should I be, blindly searching my way 

I quiver and cry and I scream for a future immersed in today
I'm stoned by commandments and morals and rules, an addict forced to approve

I build me a great cage out of lies wrapped up in silk and in cellophane
The truths we held dear changed too many times, leaving us no ground to stand onKwi kwi, biszkopciki

when every feeling has been crushed by your world,
and you know, I'll find,
my purity inside is all that's mine. 

You make me feel what you feel,
I will become you 'cause you know what's real,
and I'll see what you see,
you'll never be me 'cause I've found my soul. 

[repeat 1st verse]I want to die my Angel now, this is not for me
And people here are like devil's sons, world of sin

I want to my mother, mother

I want to go back to the mother womb, I want to hide

I want to my mother, mother
I want to my..I laugh at you bible whores
Slave bastards you are
Living a lie under god

I laugh at your Jesus Christ
Open your eyes
He looks so pathetic weak nailed to his cross

Like zombies you enter the church
One after one in a line
To recieve what the priest has in mind
Feeding a story of lies

I laugh at your holy priest
With your church you will die
Fire will devour your home

I will laugh when I see you dead
Flames melting your skin
Smell of victory

Like zombies you enter the church
One after one in a line
To recieve what the priest has in mind
Feeding a story of lies

Priest howling in church about something they think they know so much about bible whores
Satisfied people they exit the church living a lie under god
God and his bible will mess up your head like a priest you will suck Jesus cock
Live under Satan and live as you want or forever live as bible whores

I laugh as I see you pray
How silly you look
The candles you light I blow out

I laugh when I hear you sing
Those songs for your god
No one will ever save you

God's bible whores. I laugh at them all. five dollar whores
Too blind to see. Reality.(Instrumental)Austrian nights, so cold and dank
Snow covered graves and frozen lakes
The voices of children and women croon
Bits of burned bone shaped like crescent moons

We bought glue to put our pieces together
It had no fumes -- it was a thick white paste
Instead we went to a local tavern
Where the Austrian spirits had a strange taste

Butterscotch drops and turpentine
We ate the paste but did not get high
Drunk on Stroh we stumbled sickly
One by one we vomit seperately

Our private prison to our house of spirits
No AA for me -- just glue and doom
This sort of life, no medals merit
Just to drink Stroh "80" in Austria soonThe human body begins to fragment its framework splits  into multiple pieces creating a pool of conceptual flesh the mind swells with dismal meditation  causing the body to dilute and ache a thirst an itch a hunger for existance dby's up and slowly begins to relinquish in the human mind desire magnifies with an unsteady tread only causing apprehension the roots of sanity are pulled from the feet we can never reach the external world reality the world of perception is within our minds(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Provisioning drain 
Circuitry of extraction 
Trapped in cancer 
Obsessed illusion 

Rapacity of carnage exceeds tolerance 
Thoughtless abuse practiced rape 
Supervised extraction suits voracious interests 
That sap the blood from the Earth's heart 

The spine of a prolonged delusion 
We are controlled by unseen terrorIs this life
Or just death disguised living reality
All in vain
Perception staring into an illusion
Through the eyes of the dead
We suffocate
Just to breathe
In this place we're all the same
Ill-fated and broken
Who are you to take our precious dreams away
Who are you to know that you took anything at all
Because the rain won't fall
If there's nothing to recall
For acclimation springs
Forth a new beginning's end...
If only this curse
Took something from substance
And made it a blessing
But how would we know
The difference without adversity
Fate henceforth bestowed
Sensation controls
And emanates through all
Thus stagnation falls
Heeding to the call
Of selflessness preceding
Conscious acts of being
Sleep walking anomaly
With closed eyes staring from the womb
A pitch black view of reality
Buried by remnants of that which has been forgotten 
The birth of tragedy
Only to begin yet againBEHOLD THE SUN THE EVERLASTING POWER
BLINDING THE EYES TO THE CORE OF HUMAN SELF
THE MOON TURNS UP IN THE FINAL HOUR
THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE EVIL DREAMS
I AM FEELING THE HEAT WITHIN MY SOUL
THE SENSE OF FAMILIAR SENSATION AND THRILL
THE MORE YOU'RE COMING BACK THE MORE I LET YOU GO
THIS IS UNSTOPPABLE URGE TO KILL

IT'S SO EASY TO SPILL THE BROTHER'S BLOOD

My love for you is oh, so true

My brick of cheese
What would I ever do without you
My brick of cheese

Yeah, I love you
My brick of cheeseWith sinful troops of Belzebub
I lust in flesh and truth
With hateful witchery of belieal
I curse my enemy self righteous
With ministers of evil medidim
I bring disaster and pain
Under the command of abaddon
I cause mayhem and war
With steel I cursh the holy plan
The king of snakes must bleed
I claim the throne by might
Praise the satanic victoryWho saved your ass from Adolf

made him blow his brains out?

Who put their lives on the line

for you winesipping faggots?

Who has the strength and guts

to run against the grain

the largest budget deficit

and still the biggest balls?

Our corn chambers feed you

on our machines you depend

only spite and contempt in return

then you beg for our guns

A day of reckoning will come

with terrorist knives in your back

we won't let our boys be killed

again without guarantees

No more shall we bleed

to fulfill your one-way need

not our goddamn job to feed

the egoes of European cowards

Your spokesmen so dear

talk about spreading fear

but fear breeds fear

and draws the enemy near

The others demand blood

ours but yours too

you have a choice as well

everybody has a choice

What do you choose

seems to you've made

your mind up and already

your trousers' on your ankles

Your ass is in the open

ready to get fucked

you say your hands are tied

you can nothing do but talk

So this is freedom for you

every man has a godgiven right

to get violently sodomized

and rubbed into the dirt

Then we once again

throw your tea into the sea

let your sorry soldiers

stay at home this time

We have the weapons

and the will to use them

our principles stand

we'll die defending them

No more shall we bleed

to fulfill your one-way need

not our goddamn job to feed

the egoes of European cowardsEvery word you forced from my lips
Every vileness you made me say
Makes me sick from inside out
I am caught in a web of betrayal
This cannot last forever
It's my own, not yours to take
This cannot endure forever
It's my life, not yours to reign

I send myself across horizons
This is what I longed for
This is the end of resilience
Awakened by revenge

You will be judged
You will be silenced
By a crescendo
Of dreadful deeds

I realize this is the day, the end of the line
Your lies are taking form
Deadly fangs with a beautiful face
You will be judged ... soon it will be over
You will be cleansed ... will it ever stop?
This is the end, the end of resilience
Soon it will be over
You will be cleansed
You shall be perished
You will fade
There's no god to raise the tide
There's no demon to finish the fight
What is left, is an empty case
We are caught in a maze of disgrace
This cannot last forever
It's my own, not yours to take
This cannot last forever
It's my life, not yours to reignSACRIFICE FOR THE APOCALYPTIC VISION

X. ABOMINOX
 
Stygian forces rupture the seals
Sewage and swamp gas and garbage congeals
The odious vortex begins to reveal
A psychotic nightmare for eons concealed
Twenty eyes begin to open and close
A river of refuse from an orifice flows
As a towering tangle of effluvium rose
The madness grows

Lunches lost as the creature forms
Slick with shit and discarded porn
Mummified corpses entwine and adorn
From multiple mandibles a testament sworn
 
Abominox...
King of the Mouldy Ones
I rise!
 
Up from the bog he comes to conquer humanoids
Dripping with fungal ooze from toxic hemorrhoids
Rupturing roots encroach, collapsing mammoth blocks
Humans are doomed to die... unleash Abominox
 
Flesh from bone is flayed
Skulls are crushed with rocks
Feeble minds enslaved
To serve AbominoxWe are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Cuddled up to eah other
The pighead full of straw(s)

The whispers we exchange
Are devoid of meaning
Army must have moral men
Able to use their instinctive pulsions to kill

Without any emotion(s)
Without any passion
Without any judgement
I commit hundred(s) (of) horrors

Horrors you've seen
But you refuse to see
Cause they get too much
For the ordinary men

Words are powerless to describe
Clearly what is necessary
For those who don't know
What the real horror means

You've (got) no right to call me (an) assassin
But you've (got) the right to kill me
You've (got) the right to do it
But you've (got) no right to judge meShut me down 
I won't mind 
done and through 
seeking your sunshine 
I am done

I am done

When I feel like I've been

Taken by your words

Stretched beyond

Cannot fix the loose ends of mine

Now do I? 
Why do I? 
Now do I? 
Enough fucking lies!

Burn me with your sunThe past is dead
A corpse cannibalized by the present
To be regurgitated in fear and greed
In endless justification and apologetics
Human agency and its offshoots
The years grind jumbled and broken
Regret, nostalgia, grief-at-nothing
Grief and sleep, combined, enchaining
Care itself, in its very essence,
Is permeated with nullity through and throughI'm the psylocybe ministry
Abolish all laws
What is hypocrisy?
I'm the bad thoughts in you head
I'm the darkness that is real
This is real
The busy girl
She strokes midnightTaste the flames that murder

You can't prepare for torture

As the blood flows out

Look to my eyes and feel my hate

 

Taste of blood

To cure the fix

 

All the life draining from you

Now's the time to repent

But you see I am your god today

Mercy is not my name

 

I am your savior in deathI wake up in a wey dungeon
Where am I? what am I doing here?
I've lost my memories
maybe, slowly, they'll come back..
Oh She was so beautiful yesterday night
If Heaven does really exist
It would be like her face (Her body)
I remember only Her Kisses
her tenderness
Her lips, blood red lips
whisper me sweet (hypnotic words)
The Obscure kiss
She betrayed me with her behaviour
( so lascivious an' erotic)
She turned me into a damned
She betrayed me with a kiss
Like the Iscariot did
I am a son of darkness
I am a creature of Hell
I will hide myself from the warm sun
And cry my agony to the pale Moonlight
I will live for eternity
Sharing my days with this woman
BLOODSUCKERS
They call it Hell
and if this the real Hell
Oh, I want to be a part of it FOREVER....Every night in my dreams
 I see you, I feel you
 That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
 And spaces between us
 You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
 I believe that the heart does go on
 Once more you open the door
 And you're here in my heart
 And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
 And last for a lifetime
 And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
 One true time I hold to
 In my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
 I believe that the heart does go on
 Once more you open the door
 And you're here in my heart
 And my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear
 And I know that my heart will go on
 We'll stay forever this way
 You are safe in my heart
 And my heart will go on and onfelt deep the mad world

across the sickroom of deliveryAfter 9/11 the American people were scared straight. Sending their sons to war and proudly waving their fucking flags, when the patriot act was passed in secrecy.
Using clever rhetoric they got the majority to go along.
What you don't know about the patriot act is it completely takes away your rights.
A terrible time is coming!
And the act will render you completely helpless!Your life is just a repetition, it exposes your denial
You need this routine every day to stop you thinking
Why do your allow yourself to feed from the off the floor like dogs
Here is your last wake up call like no other
Tick tock tick tock
The noise is rising

Eruption boils beneath the streets as bassline quakes the roads
The notes that slide between the cracks are forst to greet the toes
Eruption boils beneath the streets as bassline quakes the roads
Take us back to how we were before we felt so cold

As you feel the disambiguation
Feelings in the bowel begin to strand and rumble
You drop to your knees and gasp at the sky
As your bowels empty you wonder why

People in the streets are covered in their own faeces

Breath deeplyWhy does daddy hammer mommy? 
Weak body screams again and again
Filthy wilted flesh, bruises ugly
Sick worn bones and a blue-swollen skin

Play dead - Death bed
Play dead - Raped dead

Tried so hard to make him stop
But what can I do, he's my dad 
I'm only five years old
Maybe mommy was just being bad?

Play dead - Death bed
Play dead - Raped deadFeel the voice you just can hear
the slow chase of a hungry soul
eternal runaway in dreadful gravity

Wet flash light
dons the silent scream
wet flash light 
lonesome soul disease 
wet flash light

Bleed the velvet sweet

Awe the winged stain
come you lustful sea, the ocean, stream
devoured in thirst I'm left to stay
right away

I can't satand long this game
a warhound in a battlefield
blind to feel

Rule the bleakest shade
a crimson crown so pale
rule the bleakest shade
avoid the beams that tame
rule the the bleakest shade
a crimson crown so pale

Feel the voice you just can hear in dreams
the slow chase of a hungry soul, serene
eternal runaway in dreadful gravityEnter, House of horror 
Murder, death and torture 
Mansion of death, family secret 
Morbid incest, insane bloodlust 
Axe swings, limbs are chopped off 
Fresh blood, spraying the walls 
Hacked to pieces, gruesome slaughter 
Blood-soaked, fill the hallwaysYOU LOOK AT WORLD FROM LITTLE DISTANCE
GREETING SO INFLEXIBLE EVERY DAY
YEARS OF GLORY ARE LEAVING TO OBLIVION
TODAY'S TIME IS UNDER OTHER IDEA

AND PEOPLE ARE PASSING INDIFFERENTLY
RARELY DIRECTING EYES TO YOU
INTO PANIC RUTH AND INDIFFERENCE
ACCIDENTALLY ASSOCIATING YOUR GREAT FIGURE

YOU WOULD WANT TO GIVE IN THAT HELPLESSNESS
CUNNING ARTIST HAS CLOSED TOY INTO STONE
MEMORY OF PAST IS YOUR ONLY VOICE 
HOW TO BRING BACK GREATNESS OF DISTANT YEARS

STREAM OF RAIN IS SCULPTING NEW GOWNS
MOUTH LOST SERIOUS PULLING BY WIND
WILD ROSE IS CUTTING WITH SHARP THORN
IT'S DISHONOR OR TRIUMPH OF LAST WITNESSShatter and blacken the Earth
We are nothing, pour us into the sea
This place is the province of fools
Screaming once, then gone

We are born into the ground
Three fingers down
Kindness, cut out our babbling tongues
Running frantic, dripping blood

Let us go, you are unkind
Forgive us, and we'll die afraid
Far from the light of day
With our arms open wide:

Your cold, dead children
We cry for you
Under the flood, choking on ash
We cry for you

Reject the sun
Kill our tomorrow
Bury our heads
Are we not wise?

Breathe in the dirty, you failing child
And we'll die afraid
Writhing in this heaven you made
Under a cold, black sky

Let us go, you are unkind
Forgive us(Instrumental)Oh, Yeah
Yeah yeah, Huh
Uh, yeah
In the the midnight hour, with my super powers
I wanna burn it all with fire, Fire!
And for all the sadness and my glimpse of madness
I have decided to get rid of all the darkness
For all the smiles
I have been losing along my road
(Long my road)
I cross my heart and make a wish
and laugh 'till i have breath in my lungs
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright! Yeah!
Yeah yeah huuhhuh
Ah!
Ooh, With the negativity, you've been spitting over me
I have been building my own castle, Castle!
No illusions, no secret doors
I dont know what i was waiting for
I will lock myself up leaving you to your disaster
For all the smiles
I have been losing along my road
(Along my road)
I cross my heart and make a wish
and laugh 'till i have breath in my lungs
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright!
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright
I cant stop messin' with the fire inside
I will smile smile smile, but if needed i'll still kick you
Down down down where you usually hide
I still got my attitude, I'll never let you cut through
For all the smile, Ohh woah ohhh
Woah woahh ohhh ahh, I
I wanna smile... wanna smile...!
Woahhh!
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright!
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright!
Yeahh!
Ah, Enjoy the ride!! Yeah!Alone in the darkness,alone in the pain
Nothing seems real,only thoughts of insane
A world that is fear,despairing so good
Bring forth the change I wish that I could

You aren't me
You can't feel the pain that I feel
I can't be
Something whole something real

Suffering silence,a prison so cold
The notion of change,is becoming so old
The hurt runs too deeply,a vile putrid thing
Overcome with this darkness,the mind always winsSchmotz, schmotz, let me schmotz you
I wanna schmotz you in the face 'cause it's cool
Come on
I wanna schmotz you
Come on
Schmotz

Schmotz, schmotz, let me schmotz you
I wanna schmotz you in the face 'cause it's cool
Come on
I wanna schmotz you
Come on
Schmotz

(Wicked solo)

Schmotz, schmotz, let me schmotz you
I wanna schmotz you in the face 'cause it's cool
Come on

I wanna schmotz you in the face 'cause it's cool

Schmotz, schmotz, let me schmotz you
I wanna schmotz you in the face 'cause it's cool
Come on
I wanna schmotz you
Come on
Schmotz(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Like a deserted beach,
The man closing up.

Broken glass on the rocks,
And seaweed coming in
To hang up on the rocks.

Walk with care,
It's slippery here.

Old pilings, rotted, broken like teeth
Where a pier was.

A mouth,
And the tide coming in.

The man closing up
Is like this.Toxic humanity 
The poison of our nature 
We are pollution 
An illness of the world 
Piles of litter, a waste of a civilization 
Spreading bacteria 
A sickness of planet earth 

A germ, a disease, a virus, an infection 
A germ, a disease, a virus, an infection 
A germ, a disease, a virus, an infection 
That's what we are! 

The point of no return. All our fault, when will we learn 
The point of no return. All the wreckage, death pattern 
The point of no return. All in ruins, let it burn 
The point of no return 

The natural's vomit 
The garbage of D.N.A 
The stench of feces 
we are a reeking rubbish 
The trash of the globe 
Choking the air out of our atmosphere. 
We are left over junk 
Nothing but a disgrace 

A germ, a disease, a virus, an infection 
A germ, a disease, a virus, an infection 
A germ, a disease, a virus, an infection 
That's what we are! 

The point of no return. All our fault, when will we learn 
The point of no return. All the wreckage, death pattern 
The point of no return. All in ruins, let it burn 
The point of no return 

Watch the rippling waves 
We are all torn asunder! 
Cant see past the rippling waves 

Making the world sick with venom 
What a way to kill planet earth 
Waking up to a disaster 
Destroy, destruction , conclusion 

The point of no return. All our fault, when will we learn 
The point of no return. All the wreckage, death pattern 
The point of no return. All in ruins, let it burn 
The point of no returnI LOOK IN DIAMOND STONE
I READ CALENDAR OF PAST DAYS
I COUNT DEFEATS AND VICTORIES
I'M WALKING FAMOUS WAY AGAIN

WHAT TO RECORD COMMON LIFE
HOW CRITICALLY TO ASSESS PLAYED
NOW OTHER EMOTIONS REMIND ME
THIS WHAT IS CLOSED UNDER THAT DATE

I ADMIRE MOMENTS OF PRIDE
I COULD HIT IN DESTINY'S FACE
AND TO HOLD OUT AS UNBENDING
I PERCEIVE TRAGEDIES TOO

I EASY FALL ON HARD GROUND
I'M SEPARATING THOSE DAYS WITH SHAME
IT'S ONLY WHAT IS MINE ...IRREFUTABLE WORK
OUTPUT OF TIME WHICH FATE HAS THROWN TO ME
HONOR AND PRIDE CONFIRMED WITH ACT
AND UNDERSIGNED WITH INITIAL OF MY EXISTENCEFEAR CLOUSED IN EXPRESSION OF FACE 
WHEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHIRLING THOUGHTS 
BELL OF LONELINESS CALLS WIND 
BLOWING FAR AWAY 
AND HIS SCREAM HERALDS MIGHT OF DEATH 
I DELIGHT FLOWS OUT THE INTRICATE 
ROADS OF FLESH 
EXPLODES BY LIGHT FOR SENSES 
LUSTING AFTER BLOOD 
SO GREAT IS HIS WORLD OF RATTLED WORDS 
AND WIND UNDERSTOOD 
WHAT HE ALWAYS KNEW 

FOR LONLEY WINDS THE HOPE IS COMING 
FOR LONLEY WINDS WINTER LEFT FOREVER 

WHEN YOU SEE THE FLOWER GROWING 
AMONG THE TEARS 
HAPPINESS OF HIS BREEZE MAKES YOU FEEL FREE 
SO SHEMING FATE OVERFILLED WITH MISERY 
CRUSHING ALL HOPE FOR CALM GROWTH 
WAITING FOR THE NIGHT TO DISCOVER UNKNOWN LANDS 
UNDERSTANDING HE WANTS TO BE ALONE TO INCARNATE 

FOR LONLEY WINDS WORDS ARE WHISPERING 
FOR LONLEY WINDS THE PEACE CAME(Eklundh)

You can not see your misery
But you are climbing on the misery-tree
You broadcast filth, you bring us pain
We sow a tumor in your brain
Turn on your TV, what do you see?
You're trapped inside our philosophy
Hallucinations becoming real
A fair price for the shit you deal

I don't know you...

I'm not your private toy-maniac
Well, well, well, I'll be paying you back
Don't know exactly just what to do
Maybe I'll die, but first I'm killing you

I don't know you
I don't want to
I'll see you in Pittsburgh
Long live the New Flesh

I can not see my misery
I guess I'm climbing up that misery-tree
But it's my life, it's my Swiss army-knife
Do as I want, I'll cut my self free 

I don't know you
I don't want to
I'll see you in Pittsburgh
Long live the New FleshIn the darkened mind, I see a light
Black desert oasis
This need to feed shall see my fall
I thirst for purity
With bones and mud, we built a dark house 
And in here I'll hide 
From the thing I've left behind 
And the way I feel inside
With bones and mud, we built a dark house 
This is where we'll survive
No... you finally see through the pride
No longer believing in lies
Never a need to disguise
The different darkness in your eyes
Even the darkness cannot 
Hide from the things I've left behind 
When demons manifest inside
A different darkness in your eyes
Now I finally see through the pride

No longer believe in your lies
I cannot wear the disguise 
That hides the different darkness

Welcome back to the things 
You thought you left behind youMy mind''s seizing a mental void
A while to carry myself to the imaginary self world
To escape from the sorrow-full reality
Of yesterdays feelings, another defeat. Materialistic tendencies
False faces. Vacant eyes
It''s like-a safety value delivering me
From the dirty obsessive thoughts
A while to become a human scum again(Instrumental)Me fui a la chucha, justo al final...I dreamed that one had died in a strange place
Near no accustomed hand,
And they had nailed the boards above her face,
The peasants of that land,
Wondering to lay her in that solitude,
And raised above her mound
A cross they had made out of two bits of wood,
And planted cypress round;
And left her to the indifferent stars above
Until I carved these words:
She was more beautiful than thy first love
But now lies under boards.(Instrumental)There is a word for it,
A simple word,
And the word goes around.

It curves like a staircase,
And it goes up a staircase,
And it is a staircase.

An iron staircase
On the side of a lighthouse
All in his head.

And it makes no sound at all
Inside his head,
Unless he says it.

Then the keeper
Steps on the rung,
The bottom rung,

And the ascent begins,
Clangorous,
Rung after rung.

He wants to keep the light going,
If he can.

But the man closing up
Does not say the word.The entropic will of cosmos turns us into dust as the crushing murk expands within realms. (The vision of) fractal emptiness is drowned in the infinity of voices and the dimensional fissure incurves beyond another horizon.

Strangled by light in the sea of madness. Torn from the womb of the other sun. A pulsating flash comes from the seething void and the atrophied world begins to measure its time.

Life itself suffocates in this sea of worms. The horizon turns and becomes everything. I taste metal in a place where the mouth used to be as the prayer for light ordains the fall.

Anointed in the ash of the planet Earth, in the endless uproar of infinity of voices, a man creates a spine of the perverse god. The anthropic principle denotes a time wasted. Nuclei of dead stars vibrate, yet only the greatest shall offer a glimpse through the discord within symmetry, the act of malicious will that binds the cosmos, forevermore.Here is my anger
The beast within let loose
A tale of injustice
And revenge to be taken
Here is my anguish
The torment of rejection
Shivering nights
Loneliness and hatred

Fear has taken me
Ripped my back with hooks
There is one way to heal
To grow a skin of stone
Statues feel no pain
The misery of being
So have I been carved
By Destiny my master

Monolith - rise
When you fall I shall stand
Monolith - ascend
When you fail I stay strong

All this emotion
Caged in a corner
I let the fire rage
Ravaging its target
When help isn't there
You have to save yourself
Here is my desperation
The prey within let loose

Monolith - rise
When you fall I shall stand
Monolith - ascend
When you fail I stay strong

A sceptre of the Earth
A monument of will
I wish I could let go
Of the feelings that kill me
As a hermit I evolved
The alchemy of mind
Granite and not gold
That was what I got

Here is my anger
The beast within let loose
A tale of injustice
And revenge to be taken
Here is my anguish
The torment of rejection
Of nights shivering
Loneliness and hatredPlease allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long long year stolen many man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ had His moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed His fate
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game 

Stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tzar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank held a gen'rals rank when the blitzkrieg
raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name. Oh yeah
Ah what's puzzling you is the nature of my game. Oh yeah 

I watched the glee while your kings and queens fought for
ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedy's?" when after all
it was you and me
Let me please intruduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadors who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name. Oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game. Oh yeah
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game 

Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners, Saints
as heads is tails, just call me Lucifer 'cause I'm in need
of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy have some sympathy
and some taste
Use all your well learned politesse or I'll lay your soul to waste
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my gameI sucked on the teat
I bathed in the four rivers
I watched the world flood
I beheld
the Udder of Death

I tasted the flesh
I swam in the blood
I watched the forests burn
I quenched my thirst
with the Udder of DeathBehold the sky
Your eyes seen by my eyes

Predominance (X2)
You're my covenant (X2)
Predominance (X2)
You're my covenant (X2)

Unlimited Room for thought
Wedding ring, pull it off

Repeat Chorus

Make it Right(Silence, silence)
A neverending instant
At the edge of the abyss
Looking stunned looking stunned
The void below us the void below us
Feeling every single heartbeat
Growing faster
Growing faster and faster

Don't think about it
Concentrate on her
My face - Her face - My heart - Her heart, my love

I don't care
If it's my last breath
(You didn't care when I was here alone)
I had your love for just one day
(You will never have my love anymore)
No regrets, I tasted your lips

For my last time before, just before, before
(Our last night on earth)
(Have you ever dreamed to fall in the darkness?)

That feel of stress, emptiness and fear
The world is almost over
The core has been corrupted
Consumed by the greed
Everything is gonna exploding
Is gonna exploding harder

Don't think about it
Concentrate on her
My face - Her face - My heart - Her heart, my love

I don't care
If it's my last breath
(You didn't care when I was here alone)
I had your love for just one dayDisturbed by the glamour
Of death, gloomy thoughts,
Thoughts of death. cold
Fingers caress my spine, the
Time will come. i will die
The time will come. i will
Die. i feel the coldness of
My flesh. i will raise from
The grave. i feel the
Coldness of my flesh. i will
Raise from the grave
Suffering, but without
Resistance. i'll reach the
End of existence. dead....
Dead. i want to be a dead
Never will i forget, your
Smoothness, mould, as i
Dipped in you. before being
Lifeless....(Instrumental)Pride is my slogan
honor is my strength
truth is my mower
justice is my name

MISERY I must kill
BLOOD I must stop to spill
WORLD I must clean
DEATH I have got to win
FEAR I must destroy
MAN is my only toy
SUN is my shelter
TIME is my holy helper

CHORUS:
Neverending struggle
fighting for surviving
there will be a winner
and will have die the sinner

Cowardige is my slogan
shame is my strength
falsify is my mower
anfairness is my name

MISERY I must kill
BLOOD I must stop to spill

JOY I must destroy
DEATH is my only toy
NIGHT is my shelter
DEVIL is my holy helper

(CHORUS)

Higher kind of people
lower will have to die
smashing skull of devil
holyness must go on

(CHORUS)Low life scum, useless bum
But I get laid anyways
Stalking down women day and night
I beat and fuck them while they put up a fight

Gut yourself, fuck youself, end your life for your god

Masturbating as she fucks herself
Sodomzing and debauchery
Shove a 12 inch blade right into your cunt
Rip you open a new fucking asshole
Bleeding from your crotch you have no hope
Worthless fucking bitch you'll die a whore

Take my time, eye my bride 
Find my rope, tie her right
Searching through the darkness, looking for a whore
Searching for that victim to send to the morgue
Lick her tits, feel her twat
Stick my dick in her butt
Fornication with a 12 year old, no pubic hair on her tight little hole
Cuff a screaming slut to a rotting carcass
Fist fuck them both as I cum in my pants
Piss on her face and then in her ass

I'm a sick son of a bitch - as it drives my malicious intentBorn on a night, in distant times
Three mages there, truly divine
First came the father, the mother and the son
Son of God, the chosen one

Can you believe I am God, not a man
Can you see, do you understand

I am the one that you seek
I am the one to believe
I turn the water into wine
I am everything
I am the one that you need
I am the one to believe
I am beginning and end
I am everything

Already died, by your own hand
Soon I'm alive, death I withstand
I helped you and fed you, when you needed me to
And all that I've got, was kill shame and fear

Can you believe I am Alpha and Omega
I am your guide, your heart, what you're made of(Instrumental)Propelling sour roots
Implanting neath
Parasitic antique mills
Decrepit inelegant ornaments
Habitual origin equivocal

Four crooked limbs
In creaking circuition
Instruments for the Swey
Antique gluttons exhaust
Deflate the living earthI am the Lord and I know what is sacrifice
Hook into flesh not a test
Extreme pain agitated violation excited anger ends
Spiritual masturbation location of death

Life is the opposite
Blood and flesh
Mind is positive
Lies and hate

I am your torture and I know how to kill
Agonized gravity of charming massacre
Infernal perfidy disclaimer overruled
Dishonour of the truth appetite suffocates

Rape my extent believer

Dolorous mischief for doubting
Dying to sustain a violence
Exotic scraper of soul-take
Haunting the flesh of disbelief

Speciality of breed dedicated to myself
Terminated fantasy the power of energy

Come on feel my spite...What's the purpose of the life I'm living 
Question could be the answer all along 
And the voice that calls out and keeps me 
from my sleep 
Its beckoning me from so far away 

Hear the whispering clearly, 
Tells me to seek the unknown 
If I follow where I've never gone before 
My senses scream, perception not what it should be, 
I throw my head into the wall, break from the scene 

I'm filled with visions from a blinding light 
I hear the calling far beyond my sight 
"Take me to the place where all shall be revealed, take me from my vessel unto Spatial Cosmic Fields"Stillness, besides me 
 Oblivion, controls me 
 Nomads of pain, wait salvation in vain 
 Returning, for turning 
 Of pleasure, inside me 

 Metallic devotion, resolution we pray for 

 We cannot betray them 
 Every day to flow 
 We just can worship them 
 Windows to see through 
 Weakened calculation 
 Be my last creation 

 Metallic emotion, evolution we pray for 

 Cosmic release....free war inside 

 Emptiness and sickness 
 All the way you live 
 Anguish and disease 
 Ethereal burning mist 
 We cannot betray them 
 Every day to flow 
 We just can worship them 
 Windows to see throughBecome one by destroying the others
Approach the black light strike by strike
Opponent has walked the same path
But your soul moves in different ways
Mysteries of the dark arts solved step by step
Always ahead of the game and fresh from the previous fight
Enter the gauntlet with all your weapons in use
Dealing injuries until final blow
Hands reaching from behind the bars
Swords attack from the stone wall
Defenders called off, now giving you hails
Altar at the end of the valley
You are accepted(Instrumental)Technicalities
Laid down by forensic medicine:
"Multiple stab wounds
The upper body perforated
This could not have been
An act of passion"

Blood on my face

I had to have her blood
To rejuvenate myself
I cannot stalk the streets
Until I am transformed

Entries in my journal
Clearly states
My moment of tuth
My revelation
Finally awoken
From adolescent sleep

Ready to receive
Immortality

She probably is grateful
For the gift I gave
No futile exit
No slowly rotting away

Blood on my face

Doesn't matter what you do to me
My brothers of the night will come
They will bring me down
To their realm
And initiate the rites of purging
Removing all traces
Of the inferior race
Removing all traces
Of the inferior raceSorrow envelopes. Hearts harden... under the weight of a profane prophet. I see the pillars crumble away and lost millions fall to their doom... and under a funeral shroud, a light shines through.They came from Indiana
Singing four-part harmony
They played their own horns
And introduced the "theme LP"
When I tried to give up sniffing glue
Their music soothed my swollen brain
If I am to move forward in life
I must demonstrate greater range

I admire the Four Freshmen
I stenciled their faces on my leather jacket
I admire the Four Freshmen

When they came to Reno last year
My parents released me to see the show
Proud of my newfound diversity
Fans themselves; happy to go
But there was only one Freshman left
The others had quit and died
I may appear a physical and emotional mess
But I am a sensitive man inside.Enter, House of horror 
Murder, death and torture 
Mansion of death, family secret 
Morbid incest, insane bloodlust 
Axe swings, limbs are chopped off 
Fresh blood, spraying the walls 
Hacked to pieces, gruesome slaughter 
Blood-soaked, fill the hallwaysAcid-tongued, you're lying through your teeth
Spreading hatred for what lies underneath
Your reputation matters more than their lives
Create a veil to mask the demons inside

You're weaving a web of lies
Master of your own disguise
You sit on a throne of lies
Master of your own demise

Gaining their trust until the knife's in their back
A serpent waiting for the perfect attack
Written of blood-lust is the story of you
The dagger twisted until the pain is renewed

You're weaving a web of lies
Master of your own disguise
You sit on a throne of lies
Master of your own demise

Dig yourself deeper when their's nowhere to turn
Instant decision to cast a friend down to burn
Hypocritical and no morality
Born of desire and to spread misery

You're weaving a web of lies
Master of your own disguise
You sit on a throne of lies
Master of your own demiseHey(Instrumental)"Where is the Nintendo?"
"We don't have a Nintendo. We have a Colecovision plugged into the black & white TV."
"Oh my god, this is like a third world country!"

(Excerpts from classic awesome Nintendo games)Wallstreet Gamblers, Federal Reserve: Economic manipulation and bailing out their cronies!
When are the people going to get sick of paying for the elite's greed?
Tax dollars paying off war debts and those who lines their pockets.
World government collecting their dues from global corporations and those who line their pockets!Life, tired of what I call mine, so again
Dream, leaving the space I define, so again
So, craving for something new
No, answer the void with some clue
Waiting for time to become like fragile rain, falling from the sky
Looking for ways to believe that I 'm not the same, its all in my mind
Once in a while there's a child in your eyes and mind
Now that I know I'll be ready to go when you stay
Sun, shining its rays in my eyes, so again
Close, painful to see its not right
Dream, moving to places we change
Believe nothing is surging my way
Waiting for time to become like a fragile rain, falling from the sky
Looking for ways to believe that I 'm not the same, its all in my mind
Once in a while there's a child in your eyes and mind
Now that I know I'll be ready to go when you stay
You are the sun, shining light into dim mind
Facing it all I just want to move on and grow
Breathe, slow.The violent breed now takes its course
It's a team to tame the righteous
Come creeping and crawling with funny
whispers, like a calm before the storm,
screams of lust that takes its toll.
Blood and tears, rhythm and rapture.

The violent breed now sets its mark
an ensemble of twelve out of the dark

An ensemble of twelve, sent to set the seeds of hatred,
They believe in the past the power of pain
and the wisdom sent from the one eyed mighty god

They will bring all humble lambs to the slaughter
The priest and his daughter, none forgotten all dead
Just as the one eyed wise man said.
Cause the holy doctrine will never be reprived
For leaving our fathers dead and deceived.

All dreams dies at dawn, all but this one.
An evelasting heathen rage that knows what's
to be done. An ensemble of twelve will fight
till they've won.Atmosblisters!

I stumble over hills of time to flee.. 
The vortex of death thrust upon me!
Through nightly forests of death running.. 
The flaming spirals of Cthulhu!
Rays of blinding darkness threaten to disperse my soul 
Century of burning incense hath brought the maelstrom..
The black earth once white of life.. 
Those dark angels of the stars!
Tho i do flee the vortex upon me i did hear the winged cry.. Hearken!
I did fall upon the black earth and those flaming spirals did pass my soul
Liege of Cthulhu has turned away and i did smell the incense as i was free
And i did turn pale with fear as the darkness did lift itself from my body 
Flee i did once more to realms of light wherein chaos has not found itself
As passed upon the gate.. 
I did spread thy wings..
Who would hear my pleas..
As the sky did fall black..

- Banishing of the Alal - 2:12

Begone oh kings of darkness from this world lest i conjure lords of the sun against 
thine power. Open from the gate thee lord of the sun who is known by thee name as 
Shammash of the sun.. The veils of maelstrom have cloaked my soul
Lords of fire, i call to thee
Fire raging, the sun is burning bright
Power of light flows in me!
Let it be told that i did stand against
And those who raised upon did fall
With blinding rays of light i lashed
So shall it be told as written upon the sky

- Of Magick and Demons - 3:18

I lept through the gate with rage upon my eyes
Stand i will against the armies of darkness
I did stumble out into the darkened earth with flames of light upon my wrists
As i did leap through the sky and descend upon the dark waters of Cthulu
Across the water i walked and did not sink in the name of light let it be known
A beast did ascend from the skies upon me and i did howl with fiery light crests
Arming myself with shields of light the beast did howl upon lord of darkening skies
The sky did turn black as the powers of Xul spread across this earthen plane of light
The name of the beast would be unknown and unspoken for fear of incantations
Seas did swell and darken with the beast to send me to the ocean of dark dreams
I did rise from the ocean and call to the sky in the name of light
Barra Xul Malda o' lord of darkness i call fourth his name in purity 
These black dimensions called domaination and manifestation
Manifest the names of Xul in forms of power and flame of Hades
Coalesce these names of hatred tho the beast did become 9 of death
They did surround my presence and look upon me with ashen eyes
Spoke through my mind the beasts did call all to one and i did fall
Into the dark seas of darkened earth..
As i did fall the lightness of my soul did call unto my body to rise once more...
As i did rise from the seas!
Into the sky i lept as rays of light flew from my body blinding eyes of death... 
So i did strike fourth in light!
Death befall the sorcery of those who may not be spoken the form of truth... 
As i did asail the dark skies!
Hear me o' lords of power i do call fourth from the sky powers of true light... 
The sky did open with light!

- The Darkening Seas - 4:23

The beasts rose in form of one tho i did raise shields of light...
Swords of darkness did impale my soul as i did cry out in pain
Destructive storms, winds of heralding bane cast me out
The circle of Cthah was formed in a name, shape and number
Veils of darkness did cloak my soul
Winds of fire did appear before
Ia Zi Annga Kanpa Maskim Xul
Ashen eyes did stare upon the earth
The skies did turn black yet once more
Into the dark waters we did fall as i did hear the name of the beast being that whom is Cthulhu...
As did i look upon the seas and called out in names of Xul.. Hearken lords of light.I sat under the tree
When my Master spoke to me
His words froze my blood
As he told the truth.

Under Yggdrasil
I want to know who I am
Under Yggdrasil
Tomorrow's awaiting, heading to paradise

I cried for the ones I lost
My heart bleeding for my Brothers
Oh great Lord in Valhalla
Give me Strength to survive.

What do I see each time?
Is this my destiny?
Is this all thats left for me
Confusion and bad memories?

close window(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I know the world could be a better place
I know the truth is hiding beneath a moonlit sky
But the lights are shining bright right trough the darkness of the night
Who knows the answers to all that we are longing for ?

I know know the days they stand aside the night
I know the worlds revolving at one thousand miles an hour
Some many things I`ve seen - so many tiles I can`t assign
You always wanted to know before you have to go

All minds in one they can see what is left to find and
Carry the weight of this world for a timeless moment

I know the world could be brighter place
I know the world moves on an endless track
Some many things I`ve seen - I`m just an ordinary man
I hope to realize by using erveryone

All minds in one they can see what is left to find and
Carry the waste of this world for a single moment
All things must change - full steam ahead

Let the light shine into the dark of our minds
Let the light shine in to warm up the nights
Let the minds connect to one magic eye
Let the minds control the chaos inside
Oh, it`s bright I can see it alll
Clear in my dreams
Let the light shine into the mysteries of life
Let the light flow into
Nobody knows what we will find

All minds in one they can see what is left to find and
Carry the weight of this world for a timeless moment
All things must change - full steam aheadCold is my yell 
As cold as sites of ancient fires 
Like hell 
My mind is burning with recollections of great days 
My spirit's just the fierce force of northern gales 
It seeks to break away like hell 

The flame within my soul is flaring up again 
There's no more doubt in my heart no chains 
Strength is my nature firm will to win has been collected 

I feel approach of last and fatal battle 
The sky is lightened with queer crimson dashes 
I will pour out my hate and threaten 
My foes my wrath my hate will turn them into ashes 

The shadows gather round and 
Fill my soul with gloom 
They never would compound 
So I accept my doomDripping blood as violent rages on, engulfing our soils
Death is here, ringing fatality of civilization
Massacre, the murders at random, attempted genocide Thousand years, social paralysis, fathomless irony

Humankind in conflicting nature, the beauty and the beast
Death to share, bringing fatality to civilization
Ideologies and social systems based on human theories
So basically, we're all into products of our corrupted brains!

Deep in the void of our hollow hearts
Is there any space left for souls to rest?

Deep in the void of our wounded minds
Is there any chance left for souls to live?

"No time to clean your bloody hands,
the stains are there in your own blood!"

Many years we've tried to look ahead and find some solutions,
but once again they fail miserably, yet life's still going on
Is there any space left for souls to rest?A brazen head. Engraved with sigils. Emblems

By Itay Necrofog Krasilshikov

The moon is as my spirit
Eaten away slowly
The two wolves hunt forth
Bringing forth my doom

The iron ring
Immortally forged by the gods
Mjolnir struck the flaming lava
Its sparks lit up my soul with lust

Fettered now, the cold metal closes upon me
An icy shiver runs in my very bones

A starless night
Not one glimpse of hope in the grim black torture

Harpies tantalizing me with my own flame
Pulling to earth, where the wolves pray to feast again

I unleash the bloodthirsty beasts with a hopeful grin
Break the ring of hissing corrupted ice
Devour all in your path, mighty lustful creatures
For none could stand in the way of Hell

I stand to face thy feeble corpse
I can feel your clotted wet blood between my fingers
Your ultimate stare aloft gleaming with hope for mercy
The same stare crushed under my armoured body

Wishing to forge myself into the ring 
Its pieces lie broken on the filthy ground
Never would the parts join forth once more
Ragnarok brought the end of Mjolnir and mine

Wolves slaughtered at midnight upon where once stood the church
Unable to face the ending that forever haunts these shoresd0wn

The ground. lying on the
Ground, begging for a living,
Sadness in it's eyes. misery,
... suffering,... when you
Cannot fall deep downer, life
Will be a punishment. your
Future will be your end. and
Life will be a memory. they
Are living, without being,
Cast out, from a society. that
Will not see, that will not
Hear. from a society where
They've got no place. no
Place to live, no place to
Stay. how could they exist?
In such a misery. living
Each day in uncertainty
Lying on the ground
Begging for a living
Sadness in it's eyes,
Misery,... suffering,.. open
Your eyes(Eklundh)

There's no way you can see it
I'm acting like everything's cool
But, hell, I'm about to burst

Got two delicate options
Either I zip of the venom
Or else I will die of thirst 

Down, going down to my inner revolution
Revolution inside 

Got a nice little conflict
A riot inside my head
I'm at war with myself all alone 

My eyes tell you nothing
But I'm closing in on myself
And it scares me to the bone

Down, going down to my inner revolution
Revolution inside(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I've seen your eyes you better feel me through my memories
The only place I'll never call home it feels so right
I swear I heard your voice but I'm seeying ghosts tonight
It's my bitter end, I do again

So are you blind and seeying nothing? Through my memories
Is what you've seen to much to take, so you cry
The more I try to look away, the more I'm staring here
It's my bitter end, I do again

What I've done am I losing it?
I saw you run, you run away
It's my bitter end, I do again

I can't disguise the look inside my eyes falling into the night
I can believe I'm losing my life, it bring me down
This time I've no choice but I still see you shine
It's my bitter end, I do againA perfect killer escaped from wild places, where man destroyed the equilibrium of nature. 
Another disease frightened human kind and science must study and stop this enemy.

... but somewhere in the world, he finds a host... in hospital a patient is very sick...
The scientists from level 4 discover a new virus.

The brain's destroyed and body's shacking
The arms are contorted and eyes are bleeding
The liver's growing and then explodes 
The kiddneys are filled with bloody gore
The corpse's spread control is lost
And the virus seeks another host
This epidemic can't be rejected
Thousand of people are infected.Johnson & Johnson

Holy shit!These walls faced no foes
Nor challengers to the throne
Harmony and peace,
encased in a labyrinth of stone

Frescos fall around us,
and ceilings turn to dust
As the incisors of destiny,
sink deep into us

All the pottery we painted,
and the pillars we erected
Will anyone ever know of them?

For where we paved roads,
and convinced water to flow
is failing through the cracks again

Our mastery of crop,
and proto-government
Will be buried in the memories,
of no living Mediterranean

We will be forgotten, we will be lost
A sunken island, legend to noneWhy can't I 
Just be fallen
from my grace
history erased
Living in shadow
feeding on thee
All this time 
never really free

I choose my death
without regret
Can not die in this life
all though I tryI'm sitting in this cell for something I didn't do
And all I can think of is baby I think of you
Don't worry baby coming back for you

There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout

Now I've got the chance I don't care about what I do
When I done them things I done them just for you
And now I'm getting out coming back for you

There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout

Well now I'm over the wall I'm nearly home
I'm coming through that door coming back to you
Now I'm nearly home nearly back for you

There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakoutDon't leave me, know I fall
Don't cheat me, bad lucks following me
No praying for me, I've been waiting so long
Poking me while losing and folding
Now they're winning, gloating
Don't look at me holding on

I crown myself?
Crown yourself fool
They captured you with lies

Empower something, then that something drools
Obsessed by thrusting
Obsessed and cruel
Devoured something, then that something bloomed
Then I stopped the faking of love inside
That love is doomed

Fly, what am I waiting for?
Why live life through envy?
I keep asking, what am I craving for?
Wasting my mind.

Wasting, wasting my mind
Swallowing, swallowing my tongue

Why can't you love me for me?
Why can I not stand myself?
Why must you leave when I need?
Why I ask you?  Why?

Because you found yourself
I found myself?
Fool they captured you with lies

No, I'm something devised and crumbling?
Cure me
Why?The ancient Templars lived here alone
The chapel in the forest was their home
They were mighty and glorious were their lives
So the aristocracy wanted them to die

Down in the forest of the ghosts
I can hear the ringing of the swords
Fading screams of fallen warriors
Sounds of cutting meat and braking bones

The battle was long and no one survived
Died by the sword, others eaten by wolves
The ground was bloody and filled by corpses
The stench of death cursed the forest

Even now they rise from their graves
To fight their battle once again
When the ghosts in the chapel ring the bells
They are awakening the evil right from hell
 
War, war, war, war(Instrumental)As i gaze into the sky
I can see the ravens fly
And as i hear the northern call
In battle is where i will fall
When axes clash and blood is shed
My path is paved by the dead
In battle i will reign supreme
On victory i am so keen

As i gaze into the sky
I can see the ravens fly
And as i hear the northern call
In battle is where i will fall

In battle we will stand or fall
Waiting for the northern call
To asgard we're gonna fly
Ravenlike we'll soar to the sky

In battle
I will reign supreme
In battle
We will stand or fall
In battle

In battle we will stand or fall
Waiting for the northern call
To asgard we're gonna fly
Ravenlike we'll soar to the skyAll the things, the round, the square and the slow 
Pointing down to a corner far below 
And the light with darkness of memories 
I see it bend, coiling in ecstasy 
The gathering of mass (or the tainted ones) 
Unite with a star, in horizons I watch it pass 
I feel the beating and I feel the beat 
Bodies are battered, swarming in heat 
Centurions of the lowest class 
Swaying back and forth with the grass 
Then once again we come 
Then once again we come through the sun(Eklundh)

I am into showbiz, I am a road manager
D'ya know a sexy chick? I got a pass for her
Touring can be boring, but not for me
You got to entertain yourself, I got a special hobby:

I fuck with the support band, I remember when
We had a shitty little group, called "Freak Kitchen"
I'm always in the mode for, let's say, any kind of dope
I asked the drummer if he wanted some, but he said "nope"

Well I couldn't believe what I just heard
The drummer of this group was this astonishing nerd
The singer and guitarist and the bass player as well
If I only had the guts I'd tell 'em: go to hell!

Instead I turned around and asked a guy from the crew
To go and get a girl that we all can screw
You see, I an asshole and a real hypocrite
And my wife and kids don't know hippo-shit

I rather be a jerk, than being hip like you
I rather be a jerk, than do the shit you do
I rather be a jerk, than snort 'til I turn blue
I rather be a jerk, I rather be a jerk 

An orgy a day keeps the Mrs away
I'm a road manager in a giant ashtray
And when my conscience knocks on the door
I bury myself in horse as a cure
And a prostitute, then I shoot some more

I rather be a jerk, than being hip like you
I rather be a jerk, than do the shit you do
I rather be a jerk, than snort 'til I turn blue
I rather be a jerk, I rather be a jerkI wish I could wake up and leave this behind
I'm stuck in a nightmare the door i can't find
All good has deceived me, I'm into decay
My mind is fading more, it does not obey

Feeling life is hard
Waving me away
I'm a foul burden
Cursing that day

My lonely venture
Has no delay
It's a journey into
Languish and decay

I wish I could wake up and leave this behind
To turn the dark times and your demise combined
To conquer our struggle and survive the night
I fear all, your absence, I can't win this fightCOCK! I just went into Denny's with 2 mini-guns! (2 mini-guns!) 

Shredding human bodies like shitty toliet paper-rah

I smell their blood, fueled by my hate of Gary Coleman-ah!Default decline ruled by dead fires 
Don't wait, think last, act now, destroy 

No fire, no smoke, no thought, act now 
No time, paths fork, paths end, destroySay, can you see the cross?
Inverted solemnly
Symbol for the goat
Of a thousand young

Six six six
Evoke the king of hell
Strike the death knell
Death knell

Say, can you hear the chimes?
Tolls now for the end
Bells call out their doom
As victor reaches womb

Sex sex sex
Receive the beast of evil
Of evil...

Can you say his name?
Carrier of the light
Legions of this seed
A child a spouse will feed

S-A-T-A-N
Under spell
of death knell
Death knell(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Rigidly perpetuated unawares 
Inherent abuse takes shape 
Submitted for strategic 
Rape 

Trace the steps of contentedness with empty traditions 
So called alternative is nothing but more of the same 
Possessive nature of the mutual farce that is harmony battery 

Denounce our repression or save face?From your body. From your arms. Never to return. A mistake. A burden. Anew.Ignoring me presence
You get lost in the whispers of the birds
that they arrive with my spring, 
leaving me alone in the shades 
that they will never end up 
of tormenting my soul.

I will believe in that false hope
and I will wait to that caress my face again.
I will wander alone for the humid corridors for your tears, 
remembering their fragrance, 
thinking of your even unknown face for my, 
remembering their last words,
reason for which I burn.

I will be the lost ghost
That walks eternally in their dreams, 
keeping secrets and forgetting feelings.
Wanting to fall in the eternal dream, 
entering in the illness, 
falling in their bloodstained hands, 
I am surrounded by the darkness.

I am not able to see the road, 
I will never rest in peace, 
neither I get up again, 
alone a white sadness will accompany me, 
and it will cover me with their lukewarm melancholy, 
while I wait what will never arrive.(Instrumental)ALL DREAMS ARE DEAD

(music by Alex Pishikin; lyrics by Alex Pishikin)

you feel emptiness
 overfilling you
 killing your emotions
 apathy to the world around
 no desires
 the loathsome feeling
 of absence of the meaning of life
 depression is just deepening

all dreams are dead
 life devoid of sense
 all dreams are dead
 what for is this pain?
 what for is it all?
 all dreams are dead

the pale-grey sky
 has burst into the rain
 muddy drops
 are trickling down
 the picture devoid of colours
 faceless mass
 of useless people
 is moving to it's death

smouldering deeply inside
 hatred fire is kindling all more strongly
 consciousness turbidity
 mental disorder
 chaotic stream of thoughts
 fragments recuring to my memory
 in futile attempts
 to find a justification for myself

having given up the last hope
 having lost the belief in tomorrow
 the cold blade pierces the flesh
 blood starts to ooze out of a wound(Instrumental)There's no need for a self in utero.
Personas.
No sex. A body blank as snow.
The first girl had five hearts on each hand.
The ideal, hard pressed to be.

If you dream me, I dream you.
Speak my name, you know me.

Female. Thee inner female at all cores.
When I am her, who am I?

Lay near now, let's make vows.
True love waits for sundown.

In the Motherland, no people exist.
All sole & vague.
So lovely this way.
We've agreed.Once upon a time in Scandinavistan

Grumpy, tired with eyes blood red
Take a breath as the therapist said

Bingo-playing sex-workers and curry ooze
A molotov cocktail of venereal blues

Kama sutra and decomposing seaweed stew
Diastolic blood pressure higher than the IQ

Shaking, starving, running out of juice
Better stop by the tandoori moose

Once upon a time in Scandinavistan

Illegal propaganda transmission from a submarine
Get your head smashed by a feminist teen

A public intelligence Officer too tired to be afraid
As the anti-socials are gearing up for the parade

Colonial law states it's an utter disgrace
Committing Nuisance in a public place

Vomit, drunkenness and potent fury
There is no cure for the muddy streets of Gautampuri

Once upon a time in Scandinavistan

Wear helmet!!
Head is not replaceable
Wear helmet!!
Head is not replaceable
Wear helmet!!
Head is not replaceable

Only one head per lifetime...[Lyrics: - Coss]

And so the silence shall fall Enter O warrior of the past Greet thee with jubilation Rise hero to this mass Slayer of mighty beasts Please this crowd -with butchery

Come forth 'O demons killer of man Go forward beasts of blood lust Take these offerings blessed to you Prey upon the weakened one Wretched demons burst from the gate Feast upon the human man

[Solo: - Macey]
[Solo: - Macey]

Roman god of the arena Surrounded by your hunters See eyes glaze with the dreams of death Their hunger commands they feed Attack this human for the flesh Appease thy ravenous beasts

Silence falls on the sea of man Blood spills from the butchered beasts Saturate the arena sands Wounded warrior stands Rises arm in victory And the ovation fallsBlack is the night, metal we fight
Power amps set to explode
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records the first note.
We chime the bell, chaos and hell
Metal for maniacs pure.
Fast melting steel, fortune on wheels
Brain haemorrhage is the cure
For BLACK METAL
lay down your soul to the gods rock `n' roll

Freaking so wild, nobody's mild
Giving it all that you've got.
Wild is so right, metal tonight
Faster than over the top.
Open the door, enter hells core
Black is the code for tonight
Atomic force, feel no remorse
Trunk up the amps now it's night
BLACK METAL
lay down your soul to the gods rock `n' roll
metal ten fold through the deadly black hole
riding hells stallions bareback and free
faking our chances with raw energy

Come ride the night with us
Rock hard and fight
United my legions we stand
Freak hard and wild for us
Give up your souls
Live for the guest satans band

Against the adds, black metal gods
Fight to achieve our goal
Tasting a spell, leather and hell
Black metal gods rock `n' roll
Building up steam, nuclear screams
War-heads are ready to fight
Black leather hounds, faster than sound
Metal our purpose in life.
BLACK METAL
lay down your soul to the gods rock `n' roll
black metalSome say they can light my way
Along the distance of the desert grey
Some say they can ease your pain
Some believe in they are safe and sound

Sunlight keeps me holding on
In compensation for the midnight days
No place I would rather be
Only one thing that is left to say

My hands are tied cause of the mortal life
Don`t close my eyes to see the other ones die
We tremble softly when the fortune smiles
We spin so many wheels to come alive
I fear the momentary walk into nowhere

Moments unreal through lenses of fear
Faces look scary when we turn off the lights
What makes us cling to a small grain of sand ?
Why do we long for a life without end ?

Moments - wasted away
All disappear in the dust of this place
What makes us cling to a small grain of sand ?
I never wanted to feel it this way

See them crawling from here to there
On the surface of the world they share
Defending secrcets they can`t explain
All is still insecure !

My hands are tied cause of the mortal life
Don`t close my eyes to see the other ones die
We tremble softly when the fortune smiles
We spin so many wheels to come alive
I see them hopelessly fall into nowhereOne more bender last night
Can see it today through
My blurred sight
I feel the booze in me
Diffusing its poison slowly
Pathetic animal life
Wrenched in duality
Two egos, permanent strife
Abandoning reality

Paralyzed.. My body cries -
Hypnotized...
But my soul denies
Paralyzed.. My body dies -
Hypnotized...
By my own lies
True bitches live in the bottle
Fooling me has become their
Struggle
It's always the same refrain
I drink till the last drop
East my brain

I detest the one in the mirror
Am I you, are you me?
I dive back in the bottle,
Deeper
Or maybe out of me?

I hate to see those eyes
And that wilted mouth
That lies
That ripped and dirty skin
The man and the jinn within
Regressing from dry to dry
But keeping on boozing
Meanwhile
If you were to meet me
You'd say:
Life left his body erstwhile
A tree, without a mouth to
Swallow, and without eyes to
See this decay, has got a
Better chance to welcome
The morrow cause his roots
Will never betray

Never sober over the
Past years
Never sober is better:
No more hangovers
There's no future,
No past life to tell

And in the nights to come
I'll booze as wellHorrendous thruth and logic
Too true for most to understand
We know the power within us
A key to things great and grand

We are the keepers of the strenght
Nature will serve us well
We rule the earth and heavens
And surely we reign in hell

Wisdom and might is for few
And we carry the flame
Bringers of death and new beginning
Universe will never be the same(Instrumental)A green way of unrealized aspirations
Gloomy thoughts revolve on it
Those on the brink
Misty figures tired of life
Where are they going?
Why are they silent?
They seem to be so little real
Dispersing slowly
Covered by dusk
The dusk that''s not a presage of anything good
Saying the truth I don''t see them now and never
But I know they exist(Instrumental)Desynchronization

I'm staring at a gigantic building
Silo-shaped, shining tower towards the sky
I see it counting the every our
Enormous power rising high

I am the world
Symmetry revolves around me
Build a new world
Within this earth, must be our salvation

A reflection I see in this tower of time
As I move closer I see me

Detach me from this wicked place
Entwine me with the everlasting space
Let me gaze upon existens
I want to be the omnipotent god
Desynchronize from mother earth
To last forever
Bending time
Released

When I have become the universe
I shall sweep it clean from every living force
Planets will implode
Gallaxies will be swept into blackholes
Desynchronize the universe(Instrumental)--Chorus:
Someone somewhere scorned
Never will forget
Someone somewhere scorned
Never can forget

Burning, No desire
No friends, Inside my mind

I'll never change, Yet still you burn
I'll never change, And I feel scorned

--Chorus:

Burning, In our mind
Inside my mind, Burns desire

--Repeat 2nd verse:

Scorned

--Chorus:

Burning, No desire
Your mind, Inside my mind

I'll never change, And I feel scorned (?)
I'll never change, I must be burned(Instrumental)Incubating the dark seed of Mephistopheles, I am chosen. The shattering screams of undead echo throughout the endless caverns of my brain. My
conscience is set for the fall of humanity. Thrust into a river of souls I sift through the bloated carcasses. Searching for those worthy of reanimation. Ten legions the master has asked for, and that he shall receive. Ferocious flames engulf the sea. Clouds of black loom ominously o'er towering cliffs. Carnivorous mites rain down upon the masses feasting upon their flesh. With them they bring the iron fist of Belial. Boils raping the flesh of infants, those that survive are devoured. I
am myself... A MONSTER! None will survive my merciless fury. Boils raping the flesh of infants, those that survive are devoured. I am myself... A MONSTER! None will survive my merciless fury. Undeath! The only escape from a worthless life. I've crushed thousands of worlds, this one's just another wasted existence. Thrust into a river of souls I sift through the bloated carcasses, searching for those worthy of reanimation. Condemning those that inhabit this plagued rock, I wipe the earth clean of this infestation of life.Fell asleep 
Broke the vow 
You're traveling again 
Seeing things 
You're not supposed to see 
Into the further you go 

Feeling safe 
Thinking to yourself: 
This is but a dream 
I'll wake up soon 
It will over soon 
They'll stop that from happening 

Went too far 
And now you're trapped 
In the realm of penance, grief and woe 
They crave life 
They knew you'd come 
And now you're their only hope 

They want to be able to feel again 
They want to be able to feed again

He has no job but he's trying
And the eyes outside
That see his plight
They relish what he's losing

The time passes with no end in sight
And it's hard to see the light
In a storm

But the shark sees underneath the water
And the shark knows what can be gained
By the death of another

Her eyes blink
And her thoughts race
As she tries to fight the tears from her eyes
But like the moth to the flame
Without fear of the pain
The sex overwhelmes the shame

The time passes with no end in sight
And it's hard to see the light
Through the dark of a storm

But the shark sees underneath the water
And the shark knows what can be gained
By the death of anotherFinally, the horrible river has crawled back to bed
Leaving our bog like streets now damned with the dried up dead
Did you think it wise to build on the swollen banks of this delta?
When news surfaces of the latest death toll, will you rethink your new capitol?
Will our streets ever be dry again?
Festering pools left behind will be the death of this city
Breeding things with wings will only be the beginning
When your governor rowed down J street to the inauguration could he smell the cholera?

Chained to the past, dreaming with the liberation. 
Seeing itself through mirrors. Death before the life. 
above the laws of the man.

Blinded by its faith. Visions of an altered life. 
And days where I only knew silence.
Dreams that I lived awake. Drowned by the sorrow and sand.

I am the creator of all the destroyed. I built my own prison.
I looked for in the blind eyes. I listened it preach and I didn`t learn. 
Was I safe?

My beliefs kept firm. This juggernaut can`t be stopped. 
Inside me, the dark is my freedom. The bitterness above truths 
That it never existed and won`t be.

A trip without promises. Union between stillness and the change. 
An interminable trip, of all our ages. 
Beyond desires of blood, breath and sacrifice.The spiders dead in their webs
The birds fallen from the sky
the monstrous putrescence,
physical and moral,
of everything in sight
Silver strips of bone
golden adipose tissue
Striated rubies of muscle now obsolete
The indignant refusal to countenance
That which is guaranteed
but now, upon receipt, cannot be believedon this road wrapped by darkness 
twisted bends who inspire fear 
i walk, beating heart 
this heart who create beyond the edges 

i can see people 
who was have a role 
through my time 
and who now, flow in my blood 

on the road of ancient souls 
i feel excited and terrified 
this reality mixed with my toughs 
guide me since i am born 

on this road wrapped by darkness 
twisted bends who inspire fear 
i am the public of my vices 
and of the desire who have illusioned me 

i will walk in it for eternity 
this road who form a circle 
thy circle without end 
theater of my instincts 

on the road of ancient souls 
i feel excited and terrified 
this reality mixed with my toughs 
guide me since i am bornWargon the wizard
His heart was set on war
Against the evil bens
He set foot out his door

The king in his hand
His beard in his fist
His journey was that to be grim
And it all depends on...

He was a majestic master
Of magic and might
He uses spells
To cast away the light

The Ben was an evil man
He was a jolly sword
But today he'd meet his hand
As Wargon brought him war

Wargon the wizard
War-gon-the-wiz-ard
He was a wizard.
Wargon the wizard
War-gon-the-wiz-ard

Yep.

The Ben's eyes
Were full of fright
He was a weakly man
Who did not even fight

He was an easy kill
His blood an easy spill
Wargon was the wizard of war
And he will forever kill 

As the Ben lay slayed
Wargon was victorious
He had spared no one
The spells were atrocious

The land was bleak
The war was won
We'll let you know
In the next war

Wargon the wizard
War-gon-the-wiz-ard
He was a wizard.
Wargon the wizard
War-gon-the-wiz-ard

Yeah!

He does the work of the Anti-Ben
He does it with a smile
His name...is Wargon
And he'll fight until he diesThe Oath

Oh Heimdall, my shield in the baygone fight
be thanked for your aid last night.
Were you not there against wrathful foe
would the life out of my body go.
For the day when my life I leave
Today this promise you I give:
On the day when you the
Gijallarhorn blow
I will be by you with rage like a fiery glow.
We affirm our alliance anew
and I fight until death beside you.this is a giant war
the roahr of guns - near and far
this is only moral rot
guts collapse by one shot

so many losses to bear
it hurts forever
we still have so much to fear

this is a giant war
the roahr of guns - near and far
this is only moral rot

Prophecy / Destiny

no time for peace - no hope
eternal war on the whole globe
if you make your final breath
even so what you see you should believeI dreamt of god
He turned his gaze unto me
I stared
His eyes of fire
Into my mind
I was blinded
Was what I saw the mind of god?

I remember what I saw
Mere words could not illuminate
How will my mind contain
Thoughts so alien?
Monstrous visions
Of the vastness of void and time
And bear
The Ululation
Which lies beyond
The final wall

In the spiral
Where all beginnings end
Lurks a horror
A palsy upon the face of god
Expressing
The uncreation of all times
When all becomes naught
In the minds of the world eater

Getting drunk, getting laid you might say, or are you taking it dead serious

Give it up
There is no reason
Stop wasting your time
We have no purpose, we're obsolete

As if you really cared anyway, about the rest of humanity
All comes down to the same thing, the little thing called egocentria

Give it up
There is no reason
Stop wasting your time
We have no purpose, we're obsolete

Stay behind the line
Do not interfere
Stay behind the line
Do not interfere

Your actions are totally useless, no one cares in the end
Why try to help people that don't want it

Give it up

Stop wasting your time
We have no purpose, we're obsoleteBeneath the floor of geneology
Holds truth in this hollow blood
Vanishing from comprehension
Is the proof of the settled way
Burn in your mythical land
Let the fires consume your "souls"
The foul stench of rotting thought
Floats amidst in the wintering cold
I can remember when
You meant existence to me
The whithering travesties
Brand flesh with her sickening sign
Love me for molded skin
Until the flames are permitted to burn
Melting unbridled lust
Forever cursed by your bleeding eyes
Reject me...Hate me
No pain too weak
No force too strong
Degrade me...Rape my mind
No thought too harsh
Release the lions
Experience the casualties and
Feel the pain

Sole survivors of common sense

Greatness seen in naked eyes
Until their close demise

Dead, feeble species
Claimed as just
But walking blind
So few words need to be said...
Your primitive lives explain all
Irradicating braincells

Shutter to think upon it
But, yet, one can't avoid
The muttering of mindless nonsense
Kill the local idiot

Poisoning our cups

Wounds of christ carried by the saints
Wounds of christ

Only the most noble followers are blessed with this pain

Back lashings bleed as the blood odor reeks of flowers

"I am who you want me to be"
"Will you give your Ancient Knowledge?"
"I will be your knowledge, if you give me your soul"
"I am the ancient Mother, Karidwen
I am life as well as the death
for me, all things have been created
I am the daughter, the bride, the mother, the old
I am the ages of life, the changes of the seasons
Free me from the mortals' deceive and come to me"
Her ethereal embrace wrapped me up
annihilating my will
so, I was in her and she was in me
and I found myself into the Sacred Vault
The Ancient Mother is free again
She'll conclude Her Great Opera
'cause I've broke her mortal chains
gaining the Truth, losing my freedom...(Instrumental)I'm feeling, unneeded,
I'm seeing, believing,
so that I can be but nothing else,
maybe I'm a loser, no victory,
'cause I'm in it for life.
I'm in it for life [x3] 

Deceiver, believer,
can't finish what you've started,
try feeling the pain of someone who suffers more,
I feel the pain of everything, it's what I am,
I'm in it for life,
and I feel it for life,
I'm in it for life,
I feel it for life.

III. SHRED THE DEAD
 
Black dread, undead
Crawling from the crypts
Ragged claws scratch coffin lids
A rancid stink as tombs emit
Tongues slick over glutinous lips
With bloodlust in their minds
We grab our decks and grab our dicks
Drop in and bust a grind
 
Smash our boards into the undead hoards
The rotten fiends are gored... Shred the Dead
Mushed up guts are stuck all in our trucks
But we don't give a fuck... Shred the Dead
 
One-eyed wallride
Drunken mutants shred the gnar
Collapsing clotted craniums
With kick-flips eldritch and bizarre
Unfazed by the fusillade
Blitzkrieg from the dead brigade
They'll never stop until we die
So send them back into the grave

Smash our boards into the undead hoards
The rotten fiends are gored... Shred the Dead
Mushed up guts are stuck all in our trucks
But we don't give a fuck... Shred the Dead
 
We launch into the fray with rusty axes set to "slay"
And shatter each and every vertebrae
McTwist was missed, busted ankle, broken wrist
Dentures cracked as concrete's kissed
 
Crash the swarm of wretched shambling forms
Ripened limbs are torn... Shred the Dead
Maggots creamed as mildewed skulls are reamed
And every cube is gleamed... Shred the Dead
Backs to the Wall against the undead thrall
So let's just kill 'em all... Shred the Dead
Clouds of flies as bodies pile up high
And our escape is nigh... Shred the Dead(Instrumental)Kill how many do I have to kill
To get rid of them
I see them telling lies
In every church they lie
They have no future in my eyes
Kiss this world goodbye
I am coming after you
You know your god won't help

Torture I would love to torture them
Hurt them with my hands
Their pain will be my joy
I will do everything I can
To make them disappear
No place for them on earth
No chance to have rebirth
This is what I want

Free from Christ. Free from god
Free from you
Free from all god's children
Victory. To my dark world
I watch you die
I masturbate upon your graves

Hate I will show you hate
Bleed I love to see you bleed
Gone now and forever

Free from Christ. Free from god
Free from you
Free from all god's children
Victory. To my dark world
I watch you die
I masturbate upon your graves

Satanic victory
KillFighting just a good fight and you will break the steel
So if you gonna rock me, the altar of rock is where you kneel
the place where you kneel.

Shake at every footstep, the sun will shine on you
You try to catch the sunlight and soon you know the truth
so you know the truth

You've been looking for a free life
The youth is rushing through your veins
As you're taking just a low ride
Now they see you running

Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You search no answer
Wild in the streets - You are no gambler

Fighting just a good fight as you had met the gang
Tell me what you fight for, when will it have an end
Will it have an end

Isn't it a story, you listen to every day
And isn't it the same price that everybody pays
That's paid every day

You've been looking for a free life
The youth is rushing through your veins
As you're taking just a low ride
Now they see you running

(Chorus)
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You search no answer
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler

Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You search no answer
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets - You ain't no gambler
Wild in the streets.Take what little love comes
and be deserving.
And when it's not enough, be servile.

The needle's eye shrinks things strangeways.
Ash to dust. It's all considered.

Draw me down the moon, love.
Take the risk.
And what it's not enough of, we must submit.I feel nothing for you
Fighting on the barreled sea
It's your battle
While I'm drinking its water

While you're sinking
Others are rising
Etherless dream will
Cover your rotten soul

Nobody will remember
To that kind of shit
You will be remembered
Just by your sins

Why don't you see
That the power is mine
Your end won't affect to
Anyone but me

Shadow burns your eyes
In your reserved sanctuary
When you scream
Vultures're hollowing
Your eyes and heart
Deepening your requital

When your voice follows then
Your conviction will be true
Falling will be no more
You will be done
After all you can return
To life which is not yours
Your chaos will embitter
The life of the servants of light

Who knows what you are
Who fears your time
Who follows your sign
No one because you are no moreThe black it came and destroyed
Unknowingly
The innocent, the precious, till they kill
Thousands
Carnage
The Innocent carnageBehold the man 
Who lives his life in shameless misery 
His worn hands 
Tell a tale of a life of endless pain 
Broken bones 
Crack and shift under the weight of the world 
But his smile stays 
A twisted veil; beneath he hides his hate 

Head held high 
In the shadows 
Child of Plight's 
Nameless hero 

Never rest 
Knowing full well his work is never done 
And if his angel were to fall 
He will have failed

O darkness, remove thyself from before him. 
O light, bring the light to me. 
Pshai that is in the abyss, bring the light to me. 
O Osiris who is in the Neshem-boat, bring in the light to me. 

These four winds that are without, bring in the light to me. 
O thou whose hand is the moment that belongeth to these hours, bring in the light to me.

"Anubis, into amenti, onwards, to Osiris!"Blue haze ghosts from the vlass bottles
Shapes to abstract nebulas

The artists skin is wrinkled in the morning
But the eyes pulsate as stars
The strength of my gaze shall carry far

A mortal creature breaking borders
The seed of infinity in the dead flesh
Thge claen paper is so young
You must stain your youth to create

Now when I sit on the steps of my tower
My fingertips turn to dust
But when I raise my gaze
It rides with comets forever....Exaudi

Until we make the choice
Do we let him burn
Or in the mire turn?

Stuff his mouth with rags
Open all his bags

He don't need it anyway

"Well, I say "ay", pa"
"Verm and Chicken?"
"We say "ay", pa"

Take one of his ears
In case his kin is near
It's easier to pay
When only part of him's away

"Rash?"
"Well, I say "ay", pa"
"Verm and Chicken?"
"We say "ay", pa"

Into the quagmire

Says here right on this here sign:
"No trespassin'!"(Instrumental)I still remember when to live was worth my whole life.
It's sad when you realize how small you are to shout.
How much we lived? How much we died over the helplessness?
We're just a sad machine and all we have to do is to survive.

Survive inside.
To die outside.

And then you'll be there
to crush me, to kill me again.

How much we won? How much we lost beyond our limits?
We are going to get drowned in all these pools of blood.
Destroying, loving, and forgetting all the reasons.
No more beliefs to trust, who will purify my sight?

I was born just to:

Survive inside.
To die outside.

And then you'll be there
to crush me, to kill me again.

'Till the end we will try to survive.
No more feelings inside to spill out.

I am going to

Survive inside.
To die outside.

And then you'll be there
to crush me, to kill me again.Foreword:

The year of 1462 a time of feudal crisis
Years of plague and epidemic, following the wars.
Long-lasting conflicts provoked by Turkish raids.
Fights for the crown and disputes between great kingdoms.
Weakened and exhausted the whole continent ... earth soaking with blood.
Every land has it's own Count and every Count has his own interests.
What cause could possibly unite so many
quarrelling enemies under one flag?Take me home
I do not want to be in the tomb
Angels light of the sun and call me The Son

You are in my power, forever
I am your personal devil, the tempter

Love me sinner, this hole is your new home
Love me sinner, your home forever is Sheol
Love me sinner, enjoy eternal hellfire
Love me sinner, we are waiting for the lake of fire

"But the sons
of the kingdom
shall be cast
out into
the outer darkness;
there, there shall
be weeping and the
gnashing of teeth" (Mt. 8:12)

I do not want to be
Where there is gnashing of teeth

"Woe to you
who laugh now,
for you shall
mourn and weep" (Lk. 6:25)

"God opposes
the proud but gives
grace to the humble" (Jas. 4:6)Fast as a serpent in the cover of the night
You never see them until they strike
Then they disappear into the dark
Never leaves a trail except the fright

See the legions of the ancient dragon, march away to kill
Many people will die tonight, without knowing why

Nothing can stop the ninja might
Someone must pay for the death of the dragon
They won't give up until your blood is spilled
Never surrender, nor retreat, NINJA MIGHT

For many years they have seeked for revenge
Now is the time to rise and conquer
The children of the night will rule again
Eternal darkness fills the air

March again, you have served me well
I need no more blood, the dragon lives againFem ist Fruhlings Hoffnungshauch

Wenn verwelkte Blaetter fallen
Sie langsam still zu Boden gleiten
Erfuellt mich Schmerz und leise Freunde
Wie ein Hauch aus Ewigkeiten

Wenn mein Herz zu bersten scheint
Wenn ich stille Traenen weine
Die im Regen ungeseh'n
Wenn Schoenheit nicht nur Bitterkeit,
Wenn Schweigen nicht nur Reue ist
Und Herbststuerme mich umweh'n

Dann trage ich ein Lied in mir
Das zeitenalt die Welt umspannt
Dann schwebt ein Traum auf meinem Pfade
Und nimmt mich sanft an kalter Hand

Ich bin des Herbstes Schweigestille
Ich bin des Regens Perlkristall
Ich bin des Waldes Wisperwind
Ich bin der gold'ne Sonnenfall

Und schwindet der Moment in mir
Entgleitet schmerzhaft meinem Blick
Da fluestert tief in mir mein Traum
"Bald kehre ich zu Dir zurueck:

Und laesst mir in den klammen Haenden

has been pushed to the edge
where beauty is being exploited
without the sense or respect.
Billions are doing theirs, never expecting the things
that would manifest themselves in a time to come.

With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
the colors fade away as black replaces all.
With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
images fade away as death replaces all.

Put the shadow in its place
as it supposed to appear.
The black shades are here beside us
as reflections of ours
when there is a light against
the antithesis of man-made knowledge.

From the void that comes through our optimisms,
we've learned to deny the potential excess,
where "why" is taboo and "how" is hyped.
Drifting from our very own pitiful existence,
minds that create an illusion of accomplishment.
Back from the tombs, the tragedy defines itself,
leading the ways to nowhere, where death is at the end!

With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
the colors fade away as black replaces all.
With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
images fade away as death replaces all.

A dismal portrait of mortal life,
betrayal of mankind's existence.
So many blind ambitions
with false motivations and false directions.
Caught in a cold confusion,
bearing all the lies of men.
I wish I could see my future life,
to look behind all these seemingly closed doors.
Illuminate me with true divine light,
O owner of the key to the world beyond...Aggresion is what I am - my hatred
Cruelty is inside of me - my duty
Curse is the reason of your endless anguish
My justice is what let me to pass the sentence

Hypocrisy is what you are - my victim
Mayhem is waht you are - my creation
I am who you know - vexation
I am who you know - persecutor

Alone in empty room, living out of fear
Persevering to the end, left hand's magic raises
Closed my own eyes, body's gravestone cold
Hate flows from my heart, bloodlust

Sitting in the Pentagram, Christ's might is nothing
now
In my brain infernal names, damned mind catches spells
Rivers of my deathly pain reach, attain everyone
Loosing souls die in torment, I take revenge

All my wrath I celebrate holding sepulchral composure
Occult power attacks and conquers, crushed victims
agonize
Rotting fleshes cover Earth, hordes rise with arms
Infernal priests are ready to fight, the massacre will
soon begin

And it's my power exploding with my ruthlessly
thrashing doom

Aimless struggles of exorcists, might of spell takes
life
Masterpiece of destruction triumphs, the agony of pain
rends brain
Death is salvation for flesh and blood but final
torment awaits there
And demons surround the corpse, lurking with lust for
soul

And it's my power exploding with my ruthlessly
thrashing doomAstral Conversions, spiritual modes
Invalid termination of a tyrant yoke
Parasites of innocence, the accident of god,
the plague of suffering reminds the coming of the fall...

Depraved emotions, a sanctum place.
Zodiac circle, the signs of Hell.
The law of heritage on a chimera based,
labyrinth of genesis division's parade.

Electric perversion for a human being
perpetual motion like an infinite sin.
A schism of holiness, the science of will,
crossing the universe with nails and dreams

Religious archetype, the parody of a mass
the void solution like a God with mask
Artificial silence, a never ending faith 
the roots of abhorrence command the instinct of hate...

Insulting the virtues of a sun with an endless light
Between... between the ruins of the mind
Defecting to the esoteric isolation like an eye
You are incited to betray...

Possessed by visions, an ultrasonic end
Chemical systems... of the broken DNA
a soul with chains
the egg of knowledge

Depraved the spirit of those who keep the flames
Behold the eruption of the cosmic seer

A vortex of renewal - A whirlpool of soulsThe knot of the braid 
The caves and meadows of the flesh 
The hopelessness at the heart of lust 
Grief like the growing vine 
My hopes in you have made me sick 
Heron stillness in summer water 
Lopped logs rotting in the moss 
Altars without offerings 
Gardens sown with dust(Instrumental)Did you ever experience this?
Recognize yourself
It could be a dream
More than real
State of consternation
Consciousness disorder
Painfull feeling of the blame
Fear of something undetermined
You don't defend yourself
You're not able
It's just like a wish of delivery
From the stone inside
But don't be worried
It won't take much time
You will be thinking I survived the hell
But it's just the only one
Of state of consciousness
But not the only one
Think about it!Intro: 

When you hear the calling of your clan and join with the spirit of the land 
Embrace your Folk and celebrate and honor; 
All of those who walked in years gone past and those with you who will stand fast 
With the lives of our future sons and daughters 

Verse: 

A common son, united by the past 
Product of our forefathers, our mothers, our kindred 
Seen through their eyes, 
The Folk Spirit carries on, enduring through our lives, 
The essence of our ancestry survives 

Chorus: 

And we live on, through the ages evermore 
A culture immortalized, carved into history 
Our deeds will live forever 
A common son, with roots ten thousand strong 
Orlog materialized, cast into destiny 
Go forth and bring glory 

Repeat intro 

We drink to you! 

Verse 2: 

We are reborn, from our ancestral line 
Reincarnation draught from the well of time 
Ever again, until the last light fades 
Into eternity, returning to the forge from whence we came 

Repeat Chorus 

And make us proud (you'll make us proud) 
This is our time, our place is now 
Go with blessings 
There is your future, live life with pride 
Go with blessings 
And make us proud 
This is your time, 
You'll make us proud.The mass! The mass!
The mass! The mass!(Instrumental)My eyes feel blind -  can't feel no more
My eyes feel blind - hopeless dead mind

My fear is my strength

Safe in my fear - can't feel no more
I stand alone -  weakness my strengthLife in our solar system

Lives of great men all remind us
We may make our lives sublime
And departing leave behind us
Footprints in the sands of time

Of hewn stones the sacred circle
Where the wizened sages sat
Let us try to remember
All the times where they were at

So your thoughts, they were expecting
Assault and battery on the human anatomy,
Assault and battery on the human anatomy, manAcross the hills they come 
Bags full of samples of floor 
It's impossible to run 
As they hold you at your door 

(You decline) 
His sales advances 
(He says fine) 
But he continues talking 

And so you're offered a whole floor free 
But the offer is too good to believe 
Perhaps you might like his carpet solutions 
The man supplies global floor revolution 

(Doormat instead) 
You've got five 
(Comes in red) 
You need no more 
(You decline) 
His sales advances 
(He says fine) 
But he continues talking 
(Then insists) 
It's getting annoying 
(Grabs your wrists) 
Is he allowed to do that 
(And persists) 
Please let me explain myself 

I want to sell you carpets 
I thought that's what you wanted 
I offer quality carpets 
At the lowest rate around 
Don't throw away my carpets 
I need to feed my children 
And they are sick of carpets 
They eat them everyday 

Would you prefer a shag rug? 
There is no giving up 
He is a marketing thug 
But he's drinking from the death cup 

(Leave the door) 
Go to the kitchen 
(Bitter, sore) 
Different mindset 

Had enough of this man's stupid games 
And the inner beast is no longer contained 
Hide the meat-cutter behind your back 
And grab the biggest bin-liner or sack 

(Oh you're back) 
Welcoming smile 
(What is that?) 
Produce it now 
(Spare my life) 
Press it against him 
(Think of my wife) 
He doesn't have one 
(Ouch that hurts) 
Turn it on 
(Blood does spurt) 
Finish the job 
(On your shirt) 
And so the deed is done 

I want to sell you carpets 
I thought that's what you wanted 
I offer quality carpets 
At the lowest rate around 
Don't throw away my carpets 
I need to feed my children 
And they are sick of carpets 
They eat them everyday 

What's this a knock at the door? 
Another thinks he has what it takes 
A salesman with a book of floors 
Go and fetch the sharpened stake 
By August twenty have gone 
No longer a carpet craze 
But what you have not yet won 
Sellers rise up from their graves 

And I want to sell you carpets 
I thought that's what you wanted 
I offer quality carpets 
At the lowest rate around 
Don't throw away my carpets 
I need to feed my children 
And they are sick of carpets 
They eat them everydayCome to me
Children of Mother Earth
Worshippers of the gods
I have for you
Your redemption

Run- the gods are not with us now
Run- for our powers are useless
Call for a saviour
Realise the voices in the void

What are these things?
Will not our god save us?
We called and they came
And you were forever silent
Why?

Run - your god is not with you now
Run - your powers are useless
Call for a saviour
Realise the voices in the void(Instrumental)Last night he came to me said
"I got something for you that's can set you free"
He handed me a pocket full of hopes and dreams
And in the middle of the night I woke up screaming!

Beware of the Candyman 25 reasons to pretend
You meant to be a friend, but destroys you in the end
I say no no no - no no no - it's the same old story baby

Last night he came to me "Wanna get rid of your EX G.F.?
So listen to me, in front of the mirror call thrice my name
I said "Candyman, candyman, c-c-c-c-candyman"

Beware of the Candyman 25 reasons to pretend
You meant to be a friend, but destroys you in the end
I say no no no - no no no - it's the same old story baby

Beware of the Candyman into the fire, out of the frying pan
There's nothing good to see under that white dress filled with misery
The road to hell is always paved with good intentions
So be the smart one and forget about the Candyman
 
Solo

Last night he came to "Lonely me"
Said "You will meet a girl bro' just wait and see"
The doorbell rang and two cheeks over my bed
After that hot night I was surely deeper in debt

Beware of the Candyman 25 reasons to pretend
You meant to be a friend, but destroys you in the end
I say no no no - no no no - it's the same old story baby

Beware of the Candyman into the fire, out of the frying pan
There's nothing good to see under that white dress filled with misery
The road to hell is always paved with good intentions
So be the smart one and forget about the CandymanI gather parts from the dark river
Like the old mother in the old story
The feet, the liver and even the smallest toes
I must gather them all
This is the secret task in the secret plan
I must darn the stitches right
The words are my needles
I enclose the horror and the fright
Dried are the veins and dried are the tears
The dark water has run back to its source
Spit and sand I use to make a whole
Now nothing fails and nothing falls
I inhale the sky and the virgin stars
Everything that is and could have been
All the paths and all the ends
Every leaf from these two trees
I give the soul to the body
The soul to the body and hear the gasp
I give the soul to the body
The soul to the body and feel the graspListen closely when mountains speak
And skies turn gray like elders
Thera quakes to clear her slate
We will itch her skin longer

Our island spits in disgust, not enough ships for us
If only we had gills, we may have escaped

Thera will be felt still thousands of years from now
We have her ash in our pores still to this day

Flocks of fire nested upon these homes
Like the hooks we bait, Akrotiri was swallowed

Millennia have passed and we still trip over her ash

Thera will be felt still thousands of years from now
We have her ash in our pores still to this dayPotter's Bluff, the town of death
Smell of decomposing flesh
Townspeople are living dead
Chopping, hacking you to death
Friendly people have you met
Are they real or are they dead?
Enter, you will meet your end
Boulder smashes in your head
Beaten, tied and burned alive
Needle stuck into your eye
Mortician bringing new life
Thoughts of a demented mind
Now you learn that you have died
Horrified, you're still alive(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The sun, so far away
Casts such a luminance
Enveloping all in its path
Casting shadows
And fading into dusk

Over the horizon it falls
And the sun casts a shadow
A note fills the air
Vibration sets innocent tone

Asylum from the tremors of the sun
As the moon blooms in the ebon sky
Embracing the sea of a raven universe
And stars fill the sky like silver sand

the tide of substance ebbing and flowing
Spines from the core of a furious force
Evolving never ceasing like vines in time
Reaching for the failure of our future

Shifting of matter, to chaos and disorder
Forming of life and existence, absorb and split
Swirling around the sun of all things
I have seen the harmony of havoc
I have felt the mortal push of existence

Gather in the storms of the universe
Let the course sharpen its destination
An absolute infinity of shapeless manifest
Falling upon the leaves of absolute mortality

A melting of frequencies
Betray our reality
Lending us fantasy
To the endless horizon

An era of spatial fragmentation
Melting and dividing creation
Relation of ruminant diversion
Architectural definition of solemnity
Expressed visions of burdens we bare...The agitation does
Not let me sleep
A constantly ticking clock
Deep inside of me

Everlasting thrust of thoughts
Eternal search for more

I can not stop
It moves in me
And lace my throat
I can't be free

I am a driven one
Always on hunt
And it grows steadily
By my own hand

Restless - everything flows
Restless - and my fear grows

Tinnitus torments me
I hate him fervently

I am a driven one
Always on hunt
And it grows steadily
By my own hand

Restless - i lose my mind
Unrest is all i find
Wooohhhhaaa

Restless - i lose my mind
Unrest is all I find(Eklundh)

Everyone looks at her
She only looks at me
The waiter introduces us to each other
This woman's a delicacy

My eyes lick her body
She smells oh so nice
I wanna eat her all up
A taste of paradise

Appetize, Appetize,
Appetize, Appetizer

I am a simple man
And I've got simple needs
I'm starving to see what she's hiding inside
Hungry for her dirty deeds 

A one way conversation
Her eyes say it all
We both know what we want tonight
I feel my stomach call

Appetize, Appetize,
Appetize, Appetizermy existence precedes the origin of the universe
I, deliverer of god. organizer of solar systems.
heaven is lasting. earth is enduring.
i am forever and you are of me.A cascade of lightning startles the firmament
A thousand black hooves clatter
Upon the mountain

Grey plume of dust
Red flag of blood
Blue shining blade of sky

Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword

Fresh skulls and supple bones
Golden helm of radiance

The incantation uttered by no one
The call to arms from nowhere

The message from the clarion
Resounded across deaf hills
Men awoke
And sprayed their blood upon the earth

Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword
Unseeing eye
Blood mixed with bloodDeath is now the new immortality and at last for the suffering 
I cannot refute the prophecy and forlorn, the decadent knowledge 
Such as life the true formation was equated not by hands 
But the entrails of the universe transcend this intangible disease 

Contrived, in shallow waters I will not confide 
The lies of visual creation, I am conforming to dark energy 
I piece together into air, I am mutating as a petrify, 
So uncommunicative I surmise 
Without the valor I will vanish by the ultimate elements serene 

Losing composure, my functions chromatic 
Prolific, like nerve endings here we will flourish 
Don't be discouraged by the abundance of man 
In mortal attendance we glide by like pockets of rain 

Desperation phase as the mass seduction plays 
The absence of floral condition has left me preserved 

The morning senses inter-playing have delayed their questioning 
The answers wry like autumn are pleading me into the void 
The echo of the growing noise turning into grain 

And spanned the journey, the substitution far expelled 
The absolute finale of the odyssey 
And the reminder, clustering the sullen matter 
The empty trail of ultimate relisation 

Contrived, in shallow waters I will not confide 
The lies of visual creation, I am conforming to dark energy 
I piece together into air, I am mutating as a petrify, 
So uncommunicative I surmise 
Without the valor I will vanish by the ultimate elements sereneI'm losing you
This is an ill dream
Invisible so

Gone
I chose for You
A lonesome place
So quiet
and beautiful
A lonesome place

I've lost you, gone
You died lonely
I killed you
Silently

You died in a dream
Lost paradise for you
This is my vengeance
For your faith in God

I killed so suddenly

The funeral for you
Without witnesses and ceremony
In green paradise
You were so naked
The funeral for you
Without hope or a priest
In green paradise
You were so beautiful

I am the way for youTHE FLOOD:

I am the one who holds the key

To the floodgates, to true power

The seas will roar at my command

Waves will ebb and flow when I say

The waters will come, the waters will rise

With great anger they will destroy

Purging this earth, cleansing mankind

My creation will start anew


I am king of the flood


No one among you still is righteous

You have all turned your backs on me

I made you from the earth you walk

But you betrayed me with your sin

My tears, as rain, will wipe you out

I guarantee a painful death

You won't forget my name again

Remember me when you can't breathe


Behold my flood


I am king of the flood(Instrumental)Have you ever been afraid of the world and what it can do to you
Looking out through hardened eyes
At a world that hates you
So you realize you're starting to hate it too

The stress is so thick you're ready to snap
At least you're still sane enough to see it, see it coming
And you say to yourself
Somebody please help me crawl out from under the volcano

It feels like my heart is dying inside if you could just hold it,
in your hands you would see how it's leaving me
As the loneliness sets in I desesperately cling to anyone's touch

It seems like it keeps on raining when the sun's on full
All alone it's desperation I hope my friends can forgime me
I'm desesperately hoping for someone
To pull me out from under the volcano
Under the volcanoAll those letters of yours make me feel less lonely.
You've simply got to believe you're my one and only.
My puppy eyes will make you take the bait.
If you love me true we'll help set things straight.

Be, be my, be my mur, be my murder, be my murder grew, be my murder groupie. (x2)
Be my murder groupie. (x2)

Your support and affection mean the world to me.
But I need your trust desperately.
That shallow life of yours could stand a thrill.
If you love me then precious, kill you will.

(Be mine)
You want a change; you're feeling stuck. 
An easy prey; a sitting duck.
Your existence is healing.
I'll read you like an open book.
If you love me then precious, kill you will!

Be, be my, be my mur, be my murder, be my murder grew, be my murder groupie. (x2)
Be my murder groupie. (x2)

You want a change; you're feeling stuck.

Be, be my, be my mur, be my murder, be my murder grew, be my murder groupie. (x4)
Be my murder groupie! (x2)I want to touch your skin
kiss your lips still with the taste of wine
I need all your movements
hear your breath please free our minds
Crazy angel shake for me tonight till the morning lights
Naked, close to me... now nothing to surround us

Send me to heaven and then take me down to hell

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me
We are lost inside of pleasure

I got sinful desires, baby I can take you higher
Now look at my face, every moment, every place
We can do everything, we can do it in every way
Baby please don't stop these hands

Send me to heaven and then take me down to hell

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me
We are lost inside of pleasure

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me
We are lost inside of pleasure(Instrumental)I cannot remember what it was that came before
All I know is that I'm alone (within each fragment of every thinking body)
Subjective pieces of a collective unconscious
Which have been dispersed upon reflection
Each remnant in solitude trying to find their way back home
Shaping their own images
Before the night conceived the stars
Before the dawn
Before the eyes deceived us all
A place I no longer recall
I must have been sleepwalking
Through my nightmares
In which I caught a glimpse
Of my own self reflection
Becoming aware of my own futility
Is this real
Nothing
Or just something 
Is real
I've been longing
To feel
I tried to create
In order to understand
And now that I know
I have become
More incompleteWhile everything stood still 
The army of beasts 
Rose to the Earth 
Seized the control 

Humans were taken as hostages 
Prisoned into camps 
Fed with 
Mutated mice 

Then The leader of the cats 
Raising its paw 
Gave the order 
Worse than 66th 

They rip our eyes 
Tear chests open, Stab our hearts 
Laughing at our faces 
As we scream in agony 

So in ruins around us 
Lies our ideals, crushed to the ground 
In desperate search for guidance 
Forgot that we should be the ones in control 

A horrifying sight to behold 
Intestines everywhere 
Limbs slowly devoured by kittens 
A Beautiful bloodbath symphony 

In a moment of silence 
They stop to admire their creation 
A brand new world 
Long awaited Catopia 

They rip our eyes 
Tear chests open, Stab our hearts 
Laughing at our faces 
As we scream in agony 

The final words of mankind 
Echo through the night 
It's so fluffy 
So fluffy I'm going to dieThe dawn glimmers upon 
an egg that was 
better off stillborn, dormant in unconsciousness 
The shell reluctantly cracks, the calcium carbonate shards 
consumed by the mother for nourishment 

Enter this existence 
Fall in line with the primal cadence 
Or expect any and all resistance 

All-knowing in ignorance 
Infancy and its incidents 
Forcing you to learn 
Blow by blow 

Figures segue 
on and off your path 
Many die before you 
as you will before their offspring 
but for now 
you trudge onward 

Into heartbreak, corporate slavery, atrophy, dementia, 
ostracization and other foul plagues 
that only consciousness can bring 
Out of the shroud that shielded 
your egg from the dawn 

We know not why your soul was brought into suffering 
We know not why your soul was brought into suffering 

Oftentimes we are brought into circumstances that we are not meant to understand 
We are meant only to find pleasure and peace in the world with the time we are given 
In the place that we find ourselves 

Your joints rebel through arthritis 
Your organs taking on the weight of decades 
a leprous form emerging 
your body protesting against a life 
you were too foolish to end 

Exit this existence 
No reward for persistence 
All reason fades into the distanceYour air becomes my water
Your water becomes my air
Your scream becomes your last one
Now listen to me and bare - yourself

This prison cell of loneliness
Is just a drop in my ocean of grief
The true vacuum is in me
In my half-heart and need - for you

My forehead against yours
The bridge between our thoughts
All entangled in you and me
Like triangles in harmony

Meditation for ages
Meditation through seasons
Learning, understanding
Until the ice breaks like thunder!

Mirrors are smashed into pieces
Reality seen through a kaleidoscope
We rise over this chaos as one
We pass the sentence and give the hopeBury the hatchet, put you differences aside
We don't care who picked the initial fight

The music of today ain't worth a damn
Please, won't you reunite?

Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback

We're desperate to buy overpriced tickets
For yet another farewell tour

Nostalgia was so much better before...

Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback

Your legenday look and your trademark pose
Used to be sublime

Dye your streaks of grey, burn that fat away
Let's pretend you're in your prime

Another compilation with the same old tunes
Remastered for the zillionth time

Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
Come back! Come back! Come back to comebackMoonlight - Driving nowhere fast
A cigarette, I watch the rain

Strange town - But everything
seems strange
Since all desire left my skin

Reject and fight back your
Fears
Reject all the sickness and
Puke your hate

Howling under the light
Is there any life tonight?

Rejections - New wounds
Of my fractured mind
Even the skies seem to abandon me

4:00 A.M. - And those white lights
Making me blind
I'm absorbed in a whirl somewhere
Deep in me

Why can't I see before me

So far away from me
So far away ' Away from you(Instrumental)(Instrumental)VERSE 1
In this dark, unending gloom,
the end feels so close, no matter how much time's left.
Having hope just makes you weaker,
and leads you to your doom.

Just sorrow and cries,
you can't deny
how much we bleed
how much we fight.

Cold-hearted words, soul-torturing wrongs
you're tired. Just let me free and we'll make 'em pay.

BRIDGE 1
Time for you to go,
won't let you back in-NO
I'm heading up, rising out of the shadows
I'll fight until I find
a way to get what I desire.

VERSE 2
You preach about darkness, death and hate but
you can't renounce to
all in the world that's good:
compassion, freedom, kindness
still mean a lot to you.

A frightened soul in need of mending,
that's what you are, that's what I am.

I'm breaking free, won't let you win this fight...
I'll take you back to the light.

BRIDGE 2
Time for you to go,
won't let you back in-NO
I'm heading up, rising out of the shadows
I'll fight until I find
a different way,
to make things right.

CHORUS
Will you bend
and gladly sacrifice your feelings
or embrace
a light that always shines?

Can you live
humanity and chaos together
and accept
your two conflicting selves?

To listen to reason,
or to follow your feelings?
That is the question
and you are the answer.

Yeah, you are the answer.

BRIDGE 3
Time for you to go,
won't let you back in-NO
I'm heading up, rising out of the shadows
I'll fight until I find
a way to make you
see what's right.Nazorite,lost messiah
Rabbi man from Galilee
You raised the dead or so they say
Did you want to be a god for a third world cause ?

Don't make any mistakes
I didn't come here to bring peace,
I came to bring a sword
Do you think God only belongs to you ?
He doesn't
God is an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody.
God is not an Israelite.

Crucified lost messiah
Priest king & Sicari
You opened your eyes but faith is blind
Did you want a cure for a fucked up world ?

Don't make any mistakes
I didn't come here to bring peace,
I came to bring a sword,
Do you think God only belongs to you ?
He doesn't
God is an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody
God is not an Israelite.

Believe in me,you fucking scum
Kneel before my name,
I am the Son of God
Kill for me & live forever by my side.
Or burn in fucking Hell.

Wanderer,prophet man
Killed by fear in a conquered land
Crowned with thorns & nailed up high
Did you want to be a star in a sky full of shit ?

I am the God of blasphemy.ESCAPE OR DIE

THIS WARRIOR OF SILENCE, ABOUT TO CONSUME
ESCAPE...OR DIE!Walking in the dust, cold fire. 
Crossing the body, leaving the memories.
Crystallized waters run towards a blue sky.
The sun it stops seeing the birth of a new flame. 
Voices that spoke in a childhood dream.

For  years I have wandered. 
Under the wings of the desperation, 
Hoping that everything finishes. 
And to rebirth again from the corruption. My sacrifice.

The sun returns so far, burning itself. 
Fire figures, It dance for my sacrifice.

I will change the way of existence, I will break the chains. 
My last breath. Not able to see others, without your eyes.

Where it is my ascension. For see you to burn? 
Where the lies are laws. Purity or pain? 
Where all the beautiful must die. For leave you back.

As God returns. To regain me faith. 
Suffering, my apocalypse. Underneath ash I walk.
My Sacrifice, My Death, My Rebirth.(Instrumental)Isle of the Dead, towering cyprus trees,
Christ-like figure in white, stand in your boat
and cast your mood upon me.
I might have known.
This holy gown of stars, hung for miles, from my Father's halls...
...Now I Am.In between the corridors
Of this big prison
Many corpses lay
Full of infection
Infection of life
Nothing can help them
Their only escape is to die

No, I can't help
You can't escape from here
No I can't help
Nobody will run away

The sins of the world
Are on your hands
Living holy peace
Is just an illusion
It will follow you until te end
"This fucking punishment(Instrumental)Everyday we do many things, where we either don't know or care about the outcome.
In either case their results are unpredictable in different degrees.
The unpredictability factor is the devil, it is death and it is within everything in varying degrees.
Think almost all things you do bearing in mind your expectations and the results. Think...
Working with death is just like working with anything else, you work with the unpredictable.(Instrumental)Barely perceived through somnambulity 
Kinetic vacuum distorts observance 
Air tight cages of the multiplex 
Deadening empty happiness 

Insecurity conditioning disguised 
As the usual advertising 
Dazed eyes wander casually 

Spatial atrophy 
Memory dump file 
Dazed rambling in synchronicity 

Barely perceived through somnambulity 
Kinetic vacuum distorts observance 
Air tight cages of the multiplex 
Deadening empty happinessHidden chamber beneath the Earth 
Built with stone and very dark 
Hiding lost atomic arms 
From a war never fought 
Malicious schemes, the Devil's own 
Weapons under his control 
Overlord splits the ground, aiming for the sky 
A strike for the holy one, now it's time to die 

Nuke the Cross 

Wall of fire glowing bright 
Lightning cracks across the sky 
Warheads boiling to extremes 
Religion is now history 
Pit fiend in the hellish planes 
Master of his domain 
Sounds of the angels crying 
heard throughout the night 
A strike for the holy on now it's time to die 

Nuke the cross 

Your savior can't retaliate 
Can't fight against this storm of hate 
Brought on by years of lies 
Cast right out from the skies 
Using stockpiles made by man 
Stronger than we can grasp 

Missiles launched, encased in black 
aiming for the sky 
God can't defend this strike 
Now's his time to die 

Nuke the cross(Instrumental)Run, and never come back. The hour is upon you. Never come back. The measure of your failures is the sum of what you are. Where will you fly, child? Far beyond my reach? How will you fly, child, so fast and so far that you might outpace the sun? Who in his right mind would go on with this pathetic labor, long after hope and beauty are gone? You've lost everything. Go, break your back. Grind your face in the dirt. You asked and you'll receive. Here is watered wine, given to you in scorn. Swallow it down until you choke, and die in a corner, a martyr without a god. Who in his right mind would go on with this pathetic labor, after everything? Come, come, surrender to the weakness of the moment. Bow down and become empty. I'll give you all you need, and take everything you are. Raise your head up high. Close your searching eyes, and open your mouth wide. You're nothing but a slave. Who in his right mind would cast off his every dream to go on with this pathetic labor, after everything?Bay Area baseball rules
Kids will ditch schools
Play the game, it's fun
Hot dogs & Coke, the sun!
I shoot up smack under my nails
To get high and experience life
I am free and this is how I want
To live, it is good for youYou say-there is god in me
You shout-in the name of god
You say we have to live in humility
And fight in the name of good
You ask-make a gift of your
Dirty hands
Your soul is empty
Your tongue is dirty, too
You shout making noise
Priest, of holy church!
You don't know our consciences
You use our harms
You are surrounded by crowd of foo
Money is your aim
Your pride is boundless
The priest of rust
You are absorbed in human nanety
You take our pains
You take our time
You time has collapsed
You ideas have died
You are loosing your power
You time is finished!!!You're dead, vert vamp 
Slam the floor like a fucking tramp 
Bite that neck, watch it bleed 
Life so horrid and filled with greed 
Take your life, seal your fate 
Pulse racing sporadic heart rate 
Sucking blood, and none is wasted 
Check your fucking head 

Cause he hasn't seen the light of day 
For a thousand years 
Sitting on his couch 
Slamming loads of beers 
When it comes to night time 
When it's nice and dark 
Searching for a victim 
In his local park 

Going down to surfer camp 
To see what he can do 
Vert vamp is here 
He's coming after you 
He's gonna rip it up 
He's calling out your name 
He's gonna make you wish like you never fucking came 

Gonna Rip It Up 

Hyped up on plasma 
No time for hesitating 
Time to drop in and get fucking wasting 
Wearing corpse paint 
The black metal lord 
All will die who live by the board 

Falses hanging out 
They haven't got a clue 
If the vamp catches you I wonder what he'll do 
He'll bite out your neck 
He'll rip you apart 
He'll Show you the remains of your still beating heart 

Gonna Rip It Up

VI. BLOOD AND GUTS 

Deep in the bowels of an edifice, foul 
The wretched dregs of the ghetto corralled 
Covert experiments mutating forms 
And violating every ethical norm 

I, Dr. Zongo, master of my trade 
Employing Super Science to make an army of slaves 
You will be servile, and you will obey 
You will sit and you will stay! 

Ragged wounds leaking virulent pus 
Stapled flesh where the guillotine cut 

Tubes pulse with chemical brews 
Cervical vertebrae are grotesquely fused 
On the slab, a chimerical mutt 
A concatenation of Blood & Guts 

Bow to the whip hand, and bow to the fist 
The feral creations were deservedly pissed 
The doctor screamed as their manacles snapped 
Dragged off to his doom as his skivvies were crapped 

Deep in the bowels of an edifice, foul 
A wretched freak is emitting a howl 

On the slab, a chimerical mutt 
A concatenation of Blood & Guts 
On the slab you are nothing but 
A concatenation of Blood & Guts 
On the slab, a chimerical mutt 
A concatenation of Blood & Guts 
On the slab you are nothing but 
A concatenation of Blood & GutsDon't say you have left me
Don't say it's true
Don't say that I am without you
I guess I'm going
I'm going astray
You were the one that got away
But I say

I just can't believe it's true
That I am here without you
I hear you calling out my name
But I keep going on

Don't say you have left me
Don't say it's true
There is no life here without you
But I kept on going
Going astray
And I beg for that final day
But I say

I just can't believe it's true
That I am here without you
I hear you calling out my name
But I keep going on

They tell me it's for you
They tell me that I'll pull through
But I won't beg 'cause I know you're gone
Gone, gone, gone...

I just can't believe it's true
That I am here without you
I hear you calling out my name
But I keep going onThe last dawn just shone
But you know that nothing's ever cast in stone
Men may cry and die
But till the end we're here to always try

we must pay our price
Until we know our future is bright

Perpetual fire
Burning desire

Sinking down so low
While our sun goes up and melts the icy snow
We must stay to fight
Till the flame of life is shining through the sky

Pain and sadness stress our soul
But this cold wind will stop to blowObscurity of the night broken by a light

Sun and moon banned in all eternity

Holy pagan hail to you!

Bantahlah segala-galanya yang bermuka Islamiah,
Bantahlah segala-galanya yang jahil demi Aku.(Instrumental)See the horned creature
Looking back from the mirror pool
Bloodstains and feces
Defile the fountain of innocence

And you drink with passion
Lust beyond your control
Still the fever is rising
Down with it you go

There behind black trees
The drunken puppets dance
And the devil runs towards you
You look him in the eye

He is smiling and takes you by the hand

The ceremony is proceeding
Reaching its final words
The virgins are so cold
And your dervishes whirl too fastMy impure soul 
Seeking the words 
From the Lord of the Darkness 

My meat it feeds 
From the bath in the sacrifice's rise 
Of the fire's flame 

Black moon 
The eternal cold night 
I hear the Cerberus howl 
Guarding in the prison 
The next virgin(Instrumental)Trapped in purgatory 
A lifeless object, alive 
Awaiting reprisal 
Death will be their acquisition 

The sky is turning red 
Return to power draws near 
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears 
Abolish the rules made of stone 

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past 
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above 

Awaiting the hour of reprisal 
Your time slips away 

Raining blood 
From a lacerated sky 
Bleeding its horror 
Creating my structure 
Now I shall reign in blood!Straight ahead a lady waits, with evil she pretend 
 Elimination, dark reaction, ways of fear I spend 
 Storm and water, endless scatter, smoke upon my grave 
 I try the best of my pretext, clouds of dark....no rest !!!! 

 Spreading all her misery 
 Evil 
 Spreading all my best 

 Take me, hate me 
 Hear me crying, save me 
 Fear me, pray me 
 Come to me, kill me 

 Spreading all her misery 
 Spreading all my best 

 The brilliance of the moon on me 
 Bring me fire, bring me pain 
 Elimination, dark reaction 
 Take me, hate me, come to fear me 
 I try the best of my pretext, clouds of dark....no rest !!!! 
 With evil I will cry 
 With evil I will die 

 Several superposed meaning guaranteed the experience besides the confusion 

 So within my ignorance I even had a different idea from which I tried like certain, and closer it was of this and so far from the tried one by God(Instrumental)The silence calls my name
The cold comes back to stay
And nothing seems to move
But my weak senses
The light starts to hide
My body paralyzed
My shadow disappears
I know It's the time

I thought I was aware of my own feelings
I cannot even trust my mind
No matter what I see and what I think of
It's haunting me deep down inside

Close my eyes into the darkness
Sense the felling it will drag you down
Hiding from this daznig silence
Whispering to me beneath my skin

I'm bleeding myself dry
And never get too far
Defenseless to the thoghts
Beyond deception
My throat is geeting dry
My sweet is dyed black
Burning through my breath
Soaring to my eyes

I try to keep control of my delusions
Awakening from the passive hell
Surrounded by the frightening calm and stillness
I only want to break away

I close my eyes into the darkness
Sense the felling it is dragging me down
I'm hiding from this dazing silence
They're whispering to me beneath my skin

I close my eyes into the darkness
Sense the felling it is dragging me down
I'm hiding from this dazing silence
They're whispering to me beneath my skin

I close my eyes into the darkness
Sense the felling it is dragging me down
I'm hiding from this dazing silence
They're whispering to me beneath my skin(Instrumental)words swell during the process of relevant intoxication the mind desensitizes and becomes exceptionally insecure from its state of normalcy and everyday lifestyle trivial impressions consume the mind and eat away at the cowering intellect the aching brain inflates and braces the skull for tranquility but calmness is no longer an option for anxiety has consumed all notions aspiration has been slaughtered.LOST IN A LAND OF SAVAGERY

Turn away - You now have been told
Never to return, memories will last
In the future, you'll think about the past
Never to forget, what you have seen

People come to pay respect
Taking pictures of the dead
That is what life comes to be
Once they lived, now they're deceased

Death is oh so strange
The past no one can change
What you can't predict
Is how long you'll exist

Life will never be the same
Death can never be explained
It's their time to go beyond

They'll never be stopped
Masses of conflicts
We are always alone
The alliance of mankind
Will never withstand

Only when we make war
On each other no more
We have a chance to survive
Only then we can stay alive

If this continues
We will never be able to hold
The hands of our children
And no on of us will be old

Alone we stand
Our obstinacy will doom us
Each for his own land
Alone we stand

Only when we make war
On each other no more
We have a chance to survive
Only then we can stay alive(Instrumental)(Instrumental)There are a lot of colors out of here,
red and yellow upon the trees
green and brown on the soil,
it's cold but not too much;

The wind is placid at this time
while this loneliness pervades me,
and I found myself travelling
with the mind to unknown places
where the sun shines
and it looks like spring.

And now, awakened from the dream,
I found myself here
while winter is almost here.(Instrumental)Gouging, ripping, tearing from bone

Mastering eternity I found your bleeding head
From the room of ecstasy

Crawling deep into the story
Waiting of my awakening
Nothing seems to change the way of dream
You've planned, not to be served
For all feelings that die to unreal limits can't be alone
One of the lifes you tried to choose
Was not for sale, again you fail

The fanning of cedars made a breeze
The breeze blew from the turret
My senses all suspended

To come to the pleasure you have not
To come to the knowledge you have not
To come to the possession you have not
To come to the creation you have not

The lion shook its head and wondered
I heard the great cry of distress
Here is indeed the stone
I come to seduce your last sin

I've searched my soul
I've searched the world
At the summit my morning is not
At the summit my hour is not
Arise now
Arise now
Thou great noontide
Thou great madnessAn indescribable sadness hung over 
These shifting forms and structures. 
The hopelessness of passing time 
And the melancholy 
Of unalterable past events. 
Quiet over the hilltops now, 
Woodland birdsong ceased. 
Alone 
beneath the sky I stand again. 
Wait, weary one: 
Soon, like these, 
We may also cease."Vocals to start from now!"

Within our senseless will, driving motives
No absolution for one's desires
Changes are minor, yet impact is unaccountable
No standard for achieving satisfaction
Rising from the depths of needs
Voices that will take control
The dances of demons inside the brain
Post-modern struggle within a self

When the basics are covered, alternatives taken
Creatively made options, a new world chaos
Many to choose from, but more yet to offer
The world is not enough as sky is our limit
Rising from the depths of needs
Voices that will take control
The dances of demons inside the brain
Post-modern struggle within a self

Derived from disturbances, arrival of morbid signals
When insanity approaches,
the weak is the one who denies his weakness

No need to evaluate sin and its values
when it came to degenerate our existence
Accepting the power to wash over self
Transformation is imminent
Rising from the hollow core,
someone who must take control
Invite the flame to purge and burn
Ruling the battle within a selfOur eyes meet across from the pier, we share a stellar gaze.
And I already know that I am going to kill you.
Your clueless mind draws you closer to me and that devilish grin I'd recognize from anywhere. the moon has been bright for so long and I am becoming impatient.
Lets leave and get the fuck out of  here.
The end is near for you.
What do you drink?
I shall provide.
I have a pair of cinder block  shoes in just your size.
Just come over here, just be very still.
It's not going to hurt it's just a power drill.
Your sedation is key in suppressing your scream. 
Your seduction is key in splitting your seam. 
I watch the life pour out of you as I plant my spawn in your wounds.I can't take anymore of you - Get out of my head 
Got nothing left for you - and now I'm seeing red 
and I taste your demise - like a cold dish revenge 
I'm sick of all your lies - evil thoughts you send 
telling me this and showing me that, Like a moth to the flame 
but no more trickery 
it's the end of the game Now 

Believed every word you said - Like a Fool I took the bait 
Now eat every word you said - and feel it aggravate 
I count every time you sicken me - and realize 
You're not even capable of telling me - Anything but lies 

And you're spinning your webs and telling your lies 
You're thinking that I'm nothing without you 
I'm breaking you off, I'm cutting you off 
You're gonna see it's time to face the truth 
It's the end of the game - end of the game 
It's the end of the game - end of the game(Instrumental)stop crying you whiny bitch
I'll give you a reason to weep
a fucking warhammer up your cunt
this song is about killing emo kids
with hammersWherever we go, whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps
And our breath
Protecting and watching all...
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?

Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure

Sacred is the gift that they
Have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of time

Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack
Time that is short-distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?

Following all instincts that are pureYou believe but in what
You live but why
You exist. But now
Your life's flies.

My body breaks cracking
Misery its me up
There is no truth here
The wall life is a shame.

You hate because keeps you alive
Love is enough
There is no lock of evil.EYES WET AND SO ARE MINE
ANOTHER PAIN BUT OF DIFFERENT KIND
MAKE SURE NOT A DROP YOU WASTE
OF BLOOD OF PRECIOUS TASTE
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE PROVES NO TRUTH
WE'RE ENSLAVED BY A HUMAN BIAS TO HURT

YOU, THE PAIN CROWNS YOU WITH HOLINESS
BUT WHAT IS LEFT WE CALL MADNESS
YOU, IN THRALL OF YOUR OWN VANITY
WAR HATRED AND MISERY

KARMA TO BURN, FATE IS GROWING OLD
A LONG WAY, PAVEMENT IS NO GOLD
A DREADFUL ENDING JUST BY MISTAKE
TELL ME HOW MUCH PAIN CAN YOU TAKE?
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE PROVES NO TRUTH
WE'RE ENSLAVED BY A HUMAN BIAS TO HURT

EYES WET AND SO ARE MINE
ANOTHER PAIN BUT OF DIFFERENT KIND
A DREADFUL ENDING JUST BY MISTAKE
TELL ME HOW MUCH PAIN CAN YOU TAKE?

pump room brawl
degrading spectacle
under the Horn
down the hatch !In my existential emptiness
I feel a force, which goes deeply into me.

I see loneliness,
I see nobody,

Cold walls hinder my calm.
When the noise is loud it is better,
It turns me away from my thoughts.

Shadows I see passing are only illusions.
Torments lie in me,
Because I'm just a tired shadow...
...Too tired to live...
Later I'll walk with bowed head
Sunk in my images.

Shadows, shadows:
Walking in line making chaos.Forced being here you are
That have kept from the lake
Of endlessly pairing
No man can understand
Its real existence
From now on it is your
Guest till the end of your
Life

Just shimmer
Shimmer in me

Weak shallows are embracing your
soul what have been concealed
from the punishment of life
There is no solution to shirk
dying at the end
It is our due
It is our due

We all fear the darkness
Endlessly way and endlessly sorrow are the requitals
Can't you see that the
Life is not yours but its all fear is yours

You fit everything
into that kind of nothing
And then all of you
will be crumbling into dust

Shadows are ruling your dreams

Fear your fire that is ruling your life
See the dark covering your mind
Fuck your blood in your veins
And cover your tears with it

Forced being here you are
Which have kept from the lake
Of endlessly pairing
No man can understand
Its real existenceAnger, the feeling numbs me
hate reforms through me
deep down from my heart
rises eternal apathy

I wander! Through three forms of hell! Depression, loneliness and hate! (2x)

I deny your existence
I can see you but you're not there
you could have ended my misery
no, you let me suffer..

I wander! In the abyss of my mind! Searching for answers! (2x)

Why are you so hateful?
why are you so hateful?
can't you see you're killing me?
you're killing me inside
why are you so hateful?
why are you so hateful!
you wanted to know how I feel?
let me fucking tell you how I feel!!

I'm here inside
deep inside myself
you left me here
you left me to die
my shadow is now gone
and the echoes will leave
can I finally have my peace?
now can I finally...
DIE!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Spinning throught the void
Now tearing through the sky
And I'm meeting with the ground.
The hole he has carved,
Smoking ruin on ruinous sphere
Now cradle to his ancient form,
And his new birth.
He is enormous,
His fur is coarse,
His claws are long,
He is the giver of life.
His voyage begins
The voyage
He is Megatherium.
The head is raised,
Sniffing at stale air.
It is melting from within,
The sphere is imperfect.
Hands deep in the planet sensing what can be done.
Limitless potential.
Sweep of his great arm,
Mountains are raised,
The lay of the land is pulled
From the ground.
This will not do he thinks,
And he waters the world anew.
From grey to blue to green,
The rock is transformed.
But still so lonely.
He reaches into the dirt,
And pulls out the stones.
Stone turns to seed in his hand and he wanders his world alone with a new mission in mind. The sower who does not reap plants as he goes and people grow. He takes the world in his arms as he dies and protects his nubile planet, now safe from hostile space.
The seeds grow delicate and frail,
And the journey begins of Megatherian.They say it's the music
Music in the rain
All these kids are dying
Take their own lives
Take their own lives
Take their own lives

'Cause all the little boys and girls won't come out to play
And everyone's alone in the world 'cause they won't come out to play

God, Death & Audiotape
God, Death & Audiotape
God, Death & Audiotape

Just like a trip down Matamoros Way
There's a friendly place where you can stay
Or maybe to Jonestown for a friendly little drink
What do you think?
What do you think?

'Cause all the little boys and girls won't come out to play
And everyone's alone in the world 'cause they won't come out to play

God, Death & Audiotape
God, Death & Audiotape
God, Death & AudiotapeI sleep alone tonight
Before I wake I always see
That dream where everything is dark 
But I feel I`m tied with chains
It won`t let me go 
it won`t let me wake 
Before I`ve seen that scary thing
Which makes my life like misery

Walk through there`s a cradle where you`re crying
Laughing crowd with a sound too strange
I`ve seen it from everyside and everytime
I`m loosing that same
It could satisfied my hunger
Leave me be
I`ve gone with you

This waiting hour seems to last like pain
I feel inside
Every morning the same dream makes me 
Weak and suffer

Taste me 
You`ll see when it ends
Before there`s something to control me
Won`t resist you if you choose to do your own way
But the anger there`s left 
For longer there will be no rest
I'll drag you down with me

I`ve Gone With You
Somewhere-Nowhere-Someday

You`ve seen a poor child begging 
He became diposed to anger
So the world raised its hand against ignorent son
And the anger there`s left will never fade from this
head
I`ll drag you down with me

I`ve Gone With You
Somewhere-Nowhere-Somedayhiding behind a veil of shadows
circling the truth but never see
hiding behind a broken promise
all of this world is it just a dream ?
down down and down we go

descend from your throne !

the serpent crawls through all your words
into the hearts of man to crush their souls
to empty shells bow down before the crown

"into the interior: a vast subdivision, antennae of television to the meaningless sky.
in lifeproof houses they hover over the young, sop up a little of what they shut out.
only the young bring anything in, and they are not young very long..."
(w. burroughs, the naked lunch)

nature calls what can i do
leave this world or start anew
broken are my wings to fly
with shattered dreams i turn to die
the dust it weighs me down
pulls me down to the unknown...(Instrumental)Hala jiwa tak searah fikiran
Berontak melawan nalar fikiran
Aku mencoba keluar dari semua
Imajinasi tak bertuhan 

Kehidupan bukan dijiwa
Kehidupan bukan diraga
Kehidupan hanya fikiran
Imajinasi tak bertuhan

Aku ingin bebas dari semua
Pergi dari pikiranku yang gila
Pergi jauh dari semua yang ada
Dengarkanku engkau yang berkuasa

Tubuhku terluka dalam fikiran
Hentakan benda terasa di jiwa
Tersungkur darah tubuh penuh luka
Sterilisasi genetika gila
Saat kebiadaban dipertanyakan
Ku bunuh semua dengan keadilan
Tikam tepat sebuah kegelapan
Imajinasi tak bertuhan(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Bone Crusher
We talk of the dead - their moaning in the nights
We speak of their souls - decaying into beyond
We fucked the bastards - when feelings burdened their lives 
Now they rise again to rape us reversed
Bone crusher!
You that sleep in mud
Bone crusher!
Smell their unholy blood! 
Careless carcass
Soulless being
Nameless pervert
Cynic rapist
From the abyss of eternal affliction a compelling creature awakens - fresh from the dead
Spawned to kill, sent to murder on the marshes of humanity 
Hate them!
Prepare your grinder - for the final attack
Wait In anger - until mankind is exposed
Sharpen your blades - they shall slice them from all flesh
Damn, damn, damn them?.
Bone crusher!
You that sleep in the mud
Bone crusher!
Smell their unholy blood 
Laughing at your victims - as your crush them alive
Impaling their bodies - on sticks of flames and wire
Skinning their flesh - as pigs you slaughter them all
The rest you eat - and spitting out the teeth 
Bone crusher!
You that sleep in the mud
Bone crusher!
Smell their unholy blood 
Careless carcass
Soulless being
Nameless pervert
Cynic rapistYou're like a flower in the dirt
Your smile is full of light & warmth
When you go by birds sing their songs
And people's hearts are full of joy

Under the wheels of Time
Is a rhythm of my heartbeat
Heart is a red piece of meat
Life is only a torture,
A moment before death
No more hope, no more faith
No more rules. Tell me
What else can you wait for?
There's no love, there's no hate
That's all dream until death

Time is a cruel jocker
The moon confused body and mind
Astral world of my feelings
Calls to choose its dark side

Moonlight gets into my body
Cutting my skin like a blade
SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS CHANGING
With violent rate

No more lust, no more desire
No more rules. Tell me
What else can you wait for!
There's no love, there's no hate
That's all dream until death

DON'T GO SHAKING MAMA!

This is devil's kiss
Under the wheels of time

HELP ME PLEASE!O Lord of fire standing in the midst of the void; how I hate the smell of their mouth, their sweat, their fingers, all I will do is thy will...
Samael, bury my soul, you are fucking Lilith with Satan, proving that I am your son. Father Lucifer, bury my soul. Mother, die from cold, suffering through fatherless storms...
Anrita; my be-lowered son, I must kill you to open gates to void. Set fuck off. Typhon, I am born in the cave.
Constant Cancer(Keeper of the Gate)
A hollow universe of death rotting created by god as an evil curse
Where all life dies, death lives and nature breeds untellable fear
Beyond lake of freezing flame, avast burning caverns of sulphur
Unto immense fields of despair; ever purposeful Lucifer traversed
Where to upon reaching the gates of hell he encountered a form in the abyss
Of immense shape and strength this guardian of hell stood before him and commanded
with cerebrean howl "You shall not pass Lucifer, o' king of hell, lord of lies and deception.. I am decreed upon this gate as sentinel and no beast so foul as yourself may pass beyond me." 

"Thou art grim and terrible guardian,
tho magnificence mean to pass.. Retire or taste thy excess!"
"Thou art traitor angel! Whom first broke peace
in heaven.. Back to thy punishment fugitive!"
"Learn by proof then hellborn! Not to contend with spirits of heaven!"
"So raise your cleave heaven born and prepare thyself for horrors unfelt!"


O'er time and dimensions they raged and cleaved..
Amongst burning flares of disease and torture..
Upon the ashes of the spectacular dead embodied old..
With fell swoop of his impetuous hand thee mighty guardian receded 

"Into the shadows with you once more you fowl servant of god!
Lest I lay your head upon my chamber as reminder of your failure and betrayal."
"Vanish I may lord of flies and chaos, yet gloat not your victory upon mine ears lest I trade words with he most high upon his throne.. I shall diminish into the blackest depths of hell and await my persecution but not until I bestow my key upon your neck and bid you farewell... my lord."
"Farewell then Guardian and trust not to hope.. For it has abandoned ye." 

With impetuous recoil and jarring sound thee infernal doors on their hinges did swing wide and vast exposing space and time and dimension upon his eyes.. With wingspread vast for arms of soldiers in voluminous armies unnumbered Erebus had opened as outer gate.. 

(Binding the Centuries)
As duty he stepped forth unto the immense gates as without dimension, breadth, width and time were lost and elder nature holds chaos as anarchy. Where moist, dry, hot and cold held no place.. Upon the..
Seed of Zonei!
Torn asunder the body shreds unto pain and fire.. Gods of all to tear the flesh from bone to rent the blood of veins and crumble bone unto dust. With features unknown they revealed unto Satan a history of time and wars.. Of dark waters receding to reveal signs of Chaos.. Of immeasurable beasts and gods raging unto each one with fury unseen by even angels of death and wrath.. Of destruction of lands and oceans heaved upon space into obliteration.
To close his eyes he would give his immortal soul lest his eyes had been torn from his skull and close they could not. 

No body to corpse.. Gods of the stars are seven
Screams unto silence.. Seven seals used in their turn
Mind is omneity.. Seals to those seven gates
Reflection inception.. Essence and color materialize in seven shapes of gates
No body to corpse.. Gods of the skies are seven
Wrapt unto silence.. Seven seals used in their places
Mind is everything.. Seals to unlock the gates
Reflection deception.. Essence and color materialize
Body render to mind once more as he stood upon grey rock before the void...
Hearken fathers of the suns! I beckon you from your slumber! 

(Beckoning the Zonei)
Barra Xul!
Barra Edinazu!
Barra Anu! 

I descend of seraphic trappings.. To forewarn of a new god! 

Barra Xul!
Barra Edinazu!
Barra Anu!
Conjuration!
Barra Xul!
Barra Edinazu!
Barra Anu!
Resurrection! 

Before the void i stand as silence sings
Unto its bleak veils i call once more
Hearken fathers from the suns! I lament!
Reveal your magnificence unto me.
Slowly as lucifer stood upon ashen rocks the vacuous dimension folded unto itself in ways time, shape and color became as one. Terrible wrath, pain and confusion befell him as he bore witness to one of mighty stature rising before the mists of dimension. A formless shape of elemental construction.
And when they awaken forth.
Upon that forsaken spirit
To raise without shape or form
Lest the invocation invoke chaos
Hear me ancient fathers
Speak thy name unto me
It is i who commands you
It is i who beckons you
It is i whom binds your spirit It is i whom chains your form
As then before the fallen Lucifer a shape was revealed
Then arms did reach out with hands of scale of serpents
With a spear upon its fingers and armor upon body
A crown of tentacles spewing from mouth.. Eyes of jade.. 

"Dead and dreaming.. No longer shall i slumber. I hath heeded your cries specter of hell.. I know of your plight for i have seen it upon your mind. As now i summon my liege!" 

With the raising of its arms a blinding light comes from all directions as shapes of gates appear and a liege of gods as ancient ones would render those luminescent gates unto flame. Lucifer turning did know of victory against an impetuous god of heaven and earth to claim as his own.
Flames of the Zonei! 
Seven in name, shape, and number they are. 
Spirit of the moon remember! 
This the hoarding liege of chaos! 

And as they have awoken forth
Upon my forsaken spirit
Risen as shape and form
Let the invocation invoke chaos
To assail the throne of god
Filling of the cup of vengeance
Spilling the blood of seraphs
I shall claim victory for my own
For it is lucifer who commands you!Born child is like the beginning of the life river immaculate spring-straight as a die
It''s strange to you, me-childish sensibility
Hiding itself in a closed childish world by
Innumerable amount of the sleepy dreams
It''s in longing, tearful eyes
Trustful glance, in great tear-drops
Of childish tears
Will you also buy a machine gun
To your child as a toy?The fire in the sky 
He who gives us light 
The sun - our lord 
Giver of all life 
His coming has been the herald 
The dawn of a new cycle 
For as long as it has been remembered 
It has been this way 

He is life eternal 
The focus of our worship 
We dared not look upon him 
Until this fateful day 

Solo: Macey 

His flames diminish! 
Shadows begin to fall 
At the apex of his journey 
This cannot be so! 
In terror I look into his heavens 
I need not shield my eyes 
Dust rising from afar 
Is swallowing our lord 

Solo: Macey 
Solo: Macey 

The ground trembles 
In the distance thunders roar 
His powers blast the lands 
Fierce winds whip up the sands 
How have we displeased him? 
Not in lack of dedication 
We cower as the skies darken 
Our lord is nowhere to be seen 

Solo: Crompton 

He did not return 
Deserting us in twilight 
Without his solar powers 
Our crops withered and died 
Terrible winter froze the sand 
Killing the sick old and young 
Our faith is all that binds us to 
These lands our lord has left us toWill crimson turn with blood by night 
The fields that early-dew has purified 
The song of battle horn is spreading far 
And makes the foes flash creep 
We'll fight 
Fixed on the horde are the eyes 
Blinded by mist of revenge 
With sunrise 
With the virgin sun-beam 
Our ancient war-call will revive 
We'll survive 
In pale moonlight I remembered my days 
And listened hard to winds in leafage at night 
Talking to Gods 
Who were looking forward to break of the dawn 

Here comes the first ray 
Reflected in armors and chain 
Rune inscribed by my hand 
To heaven of heaven flies 

Quenching thirst of their blades 
To Valhalla fighting through it waits 
Men of honor last and great 
They stood up to their fate 

Revived by the battle is fading the light 
The sward will cut off your war-call from night 
You did know you will be killed 
And fall victim it fate 
Yet never turned back from your from way of might 

The beam's on thy snow white wings 
You've come before I've sunk in oblivion 
Epistle of heaven you're 
In mist of great sorrow 

Jaws of the beast have been stained with your blood 
Blades had been singing in swallowing fight 
Into weeping of wolves the groaning will slowly change 
Fires will be made to honor RevengeBurning cloud descends instantly 
Hellish mountain breathing wind of fire 
All consuming heat-sphere, glowing red 
Catastrophic sky, gaseous funeral pyre 

We all burn 
Cloud of ash 
We all burn 
Pyroclast 

Convection currents rise into the heavens 
Spreading out then falling on homes of man 
Turning eyes above, towards impending doom 
Boiling the waters, scorching the land 

Instant boiling of body fluids 
Massive failure of internal organs 

The reek of burning flesh is lost on my brain dead corpse 
The sight of fallen friends is lost on my sightless soulyou say you won`t
won`t be a victim of natures unrest
Fuse it into a will
I know I will always be caught in this maze

Don`t count the days
Every moment is like a hole in your time
But life is moving on
I know will always be caught in my fate

We can`t make it whole again

The cosmic architect
I started the foundation
The wheel of fortune I am

I am the web of lies
By which your eyes are deceived
I am the hunting call
That lures evil from its sleep

I am the blackest of night
My heart the coven that blots the sight
I am the lightning
The light that rips the heavens open

I am the voice that echoes through your mind
The ghostly noise, the whisper
I chill you to the bone

I am the great deceiver
The one that sewn the lie on your lips
I am the thorn in your side
My grip shatters you like glass
I am the nightmares, all that you fear
The shape that follows you

I am the hammer
My voice is the roaring thunder
I am the wind
My breath is the raging storm
Reaping into your very soul
There is never enough pain

I'm at war with the world 
And every living soul should fear me
For I was God's left hand
I'm tired of being trapped here, down below
In midst of day, beyond the night

I am the eyes in the dark
The pungent stench 
The needle in your eyes
I am all that you dream 

I am the end!(Instrumental)Watching the mirror of human eyes
I'm strangest of evil, I am the fright
Civilization, people's decay
It have to be broken and we'll coming true
Angel of terror, inhuman
As long as it needs will be asleep
Go to your crosses, make your last prays
Let us invade!

Life of your illusions now in my hands
Enslavement and destruction now I know it's never ends
Recombination of the new world, the world of fire magic
I will tell you who knows name of your emperor!
And if ti will be not me, it will be those like me
It will be those... The invasionEverything was bathed in darkness
The forest surrounded each tower of the castle
Betraying nothing but fear and anguish
I wasn't aware of time any more
The feeling of being born among those graves took over me

As if my life had begun in the place where pervaded this death scent
I was wandering among the remnants of forgotten times
The starlight reaching me

And making me believe in another place, where i could be someone else
I was the reflection of a rotting humanity
A pile of scorched flesh
The symbol of an irreversible destruction
Everything was bathed in darkness when i rose,
Wrongly, from the very heart of earthLord of the air and Lord of space
Lord of the birds and the reptile race
Those afraid of his poison jaws
Also flee from his razor sharp jaws
From the egg he killed to feed
Raping what he could to plant his seed
King Dragon is coming for you
He has killed before and he'll kill you too

King Dragon
Lord of this land
All men fear
His iron claw

Leaving the ground and flying through the air
Dying is good for all he cares
Mortal men are of no concern
Immortality is what he's earned
A golden blade is all he fears
None he has seen for a thousand years
But then one day, on dromedary steed
A warrior arrives - A king of weed

Lord of Doom
Draws his sword
Strikes it deep
Dragon is slain!"Excuse me! That, okay, but...that's the last straw."

"I was told I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume."

This is the last straw!

"I believe you have my stapler?"

This is the last straw!

"Okay, but...I'll burn the building down..."(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Supermassive black holes in thought
Aggressive light passive distraught
The sadistic outcome of smoke and clouds
Dead-brain clusters enshroud
Escaping through social atmospheres
You belittle yourself in others fears
Superego meets solar nucleus
This monster leaks moral pus
Soundless night activities boundless bright extremities
Super-powerful galactic overlords
Rearrange the pandemic of starboards4. Without Time

What have you done
during your life ? Say it warrior,
Do youi thing
you have done something significant ?
It's time to show everything you learned.
You walk over the ground,
believing you
know everything, but when you
face reality you'll realise,
you are small and powerless.

[Chorus:]
You can't give up
you are strong enough to fight.
You can't go back
now it's time to face the true.
When the time had come,
you won't have time to get more knowledge
or wisdm you'll be a man
Without light and significance.

You have to fight,
you have to seize
Yourself to all things you love,
you have to fight against the violent one,
The one that locks you into a small world.
Where you'll be alone
No one day,
when you won't have time to run away,
you'll have to show us you have lived to do
everything right.

[Chorus:]
You can't give up
you are strong enough to fight.
You can't go back
now it's time to face the true.
When the time had come,
you won't have time to get more knowledge
or wisdm you'll be a man
Without light and significance.Day and night unglued
Embalmed in secret vertigoes
Ill with the obstinacy of images
Blank pages of history
To revere a false past is to be historically deaf
Night is the collaborator of torturers
Day is the light on harrowing discoveriesMy life, it's evil
My mind possessed by demons
Everlasting hatred
The cold winds of darkness
Dedicated to destruction
I follow the path of death
Always keeping my soul
Out of the deceiving light
Never believe the promises
Of those who promote the lie
Dedicated to destruction
I follow the path of deathThe beginning with the end in mind
To reach new levels one must die a thousand times
Travel outside my kind
Ready to commit, unnatural crimes

A glance of suffering
One peek at death
Bound to watch
The last bloodshed

Masses wear that mask of life
Few can see the light through darkness
Faces of death painted white
Refuse to be burned in earthly nothingness

I walked in circles and saw through their lies
No peace without a conflict
I'm through all your rites
Victory in defeat
A healthy disease
I'm finally ready
But far from finished

I see the face of death
I see the real face of deathFrom birth to death, just a slave,
From birth to death, what am I,
I can't believe in myself,
I can't see past myself, 

Why should I fight [???],
why should I fight, turn my back,
Nothing can hurt me if its not real,
From birth to death, it's all the same 

From birth to death, just a slave,
From birth to death, what am I,
Nothing can hurt me if it's not real,
From birth to death, I'm just the same(Instrumental)(Instrumental)unpredictable and quiet 
malicious and carefree 
dark for some 
useful for other

it's the scourge of man 

In the infinite stands the hardest stone of the universe

horror and shock when you see it 
distress and fear when you feel it 
do you live for it? 
do you live for it? 

but one thing is clear 
it will not give you his opinion 
it will take all without saying a word 
and make you eat by the mice 

In the infinite stands the hardest stone of the universe

Death 
Death

Death 
DeathI hear a chant of Evil

No one stands upon me
No one breathers the same freedom

I swore to Evil

Freedom to the left hand
Barbed wire in right
Halo of meanness rounds my heart
Receptacle of spirit is filled with cold
Dancing on the grave of mercy
I drive nails in compassion
I mix up wind of hope with a cemetery stench
I thrust my fangs in corpse of virtue
Desecrating smouldering ruins
I clear a place for Evil birth
Hand in hand with immortality
I trample down through eternal flames of nether

Flow the slowest poison
I ride on your waves
Bring death, bring grief
Bring tears
Which I will enjoy.....i've been on the ropes for so long.Another sun is falling and
I feel my heart is breaking,
Bur I know you wait for me.
All the day alone,
But your face is now reality,
So I wear my smiling mask
[It will rain, and I still feel myself insane
Oh sweet rain,
I'm gonna feel you on me again]

Now you're far away
In the arms of the angels,
Can you feel me for a while?
Where are you running now? Are you
Living in a better world?
Maybe playing under my sun...

Hey, my dear, I have no fear,
I feel your presence on my skin,
Live my life as passing by,
I long to meet you again...

I know this is your last place, but don't
Know which is your last day,
And my prayers fly in vain
Waiting for that call,
All my days become so rainy,
So I sing sweet rain for you

Hey, my dear, I have no fear,
I feel your presence on my skin,
Live my life as passing by,
I long to meet you again...

[It will rain, and I still feel myself insane
Oh sweet rain,
I'm gonna feel you on me again](Instrumental)Ziekte, verspreidt.
Mijn zicht, verdwijnt.

Duisternis! Duisternis!

Jacht, verkrachting. Moord, vernietiging.

Verkrachting...

Een levenloos consensus, van eenzaamheid en afgunst.
Een melancholisch circus, waar de levenszin vervaagt.

Een wereld waar het licht nog leeft, dolen mensen rond in onwetendheid.
Een infiltratie van warmte, kracht en vuur. een injectie van moeder natuur.Brother Elijah ... a bourbon drinking, violent man
Sister Teresa ... a rosary wrapped around her hand
like so many others, they would drink and fight
like a vagabond he would roam the streets
each and every night
until one April morning, when he did not appear
the telephone rang at the station house
the neighbors watched in awe and fear

A match made in heaven - or was it born in hell
seemed a lovely couple - in this god forsaken town
led outside in shackles - she muttered but one sound
"my peers they will decide my fate"
"I give my soul to this little town"

she laughed and then she cried
"he didn't think I had it in me"
"he coughed and then he died"
"last time he ever laid a hand on me"

"it was a case of self defense"
she smiled upon the stand
she waited till he laid his head
Took the axe into her hand
there was no denying it
the decision handed down
ain't leavin' here in one piece girl
So say the people of this town

she laughed and then she cried
"he didn't think I had it in me"
"he coughed and then he died"
"last time he ever laid a hand on me"The beauty
The terror
The mystery
The pain
With horror 
And exertion
I travelled
So far
Surroundings
Confused 
Projected 
Image
Hopeless
Hideous
Pounding
The unknown
Division

In the hostile

Maddening

Like the vultures

Whirl of waters"What life means to you, my friend?"
A question asked to everyone I know.
It was so simple but carries the weight of mind,
as no one wants to know and even cares about.

Newspapers cover the same stuff everyday:
wars, crimes, disasters, problems still exist
as seen on TV and on Internet.
That costs our time with all those mortal affairs,
wondering why we should be here
surrounded by the literal horrors.
Should we accept this stagnant situation?

Like there's no other way to go,
many have found their ways to live,
creating philosophical types of reactions.
Realize it's only counter-concepts,
none would give a real solution.
Knowledge that comes from these crippled minds:
wars, crimes, disasters, problems still exist.
Register names on "club of ignorance",
partake in the state of confusion
the hearts that have been pierced from both sides...

None shall last forever, not even this life,
for we brought nothing into this world,
we cannot take anything out of the world.
Let's think about tomorrow, seek another day,
heading to the one world beyond, keep the minds free.Proffer the holy ash
To darken all
To cease to exist
Crags and clefts
The shadow cast
Elegy to this beatific
Black and red
The winter's warmth

Of ash and pumice
Make a grave
For our broken trail
To arrive at being all again
To reach satisfaction in all
To revile the earthly loam of all
Our spirits have been exhorted
Before the rosy dawn of white
The desire of the sea with its thousand breasts
Sensation of voluptuousness

All we have burnished
In times of despair
Through days of sorrow
Riding all alone
Abluted ocean
Our buried sopor
Falling ashes
Breaking into pieces

Sacred fire
Peering
Staring
Courses of stone
Prying
Gazing
At the temple

Ascending mounds to find
Ascending mounds to light
Our fires over this sea
Our airs over this soil
I am the wanderer, I am the soul of stone
This is my shade of pain, this is my only flame
This is the last day
This is the last hour
Of our Pompeii
Of this collapsing green

All our founts have dried up
Even the sea has receded
All the ground tried to gape
But the depth will not swallow
Out of glass coffins did burnt life gaze upon me
All life had I renounced, so I dreamed, so I am(Instrumental)I call to waters, (I call to skies)
Let's welcome home all absent minds
Proclaim a messiah (here and now)
Forever too late

Act like seen something greater
Now taking shape in this paradox
Where children went wrong to begin with
And no one ever smiled

We are beta!
(We are beta!)

Forcing down only ourselves
Needing a source to serve
Begging for life through death
(Forcing down only ourselves
Needing a source to serve
Searching for life through Death)

Thus insane, though never deranged
Can absence strike any further
Make a way, hell of a happy way
Love and mushrooms

I call to soil, I call to fire
Through time and loss each found their pyre
Proclaim a messiah here and now
Forever too late

Thus insane, though never deranged
Can absence strike any further
Make a way, hell of a happy way

In the middle of the night
Two dead men
Got up to fight
Back to back
They faced each other
Drew their swords
And SHOT each otherAll your dreams have turned into an irreversible death trap
Time to kiss your life goodbye and take the final fateful step
Here comes Dystopia, you achieved the blackest one
Blood will flow; you bear the end of everything

Lies, corruption, death construction
Pinned upon your blood production
Violate all sanity
Desecrate identity
Death or integrity

Unfeeling within their hearts
Washed away Utopia
Clinging to their Slavery
An orchestrated destiny

At the height of their perfection
The abyss of their own distraction
Life abandons the blackened rose
The curtain is about to close

Youth keeping by life taking
Truth seeking is no sane thing
Hail progress, hail our kind
Opposition equalized
A new design of mindsFate your pleasure increaces
As a friendly undead morning acid
You started to feed a power into
Your harmless piece of human
A hole means ahead on the bed of scale
Sliting a body to liquid
A land driving man through a better plan
To serve as well as virgin

Kill 'em with pain determind anger on your side
Speard 'em like misery it could be sadden end
See all beyond a mist creeping to the last
There's nothing else to feel voices turning away

Seal to a chest you can't sleep too well
To be paranoid
The door is a mania influence for a light
Dark means more than bright

Beat your friend till he's braindead
Dont ever think about what you've done
Feel your rage and madness
Bored to be socially influenced
Kill your mother don't hate her
Your mouth full of words you want all to hear
Kill your son be friendly
Just wanna tell aloud your way

Access to fever face in a mirror
Sucking your pity like hell
Disdain, anguish, you have some death
To bring yourself to meDrowned in blood is your god 

Your words come too late 
Your influence has faded 
Ruined all your thoughts 
I'll never be yours 

Drowned in hate.. i'll not wait 

The greed made you blind 
I'll leave you behind 
On fortune i'll pass 
Your damn haughtiness 

I'll search the giant roots 
Until i've gon through my boots 
I'll follow the old 
And forget what you've told 

And if it takes a hundred years 
And if i have to suffer a thousand torments 
To conquer the highest mountains and deepest rivers 
I'll keep looking until i find him 

The ancient path 


The ancient path - way of the forebear 
Far from the wrath everything becomes clear 
Path 


The truth i have found. 
A dignified ground 
But everything all that surrounds me 
Is marked from gaping woundsThe fucking stench 
The stench of the bodies 
Which fills the air 
Is all part of my hobby 

The corpses are dead 
And without souls 
One was my friend 
Whom I now not know 

I'm fucking sick 
Sick of them all 
They all were cruel 
Cruel and harsh 
None of them cared 
Cared for me 
They now are dead 
Remove the dead bodies 

Dead bodies (Repeat 5 times)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)WHY IS IT JUST AN ILLUSION? 
WHY IS IT JUST AN IMAGINATION? 
OLD STONE DREAMS ABOUT THE TEARS 
LOOK THERE 
WHY IT'S JUST A DREAM ? 
WHY IT'S JUST A WAY ? 
I THOUGHT I WILL STAND HERE 
HERE IN NEVERLAND 
MY LIFE It A SAD JOURNEY 
MY LIFE IS LONLEY ADVENTURE 
YOU'RE LOOKING ON THOUGHTS OF DESIRE 
LOOK A DESIRE 
MY LIFE IS SMELL OF WOMAN 
MY LIFE IS JUST A MEAT 
TO LOOK THE BEAUTY 
TRUST A DEATH 

IT'S TIME OF SHADOW'S DESIRE 
COMMON FASCINATION FOR FLESH 
LOOK AT THE ACT OF LOVE 
DIVERSIFIED BY WORLDS AND SUFFER 
UNLEASH THE PAIN BY SENS 
IT'S THE THOUGHTS MASSACRE 
ON THE WAY TO DEATH 
IT'S TIME FOR THE BLEEDING ART 

BLOODY THOUGHTS ARE MY FAITH 
BELIEF IN FLESH NOT IN GOD 
IT'S TIME FOR LAST WORLDS 
PRAYER WHICH IS NOT A DREAM 

I FUCK A WOMAN, BUT SHE'S NOT HER 
WHO ARE YOU ? I HATE YOU 
I KNOW WHY ? BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT HER

We've passed many times,
But very soon we will fall. 

This Earth bleeds for us,
But we don't appreciate it well.
There is perfect balance inside, 
So Earth starts to react.

Earthquakes, eruptions,
Earth sends us a messages.
How far our greed goes?
It will burry us alive.

Soon the Earth will clean itself.

Time taken to relinquish.. intensity and conflict.. within and without
internal struggle to break through the thorns

visions of extinction for us all
put up the walls to protect myself
keep it all out - regaining my solitude

everything is hollow, everything is shallow
I NO LONGER WISH TO BE APART OF THIS WORLD

Thorns tearing at my existance
ripping through my resolve
I don't believe in a light at the end of the tunnel
Only occasional flashes in the thick blackness

Instigating my demise, yet staying alive
This internal struggle, warring within

My existance is a field.. set aflame... and turned to ashes...You're a demon sent from hell
Worminfested V.D. ridden well
Come to taint mankind with your sin
You're laughing and sure you'll win

Stare at me, expecting fear

This time justice knocks you down
Your end - this is my round

Evil raping evil

Fill you up
Drain your life away
Root it out

A quivering mass of fear
You know your death is near

Gateway of the just
Satan shall not passI am walking in the field
the fog is surrounding my body
still a light inside me
is guiding me through
my soul blurred of thoughts
how to get out of this misery
and i'm blind as like my soul
and my journey has just begun

Never ending trips through darkness
leaded by unknown forces
my sorrow is taking over my mind..

Now when there is nothing left
i'm still wandering here
the light is fading
and darkness arrives
the souls are gathered together
they are all screaming in pain
still I cannot hear a sound
all the screaming will be so vain

Never ending trips through darkness
leaded by unknown forces
my sorrow is taking over my mind
I'm never returning to earth..

In the end I reach my destination
eternal life somewhere
the past is forgotten
and future is doomed
and i'm feeling so empty
like there's nothing here
my life was a sorrowful tale
but i've come to an endNothing but blood, Shot in the face, the guts and the neck
Nothing but blood, shot in the back, the skull and the throat.

In a new Hi-Tech world
Next synthetic drug
The brain turned to stone
It's scratching your eyes
Stealing your life
eating your brain
and taking your soul

A few years among four walls
Just technology is your friend
Cigarette smoke of your home
inside your alone like the pawn
...like the pawn... the chess pawn

Long ago you lost reality
Also like an old identity
So go to the next game and be quiet
The imagined troops are ready to fight

Unrational thing subverts your life
Like a drill to the brain, last pieces of mind
The maze of torment is a new fucking game
Your next excitement like a shot to the vein
Heeps of rubbish and dirt are around you

Your beautiful house is changing to a ruin
It's not necessary, talk to any person
They aren't from your false world
The family left you a long time ago
It didn't move with your ego
But your computer soldiers never lose
Kill your enemies, your cunning always rules

...like the pawn... the dead pawnMy phonetics teacher caught my eye
By removing her blouse
Some ladies take pity on our situation
But quickening my pulse
Can cause an irregular palpitation

My doctor said that excitement
Such as my phonetics teacher's breasts
Can cause a reaction that can lead to death
My system has no ability
To withstand stress

And so here I sit, alone
Another Friday night
Without the chance to cruise Durian Avenue
I watch television, listen to music
Wish for inspiration, or death

Could Eckankar help?They said "a soul will suffice"
The beings from beyond the edge of sleep
These dreams have become a predator
Ominous and foreboding thoughts
In seclusion from my reality
These walls I thought I knew
Bear no semblance of what I recall
The stench of death pervades my home
And my waning serenity

Fear not, for your time has come
Your life is a feckless blight
Upon our masterpiece of chaos
The joy of orchestrated pain
Seen in the eyes of those in death
Will be our ominous delight

Horrified, by the reality before me
A shattered world, wrought by decay
Raining down droplets
From the blackest obsidian
Ever growing mounds of strewn bodies
Take the place of those I knew
Can this truly exist
Or am I simply still dreaming?

Fear not, for your time has come
To enter into our domain
As we feast upon your offering
The joy of consuming your flesh
For which we can no longer wait
Shall be our ominous delight

Enigmatically disoriented
This wretched vision of a world
Torn asunder, mottled with rot and decay
Familiar faces replaced by hollowed cadavers
As this world is but a horrifying reminder of what once was
The sound, in the distance, a scream for life
Stifled by the clamor of death

These thoughts are not my own, but these images I see
Are they real or hallucination?

Lost in this consternation
Deafened by silence and horrified
By the balk of nothingness.
One is left to wonder
What became of my old world.
This place is not home
All is a formless void of chaos

We will rend your insides
Dissect your essence
To see what makes your soul sing
We will revel in your loss of life
Serenity is no longer your bedfellow
Welcome to oblivion
Welcome to oblivion(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Bullshits
LiesThe cry essaying the waters; 
The autumn gale that bites the vine 
And announces the new wine. 
In the forest I dreamed of 
One hundred blossoming roses. 
A scent of sunshine 
Shields what is yet to unfold.(Instrumental)Coffin purporting Grandfather Clock
Adorning insane hieroglyphs
Extraneous hands gesture my entrance
Therin impossible angles of
Transdimensional interior

Through angles

Through curvesTake one step backwards
And live forever

Take one step forward
And die forever

I stand still forever
And soon disappear in the illusion
So what does it fucking matter
If I step backwards or forwards
I'm dying forever

I'm dying forever
I'm dying forever
I'm dying forever
I'm dying forever
I'm dying forever
I'm dying forever
I'm dying forever
I'm dying foreverI am from a proud race
Power in my blood and bones
MY lineage has fought in every war
my universe has ever known.
I was a soldier, a HERO! just like my dad and his old man
til the Great Berr-Eetoh War, left me bloodied and broken in the sand.

Then they brought him to the Dahk-Tooooooooore!

I'll Fix you up so you're not falling apart.
Replace your dying organs with bionic parts.
Fix the joints in your legs, new feathers on your face.
And enhanced robotic hands so you can slap that bass!

REBORN!
A feathery cyborg
Preach the Divine word
I've had my fill of war.
I read from ancient tomes and scripts
written by the wisest creatures to exist.
We know how to, spread peace thruout the land.
And we'll tell you in a language you won't understand.(Instrumental)To catch a glimpse of your face
Through a fleeting moments grace
Coincides with the peace in my heart
Tied is the time in an hourglass
No moment too long to consider the past

Lose your mind
No time
Time untied
Look inside
No time
Time untied

Like fallen leaves, I lay on the ground
Let the rain wash me away
I feel sin without injustice
Like heartache without the love

To live forever in this way
So my soul cannot decay
Coincide with a structure unflawed

Live alive
No time
Time unwind
No mind

No time
Time untied
Live alive
Look inside
Lose your mindWHERE IS YOUR FORGOTTEN BEGINNING
WHAT HAND HAS THROWN YOUR LOT ON THIS PLACE
EVERY YOUR HAIR IS FROM ANOTHER LAND
EYES ARE CLASHING FOR LONG TIME
HANDS ARE BATHING IN THOUSANDS OF RIDES
AND MOUTH FULL OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS
I DON'T KNOW YOUR BROTHERS, I DON'T KNOW YOUR SISTERS
LABIRYNTH HAS CLOSED RELATED LINES
IF YOU WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED IN TIME 
YOU MUST FIND NAME AND YOUR NUMBERS(Eklundh)

This is the wrong year
This is the wrong year
Believe me, I'm sincere
We could use some help here

This is the wrong year

The planet's state's a bloody mess
You and I could not care less
Bored we look the other way

The more we learn the less we know
Our way of life just has to go
It's about to ricochet

Do we get what we deserve?

This is the wrong year
This is the wrong year
Believe me, I'm sincere
We could use some help here

This is the wrong year

Simple fact: first we fry
We don't act: well, then we die
A global abscess hard to ignore

Tomorrow is a little late
Can you afford to wait?
Indolent we consume some more

We need to cut Tellus some slack
Endangered species won't come back
And we will all pay for sure

Do we get what we deserve?The Way Of The Sword

Our honour
our pride
belongs to you
our swords
will kill for you
All who stand against us
are standing against you
escort us on our way
To win this battle
guide our swords and shields
We wade through
till the victory is ours
You are the one who ensures
that our men return home proudly
you make heroes out of them
for they die as heroes
You are the king the cherusker
standing over all kings
your strength is what we remember
you live in us for all times
The spirit of the swords
forged in pagan flames
execute our willnot lost. but gone before.
deposited at the brink of time. across the borders of infinity.
atomized state. crystalized existence. linear-time ignored.
indescent wings take me home.
from within john wheelers hyperspace.
the secret disclosed. neither body nor radiation.
vanished to outside observers. those poor souls left behind.Your mindless chants show your brain to be dead
How can you all be so easily led?
Your forced with bullshit, you think it's right
You'll keep your security, you're safe because your white
You'll not be needed, just pawns in their game
The tables will turn, you'll be treated the same
Middle-aged business men will seize the power
You'll realize to late your dreams have turned sour

These mindless chants
Of those bigotted thoughts(Instrumental)Dead
Stiff and cold
In your box
To decay
DeadWe all serve our inner beast, faceless breathing us deceit.
This keeps nurturing our sons, will we ever stop?

Do you know what's that you are carrying, growing in your womb?
Nurtured from your soulless void, don't blame this unwanted child.

Mother what's this you are feeding me with?
Father is this your sacred legacy?

So perennial and yet so ephemeral we are all!
They will feed in with the most, deep form of hate, it's all wrong!

A beast we have all conceived, not pain we should give him peace.
End this bloodline of deceit, born in pure misanthropy.

Stop! it's not late for this child we have bred! we must save its pure soul, from the void and pain this race lives and gives to all its sons, we must stop this right now!

One soul is killed each time we lie, this feeds our beast!
Don't pass your fears and failures to your "loved" son!
We are delivering beasts into this world, the unborn child is feeding on your deceit.

A beast we have all conceived, not pain we should give him peace.
End this bloodline of deceit, born in pure misanthropy.We walked, hand in hand
Through the land of our hopes and fears
We did not stray 
We never looked back
Forward was our only cause
Ahead was our destination
For the love contained within you, I would walk forever
Through paths unnumbered and days uncounted, I will follow you
My love, my love... Forever...Is this my destiny, An end to my days 
Is there nothing left for me to ease the pain 
oh, ease my pain 

time and time again I find the writing on the wall 
what it means to me is something I cannot recall 
if I believe the words I hear from voices in my head 
then grip these chains and tie me down to slavery instead 
no way out - the hand of fate, that's what it is to be 
no way out - and it's too late as far as I can see 

...It's a game, but I'm not playing nice 
...I'm not going down without a fight 
I'm raising hell and cutting down the dead men in my way 
if I go down then all go down it is my judgement day 
the irony is tyranny will rain on my parade 
but I wont rest until my enemies are laid to waste 
...it's a game but I'm not playing nice ...I'm not going down without a fight 

I struggle with the realization 
that my life is held in someone elses hand 
the evil hand that deals the cards and tells me what I am 
...It's a game, but I'm not playing nice ...I'm not going down without a fightTake me away
I can't handle all this pain
Your absence hounds this game

Break away from this emptiness
Who is the winner or the loser?
I don't care...

When you're in my arms
Everything seems right
Like a vivid dream
I'm diving to your stream

Like a rhyme of a false orchestra
We're rising again from the ashes
Love is our guide through the haze

Like a rhyme of a false orchestra
Traveling into this daydream
Love is the only way

Hold my hand
Lead me to innocence
Hypocrisy drowns my soul(Instrumental)Fall asleep
In the midst
Of my body
With a longing
For night
To come
Encapsulate
All of my mistakes
I see no end in sight
Where are my
Friends
When the dark comes
I won't give a fuck
Nothing but
Love
Exists

Fall asleep
In the midst
Of my body
With a longing
For night
To come
Encapsulate
All of my mistakes
I see the end in sight
Where are my
Friends
When the dark comes
I won't give a fuck
Even love is a facade
Even love is a facade
Nothing but
Death exists(Instrumental)I travelled far and wide 
Searching..... 
On paths trodden 
Only by so few 
I uncover the doorway 
My journey nears its end 
I complete the ritual 
Which grants me passage unto - 

This ancient tomb 
Of kings - I open 
I break the seal 
Of three thousand years 
What foul enchantment 
Will befall me? 
What will I 
Behold? 

Leaving the sun behind 
Down passages so dark 
The torch my only weapon 
Against this vault of darkness 
Soon I lose my way 
Attempt to trace my footsteps 
My torch fading fast 
As I see a chink of light 

My pace quickens 
Running towards the distant glow 
I stumble on the entrance 
The awesome spectacle brings me to my knees 

I behold the tomb of kings 

On huge pedestals they stand 
Mounted, weapons in hand 
Once kings of this land 
Their statues stand 
Monarchs long forgotten 
Rising towards the light 
Once proud lords 
Will rise again...... 

Terror in the air 
Ancient tombs opening 
Grotesque figures emerging 
Still dressed in regal splendour 
Followed by their servants 
Entombed when their lord died 
Empty eyes look towards the surface 
As foretold: They rise again 

Solo: Maceychapter "The first noble truth"
inked in unreadable fonts
an extinct mother-tongue manipulates cognition
a foreign transmittance of soothing senses, 
paled nerves
formulating some noble feeling;
something pleasant,
something peaceful
during the apnea of realism.
empowering one's mental duress,
a navigable and willing mind,
controlling the awe of immunity
and dynamism's of tranquility
all perennial when read.Heed conspirators! Hear my call!
The abyss is waiting for you all.
The truth is in demand...

Smoke and mirrors hide the lies
It's time to tear down the thin disguise
What you find there. You'll not believe

Theory or reality.
The truth or the lie.
Which ever path you choose to take.
Be sure the reason why

A time is coming. When we will see
Behind your veil of reality.
Don't change your shape now.
Stay in the shadows!

Point the finger, deflect the blame
You have the power, but we'll die the same.
Your one-eyed god-he watches you...

Theory or reality.
The truth or the lie.
Which ever path you choose to take.
Be sure the reason why(Instrumental)Another lonely night in your head
This is only a matter of mind
And when you play this game your whole life
How can you say if it is wrong or right ?

You can wait for a change of your mind
this is only a matter of time
And when you close your eyes overnight
He will awake in the bright moonlight

I don`t know how these feelings change
It must be more than only Jekyll and Hyde

Take the pain lose again
He is a friend you know
a spotlight there on my own Error again
Different minds in ordinary minds
fill them up with all that we are willing to want and like
no one is searching but I want to know
To end up my day

Is that how you get into my eyes
When people lose their way
It`s the opposition of me
But he is strange to everyone
It doesn`t lead me astray

Different minds in ordinary minds
Fill them up with all that you are wiilling to want and like
No one is searching but I want to know
to end up my day

Oceans flow in my veines
Demons - do we need to fear ?

Sometimes a distant spying sattelite
The put on mascerade is alright
So if you call him the master of your mind
He will show you his world in moonlight
When people lose their way...
It doesn`t lead me astray

Different minds in ordinary minds
Justifys the cause to fail
Different eyes see all that even minds
A spotlight there on all who are not willing to tryWalk your own path through the hell and the wrath 
Embrace this world to which you've been cast 
Never had a home? This is where you belong 
The world you love is forever gone 

Welcome home, we'll set you free 
All I need's for you to follow me 
You've chose this life, don't beg and plead 
You've succumbed to the damned and deceived 

Wicked are the ways of the damned and deceived 
Been cast upon this place from their own deeds 
Sent here to repent and bask in regret 
Mistakes they've made and won't forget 

You're a man without a mind, 
Just an empty shell 
You're better off dead 
You belong in hellThe primitive is full of rage
the simple mind is so afraid

The players built this war scenario to scare us, so
they took our freedom to make money, now, where do we go?

It's far too late,
cause you've swallowed all their lies
It's far too late,
now you watch your children die
It's far too late,
now you're choking on their lies
It's far too late,
you will watch your children die
It's far too late...

Their greedy minds are full of hate,
they will destroy your life, just wait.

Your prayers echo in the blackest void, you can't avoid
you're going down, cause you have missed to show them the red light

It's far too late...Chaotic Resemblance

Enter the chaotic
Resemblance of a world
Beyond the distant aeons

The structure
Of a future universe
We are unable to comprehend

The dark room
In which I'm held
To prevent me
From fullfulling
The Prophecy
Of the journey
For mankinds
Salvation

There is a fabled planet beyond all gallaxies
A different universe still in fragments
It strives to summon itself
Our arrival and breeding is it's only purpose

This cryptic story ends with my sigh
As I lay down my vision fades
No journey will ever be made
As my mind is to unbalanced

I draw my sight from the ceiling
And completely loose focus(Instrumental)Excised and anatomised, deviscerated disarray 
The torso diverged with pride 
Deftly amputated, evulsed limbs now defunct 
The trunk imbrued, tatty stumps used as lugs 
For a chondrin puzzle so quaint 
Head and body decollate 
A heaving mass so quiescent... 

Scattered and scrambled, your teasement grows 
- A bloody caricature to make whole 
A squirming grisly jigsaw, detrital fragments fit so snug 
- That missing piece will leave you stumped 
Totally desassembled, nicely sliced and diced 
- A cold mannequin once resembled 
Real cranium teaser, carved from flesh and bone 
- So mystifying... 

Battered and diffused, with placating blows 
- A human jigsaw to make whole 
A sequacious pattern which once fitted so snug 
- Joining together each dubious lump 
Ravaged disassembly, neatly cubed and diced 
- A cold mannequin reassembled 
Astute brain teaser, incorporate flesh and bone 
So mortifying... 

An incessant game - methodically made 
With each cumulative piecing - of commensated meat... 

Bi-manual reconstruction, eldritch problem complete 
A convented effigy 
A pathological toy, each chunk rigorously 
Inter mortis locking, as you pathogenically rot 
Such a perplexing task 
To fit the remains in the casket 
Uliginous mess so quiescent... 

(Lead: Human Jigsaw by W.G. Steer) 
(Lead: A heaving organic puzzle by M. Amott) 

An incessant game - methodically made 
With each cumulative piece - of commensated meat...Just a fight in the darkest night
A magical journey in my mind
That's how I feel when I'm with you brothers
Asgard is so far away

Allfather - hold your hand above us
Allfather - your eye is watching us

Just a fight - my life fades to grey
Jost a fight - to the hall of the king
Just a fight - one day I will go to Asgard
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win

The moon casts shadows, shining
On the ground in the dark deep night
Unreal light all around the field
Reaching for the sword, I can't fight anymore

Allfather - hold your hand above us
Allfather - your eye is watching us

Just a fight - my life fades to grey
Jost a fight - to the hall of the king
Just a fight - one day I will go to Asgard
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win

My life fade to grey, Asgard hails welcome
The great halls of the one-eyed king
I can never lose, only win
Only win

[Solo Thorsten]

Just a fight - my life fades to grey
Jost a fight - to the hall of the king
Just a fight - one day I will go to Asgard
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win
Just a fight - Asgard hails welcome
Just a fight - the battlefield is my home
Just a fight - one day I will go to glory
Just a fight - I can never lose, only winIn the ancient time, life derived from trash.
Nature's garbage bag- a generative seedbed.
Animalia, all taxonomies. 
All voracious, animals with human faces.
A maze of hostilities.
You must submit, civilization won't exist.
All the selfishness & danger on this planet.
Man crawled from the oceans in a panic.

The She-Bear.
The rat king.
Manhog.

Jaguar, stand up and talk!
Have you known the Antichrist in a deep sleep?
A deep sleep?

Sacrifice.
The Snakewife.
The wife.Gave you flowers 
To seal the shit off my face 
I'm losing 
What's always been lost 

Although I've said there's nothing
And I'm dead 
So contagious 
Tears of god 

There's no right 
Too many thoughts 
Tried for me and you and all my loveBetween the idea
And the reality
Falls the shadow
between the motion
And the act
For thine is the kingdom
Between the conception
And the creation

This is the way the world ends
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the shadow
Between the desire
And the spasm
Life is very long

Between the potency
And the existence
Between the essence
And the descent
Falls the shadow

This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper(Instrumental)Lucifer
We are here
For your praise

And smear the smudge in bleeding palms

we are kept in order 
kept in line we do not change 
we do not or alter? 
Why can we not see it 
we aren't getting any closer 
to the answer 
the search is far from over? 

We never see an end 
to these blacken skies 
Why instead of truth 
do we follow lies? Why? 

All is only as real as you've made it so 
What is real? 
What is real? 
What is real? 

False truth! true lies! false truth! 
True lies! false truth! true lies! 
False truth! true lies! false truth! 
True lies! false truth! 

Is there somewhere an end 
to these blacken skies? 
Why instead of truth 
do we follow lies? Why? 

Just because 

All is only as real as you've made it so 
What is real? 
What is real? 
What is real?

What is real? 
What is real? 
What is real?(Instrumental)Serious game all anger versus my fate
Leave me alone to sleep
The circle of waste
Psychiatric pistol has raped
Fingers of a lovely room
No matter how they regard
Mirror is silent and dark
Wasting their apologies
I'm spinnig around on the floor
The flat seems to hold on my thoughts
Space full of sands that burns

Bring me a sanctuary
Wear it with the favorite dress
Open the faint lie
Brick has fallen down to ice

Living my days with pity feelings
Roam into me again
Head under fire's swallowed
You resist my belief
Can I hear your scared mind

Deception in this world
Colours the negative
I've been a lost part
Examination of hunt

Describe my liberty
Never ending warfare
Files are the guns that point
Against my trust

The resplendence of vanity
Tubes through mysterious hunt
Sepulchral prints on my dignity
I'm the capture of their penalty

Over reactive are the roots of cancer
Mentally dead I am
The circle of waste
Psychiatric pistol has raped
Fingers of a lovely room

Bring me a sanctuary
Wear it with the favorite dress
Open the faint lie
Brick has fallen down to ice

Describe my liberty
Never ending warfare
Files are the guns that point
Against my trust

The resplendence of vanity
Tubes through mysterious hunt
Sepulchral prints on my dignity
I'm the capture of their penalty

Describe my liberty
Never ending warfare
Files are the guns that point
Against my trust

The resplendence of vanity
Tubes through mysterious hunt
Sepulchral prints on my dignity
I'm the capture of their penaltyI come to bare my enamored suffering. To offer wounds as a catalyst to passion.
I languor with desire and yet shudder before your presence. The ever One. How perfect the grief and the romance. How tired the soul to wander such desolate lands. To truly know the cold. Let us into martyrdom without conceit. Let us give as we take. Let us embrace silence as attentiveness. Let us love in oceans of anguish. At your feet, I lay but filth and burden... for all I am, I give. The vast sea, deep with mystery to traverse, drop by drop is joined as one in eternity. Pour into me as I pour into Your bottomless depths, Creator. Creation. The ever One... the Father who forged all, the Son who saved all, the Spirit that guides the painfully adoring. Immortal name of our King upon high... reign now and forever. We bow and adore Thee, the ever one.As the bodies decay 
I feel a certain dismay 
About the times I pray 
Below my altar 
Altar... 

I smell the wretched stench 
Of what life now has gone 
Into an interlude of pure 
Black, death, doom... 

DOOM! (5 times) 

What may soon become 
My grief I've overcome 
Loyalty I have done 
My arch oath...... And vow 

As the bodies decay!Talking with people is weird
because when you think you can trust in them
when you think they are nice
they simply deceived you
No more sand, here it's full of skulls
No more sun, here it's huge fire
Skeletons invade this place
Skeletons brings you into darkness
A filthy grave, upon the silence
Beneath the ground, you can listen to scream
Silence is what you give me after giving you
my trust, but's too late you are one of them now
Burn slowly in hell, Share my nightmares
Don't come close to me, don't even look at me
Don't pretend, be yourself, just a shit as you are
Fanatic god prayers, common give me a break!
Through my place, i walk quietly
watching all of these insanity
Piece of flesh, open chest, they are heartless
Shotgun fire...
Damn i guess this one is for me
Just the time to stand up in front of you
Mister, so sorry you got a many big holes in your head
See, blood splash, your dead fucker
And enough time to come behind you
You will be soon another skull on the ground...Quandu judex est venturus 

 Dies irae, dies illa

 Pray the master, pray the lord 
 Feel the anger, fear them all 
 Just delirious in my head 

 Cuncta stricte discussurus 

 Pray the master, pray the lord 
 Feel the anger, fear them all 
 Just delirious in my headEverytime I see you
I wanna pull out your entrails
hang em up for decoration
for fuckin' christmas decoration
I wanna feed you aborted baby meat
and watch you die(music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Buratto)

Strong emotions
when I can see my face inside your eyes...
from these lights on 'till the last line... my words upon your smile

I'll take you high tonight
I'll make you feel alright
jumping up and down dressed up like clowns side by side

//chorus
I'm on my way now
take your wings and fly
and may the wind carry you to dance with the stars
oh, have a nice trip my friends, wherever you go
I hope your way takes you far
maybe one day we'll meet on the road

Oh, one day we'll meet on the road
Oh, yeah, maybe we'll meet on the road

A merry-go-round
from show to show
along your road, don't turn around
Another day, another night on the stage
a place that I call home

Now put out your soul 
and hear the highway call
Go to sleep in a town
and wake up with the sounds of another one

//chorus

//bridge

Now is the time to leave and turn the page
I want to live my life on stage and not die in a cage
and there's a world outside for you every day
I say come on, come on, come on! Come on take it.
Come on and take it now!

O,h have a nice trip my friends wherever you'll go
I hope your way takes you far away

//chorus

Oh, maybe we'll meet on the road
Oh, yeah, maybe we'll meet on the roadremember that guy zool
yeah the guy from ghostbusters
well he aint shit
not compared to odin
all hail the fire of odinThe walls seem
To match
The colour of
What si flowing
From your chest
And running wild

A vibrant soul
Whose only goal
Is to twitch and die
A wretched spoil
Writhing in
Its own waste

I waited so long for you
As you waited here for me
Then I welcomed you with
A closed, spiked glove

Poison in your veins
The taste of metal on your tongue
The guilt of wronging
A feeling missing in your heart

Swallow me...Sell out everything.
Free hands for crooks.
Apologies for killers.
Prosecution for victims.
Act as if nothing ever happened.
When the dirty money warms up your pockets
Then play it off side and blame somebody else
As I see and feel all this - I wanna go and punish
All the political scum backs - kick, hit, beat.
Nothing is functioning.
People got no places to live
This fucking state where the mob
of those, who were in power before rules.
I will kill
Go to castle
and make defenestrationBlackened whites hovering the hall
I float although I smell the fall
Freezing winds creeping me whole
Winter starts to play its role

Darkness shivers the complexion of light
Hunger of its shadows slowly ignites
Dancing they rise bathing in might
Crumbling my long dead sight

Life freezing though I feel no cold
I lie covered in this white mold
Fearing my story will never be told
Drowned in the darkness of my world
My frozen thoughts escaping north
Tormented by feelings they could not behold
Thoughtless, numb, bitter and old
I think I will embrace this cold- The Endings of Chaos - 0:00 

From the Darkened Waters...
Marduk shall rise from winged elemental crests to the darkened earth as ancient rule
has reveled for centuries of chaos where in the race of men has cried fourth from

Lords of eternal time! Hear my cries! King of all magick Marduk we beckon 
you fourth from your infernal eternal slumber! Conjuration! Rise!
Dark Waters have risen...
Marduk has journeyed from winged elemental crests to our darkened earth, 
where ancient rule has reveled for centuries of chaos, where as our race of 
men has cried fourth from infernal evanesence...
Rise upon us lord of all from your sleep to claim our earth from ancient rule who

Yet leap through the vortex does Absu rise combined also with forces of Tiamat 
gained knowledge of the conjuration of Marduk.. 
Hold fast the ancient ones grasp upon our land not to allow the binding of the 
elder ones to reclaim the throne of Kia... Let thee be told!
Many a leige pass upon the vortex as monsters brought fourth by the call of the 
ancient ones as so by a name a shape and number...

Hear your name from the call of Absu.
Through the land Uggae leaps abound.
To call names of war through chaos...
Marduk rises forth upon land to hearken fourth the winged fates... A call from the 
end of time to open wide the eternal gates...
Absu hearken lest ye fall to ancient heart shall Marduk call...
The sky to blaze of hazen night to summon forth the elder rite...
Lest maelstrom take its hold on all and realm of Kia shall befall...
Elders rise to take their stand as Ancients claim this realm of man... 
Upon the sky winged fates howl of war to lands wherein no time does exist to 
realms void of light. Kia Alal Kanpa! Destroyer of earth remember! 
Yet pass the gates of Uggae do they fly... 

- Leigons of the Graves - 0:54

Cries of war... does Marduk howl... as the Elders... raise upon the Ancient...
ones to reseize the realm of Kia in names unformed of shape, number, or form...
Cry of war as winged fates fly...
Beyond realms of time yet through the vortex...
Sword of might...struck upon fate... 
As the beast did... fall upon those dark waters! 
To silence all cries of the winged...
The insumountable creature from its grave! 
Does it ponder the howl of fates...
Amidst cries of war the beast does rise... 
Of fire! Marduk struck fourth a fiery disk! Lashing upon the life of Absu to 
render the beast silent. Rays of death! Dead but dreaming life... 
Past the oceans to summon fourth the Elder liege!
Hear me! Liege of chaos... 
Come forth and render the Ancient fires as coal yet iced winds blowing! 
Struck upon the Ancient ones As Nergal did fall as first slain.. 
Names of death of war! A blaze! 
As rage did fill the eyes of Tiamat who struck forth with winds of winters bane!
As risen from its watery grave the beast does pass upon the vortex
Elder gods did turn pale with fear as the beast did draw ever near
Zi Kia Kanpa Kutulu Barra! 
Dark waters did recede and the beast now howls of war to the fates

- Shadows of the Sky - 3:87

Marduk did sense a presence
As did the Ancient ones truely
And all turned pale with fear
For fear the beast would appear
Spirits of the blazen sky remember thee whom slain did die
Spirits of the deadened sky hear thee lord Cthulhu's cry
As gates flew wide the beast came forth 
Pale with fear were those whom did hear
Spirits of the darkened sky heaken as the winged fates fly
Shadows darkened the land and sky
Barra Xul!
Dark Waters have risen...
Marduk has journeyed from winged elemental crests to our darkened earth, 
where ancient rule has reveled for centuries of chaos, where as our race of
men has cried fourth from infernal evanesence...Risen upon us lord of all 
from your sleep to claim our earth from ancient rule who slayed your son 
ereshkigal befall this plain...
A blaze in the sky the leigon to fly upon broken night the kingdom takes flight..
Hearing the cry these winged do fly.. Who shall it be? CTHULHU!...

- Of a new Chapter - 1:11

Names of death were called to them all!
Absu fell as its life fluid did spill upon the land.. The fates did draw upon the 
sands of time! Marduk cried forth his plea to be heard by him.. Hearken as the 
fates did draw upon the sand! The dark waters did flow red with the fluid of Ancient 
ones. As the Elder ones did recede from the land claimed of Cthulhu
Race of men would befall
Cthulhu has claimed this realm
Did Marduk perish with those, Upon winged elemental crests...Creatures born to fear the light
gather for a night flight
hideous wind, rusty air
they are bounding for cold moon's glare

where trees walk at night
when those who embrace light get blind
no kindness shall be in sight
no foulness ever falls behind

I've dropped the evil doctrine
I've become shapless in return
I've become nameless and fearless
and I bear ultmost ruthlessness

We have no life no death
we are of immense wealth
We are no evil no foul
even the sun fears our glow

Retreating were the hordes of foul
retreating were you
kindness never lives the night
we barely have it in mind

I've dropped the evil doctrine
I've become shapless in return
I've become nameless and fearless
and I bear ultmost ruthlessnessWelcome to the world of violence,
hear the chants of hate,
where all anger and confusion
mixed down all this way.
Society won't take the blame
on these brutal acts.
Burning people, torture, killing,
what else can I say?

Blood is spilled on the ground,
body laid down in weakness.
They won't hear his pleading
when they pour the gasoline.
Paid in full for a little crime,
man, he's been kicked and beaten.
No more chance to escape,
just wait for his last breath.
Burn! Die!

Something sure must happen
if law is not functioning.
When the crimes are on the top,
none can take it any longer,
wilder than defined "anarchy".
"You cops, stay away!
We are kings of own neighbourhood,
to protect and to kill!"

Blood is spilled on the ground,
body laid down in weakness.
They won't hear his pleading
when they pour the gasoline.
Paid in full for a little crime,
man, he's been kicked and beaten.
No more chance to escape,
just wait for his last breath.
Burn! Die!

Worse than the animal,
evil is the nature of man.
Driven by sadistic plans of action,
can we save ourselves?
There is no one righteous, not even one...
what should we do to take away
all these monsters within?You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groanThe flame is burning
and shadows comes to life,
with a simple flick of the light
their movements change;

And sanding away the light source
the shadows grows longer,
and eager for a new life
they stretch and cry.

Projections exactly like
memories kept in mind,
shadows are reflections
of ourselves in presence of light...(solo)

HE NEVER WON ANY BATTLE 
AND HIS LIES PROVE HE ALREADY LOST THE WAR(Instrumental)(Narration)

Lost in the gleaming hue of timeless war where the twilight slain glisten in the shimmering waves of blood.
The spirits of murder are clothed in ash awaiting the wind of evermore to disperse their hollow form.

I see the voices of peace wailing amongst an all-consuming hatred,
I hear the images of skinless shadows lamenting from the embers of reeking human remains.

Behold the withering delirium of harrowing slaughter burning in an eastern blaze.
Nightmares arise from stillborn dreams to decay in a pestilential tempest of Mesopotamian graves.
God live forever
But we do not(Instrumental)Take a message to my father
Tell him I have returned
That I now embrace this lonely place
And the family I spurned
I have lived a life of sin
Debauched and decadent
This filth I've wallowed in
Has left me cold and unrepentant

I crossed the line between pleasure and crime
A modern-day De Sade
I chose the way of Gilles de Rais
And the enemies of god
I'm your greatest failure
Nothing can save me
Prodigal Son of the Evil One
I am what you made me

Say a prayer to your ugly god
For the souls of children offered up
We drank their blood, we ate their flesh
And reveled in the sweet smell of excess

I will live forever
For I am truly blessed
My name will live in infamy
Synonymous with death
I'm your greatest failure
Nothing can save me
Prodigal Son of the Evil One
I am what you made meSolitude feeding on my brain
It hurts more and more
I hate everybody, I hate myself.
Prowling around city that I used to love
Runnin into people that I used to love
Now I want to destroy everything
And kill everybody.
I can hear my inner voice saying:
Cut this off and be yourself again.
My head is full of bad memories
I want to forget all
and think of the good ones. But a dead brain can't think of anything. Do I ever find myself?
I can hear my inner voice saying:
Stop this and be yourself again.
Solitude feeding on my brain
It hurts more and more.
My hatred to you!
My hatred to all!
Runnin into people that I used to love
Now I want to destroy everything
And kill everybody.(Instrumental)Listless Attique Spinsters Roost

Too late to see how weak is your faith
Longer I live
Deeper's your cult
Angry for selfish filth

You try to keep your face and cover your pain 
Is there humanity in you
You try to keep your face and cover your pain
And that's the weakest side in you

Crawling down here
You're chasing my flesh
No time to swear for your conviction
Harder I scream
Stronger's your lust
Degrade
The potency's the source

You try to...

Must be waiting here 
Until your hands have tied my life
WHY!
Must be waiting here 
Until your hands have tied my life

Standing right here I cover my face
Too late to see how weak is your faith
Longer I live
Deeper's your cult
Angry for selfish filth

You try to...

There's only hatred in a world
Where you're living your life
And Nothing seems to be Realistic in your mind
WHY!
Must be waiting here 
Until your hands have tied my life(Instrumental)(Instrumental)A little child and unspoken words
His dream was too deep in dirt
The only thing what he wanted to see
Was a tale that they should not hear
The colours of the sky turn black
Why to ask there's nothing to know
Happiness - Forever - It's gone
I'll tell you why you stained my heart

They expected I take them as God
In the hands, on the weakest arms
Building their future into my head
To be the master of my dying self

The soul of rape through the darkness
I can feel all their hatred
Feed your growing pain inside me
Can you stand all this torture

Never slept too long and deep
Before the dawn his screams begun
Why to stand beyond my shadow
I try to reach the truth of love

The soul of rape through the darkness
I can feel all their hatred
Feed your growing pain inside me
Can you stand all this torture

The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to make them fall
The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to get some more

The promises are burning deep in my thoughts
The colors of the lost became clearly back
I believe in time I have to forget
It's a lie, I can make you sure

The soul of rape through the darkness
I can feel all their hatred
Feed your growing pain inside me
Can you stand all this torture

Empty fields, one by one
I can't escape the smell of bones
Stripping happy with naked bodies
Rage is all what I could ever seeWorld domination... NOW!

Are you listening to me?
Can you even hear my words?
I'm trying to tell you that history
Is being written in reverse

If the writing on the wall is the Trenchcoat Mafia
Destroy the world that has nothing left to offer you
Become the monster that the media has made of you
Reclaim the world and all that it has taken from you

A masterplan, a final solution for a...
New Satanic revolution
One world, a single nation
Undivided under Satan

You raped our souls
and then you said "Get used to it!"
You'll get what's coming to you
You filthy hypocrites
Fuck you and your tired dogma
Fuck you and your world of shit
I have seen the future
AND WE ARE IT!

One world, a single nation
Undivided under Satan

I'm a high tension wire that's ready to snap and
I'm a walking hate crime ready to happen
We're the hands of death, the Invisible Empire
The strike force for the gods of hellfire
One world, a single nation
Undivided under Satan
We will settle for nothing less than
Complete world domination(Instrumental)An iron point penetrates
And crushes the cervical vitabrae
The entire neck is forced forward
The trachea being crushed against the collar
The spike at the back
Guarantees prolonged agony
Apart from suffocation
Destruction of the spinal column
Locked around the swollen neck
You are chained to a dungeon wall
In a hall we prepare you
For your slow death by the punishment collar
No warmth or clean air
Rotting and smelling cadavers
Vermins in your food
And maggots in your water
In the meantime you get befouled
By your own and others excrements
In which you are lying in
Shit upon your skin
The flesh of neck, shoulders and jaw
Wears away, down to the bone,
Gangrene spreads
Fever acompanies contamination
From the festering wounds, eventually
Bones erode(Instrumental)Confusion in her eyes that says it all.
She's lost control.
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,
She's lost control.
And she gave away the secrets of her past,
And said I've lost control again,
And of a voice that told her when and where to act,
She said I've lost control again.

And she turned around and took me by the hand
And said I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again.
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

Well I had to phone her friend to state my case,
And say she's lost control again.
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,
And said I've lost control again.
But she expressed herself in many different ways,
Until she lost control again.
And walked upon the edge of no escape,
And laughed I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.

I could live a little better with the myths and the lies,
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried.
I could live a little in a wider line,
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone,
To lose control. When here we come.(Instrumental)IF GOD WERE YOUR FATHER
YOU WOULD LOVE ME
FOR I PROCEDED FORTH 
AND CAME FROM GOD
NEITHER CAME I OF MYSELF 
BUT HE SENT ME
WHY DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND 
MY SPEECH?  
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T 
HEAR MY WORD
YOU ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL
AND THE LUSTS OF YOUR FATHER
YOU SHALL DO
HE WAS A MURDERER 
FROM THE BEGINNING
AND ABODE NOT IN THE TRUTH
THERE IS NO TRUTH IN HIM
WHEN HE SPEAKS A LIE
HE SPEAKS HIS OWN
FOR HE IS A LIAR
AND FATHER OF IT
AND BECAUSE I TELL YOU THE TRUTH
YOU BELIEVE ME NOT
WHICH OF YOU 
CONVINCE ME OF SIN?
AND IF I SAY THE TRUTH 
WHY DO YOU NOT BELIEVE?
HE THAT IS OF GOD 
HEARS GOD'S WORDS
YOU THEREFORE HEAR THEM NOT
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT OF GOD
"SAY WE NOT WELL 
THAT YOU ARE A SAMARITAN
AND HAVE A DEVIL?"
I HAVE NOT A DEVIL 
BUT HONOUR MY FATHER
AND YOU DISHONOUR ME
I SEEK NOT MY OWN GLORY
THERE IS ONE THAT SEEKS AND JUDGES
"NOW WE KNOW, YOU HAVE A DEVIL
ABRAHAM IS DEAD, AND THE PROPHETS
AND YOU SAY 'IF A MAN KEEP MY SAYING
HE SHALL NEVER TASTE OF DEATH'"
"ARE YOU GREATER THAN OUR FATHER ABRAHAM
WHO IS DEAD? AND THE PROPHETS ARE DEAD
WHOM MAKEST THOU THYSELF?"
IF I HONOUR MYSELF
MY HONOUR IS NOTHING
IT IS MY FATHER 
WHO HONOURS ME

Plagiarized perception

But my heart is still beating!
I'm not a stain to wash up!

Just a dreg of society but I am a man
Who can change the rules of world?
No one because we are lost!

Day by day I give up of a better world,
I don't know where I find the strength to go on!

GROWS the rage inside mind

BURNS the flame of fear
Everybody know that we are lost but no one care of our tears

We are lost
Damned for what?
We are lost

WHAT we had done?
WHAT we will do?
Our fate is mad, cause our life is a game of death!

DUMB for sorrow!
DUMB for the pain!
We are face to face with our fearfull destiny!

We are lost
Damned for what?

The sun is rising around the plane.Looking to the dark and ancient age
when the fog of hate arise against the rotten world
Grown the flame of discord in the land of supreme evil
greed of the human race woke the abomination
a spirit in flames crawling towards his throne
claiming the dark ring was switched

the scourge of the earth has begun
invoking legions of death
March towards annihilation
burning and maiming human torment
rotting corpses piled
The world becomes a pit

Black magic prevails now
The forests are converted instead of a dark cult of death
where poison nest in the three roots
rivers and seas are dried, still life prevails
is the time of torment and death made flesh
The nekromancer !!!

The nekromancer reign has begun
Nobody can escape to this mummification
Towards made of bones
hearts are rotten to the wargs hordes
All hails the nekromancer !!!!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Shimmering orphan orbs

Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate

You're heavenly children
You raised to be week as you
Brain washed Christians
In the bible they live
My hate against your children
Is what i live for
To give them misery
That's what i am here for

I breed hate
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate

The light will soon be dead
Darkness prevails
Fire walk this way
The armies of hate
God won't save you now
No answer you get
Your prayers a waste of time
Heaven is dead

Now i bring down god
With sin after sin
Dismember his children
Killing all of his love
My armies of hatred
Will forever stand tall
I breed hate eternal hate

Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies

I breed hate
SufferClean ultramarine limpid skies
Above the head
Beholding the winter sunset with threat
as the blue eyes look at you from somewhere
You are like a mouse in (the) maze
as the blue eyes look at you from somewhere
ike a mouse in the maze of human shit.

No chance to survive

Shadows of the concrete human ant kills try to crush
your lost depressed spirit.
You are searching for salvation and
Hope will be your only friend

You are searching for salvation amongst the stigmas of sun blood on the white snow that drown in the shadows of the stone plates with every second of night approaching. Your desperate gaze catches the peaks of buildings that aren't eaten by shadows yet. Only there you can be alone with the sun. Entering the concrete hive you'll see the synthetic light replacing the real one, you'll see the thousands of useless blessings. You'll get to know the people with souls like stinking dirty corridors.

And the last door is closer
now the last door is in front of
you, just one step and you are out of the dead light.
And the wind that blows your hair, there are the first
first tears in the eyes of the frozen sky.
It won't forgive you your mistakes.
Beat your knees in blood to beg for life
One more everlasting moments and
The horizon hid the sun again.surrounded by glass, one must not throw stones, for this communion binds us as we are blind and contempt for the feeding. shrine of moria, empathy for those who cannot see, shrine of moria, empathy for those who cannot see. a battle for scripture and faith ensues, these are the lost gospels buried again, these are the words orf christ.  buried again, these are the lost gospels, the faiths we never knew,  shrine of moria, empathy for those who cannot see,  shrine of moria, empathy for those who cannot see, a battle for scripture and faith ensues, these are the lost gospels buried again, these are the words orf christ.  buried again, these are the lost gospels, the faiths we never knewAn archaic wind is caressing our pale age
Storms of buried truths
The unseemly tale of a legal lie
The leaking existence of a material life

The nihilistic way
Tears apart the house of their god
Immolation in sin
Reward through panic lust

Defecating on their modern believes
Worshippers of a moral cage
Falling from futile salvation
Skies tremble in fear

Breaking the chains of morality
Seduced by a pagan whisper
The triptycon of lies crumbles
In the name of the forgotten vision

Truth is unveiled
Day of man is at hand
Pagan seducer
Shelter in a bath of sin

The tomb of Christianity forever sealed
The lies of a tyrannic age forgotten and laid to rest
 
Blood is spilled
From the altar of the dying cross
Pagan blessings
Relentless rise of spirit untamedYou make us nauseous,
You make the flowers sick,
You make the feline furless.
Your blindness makes us seep through the ground.

In heritage of years of speechless congregations we've grown into inhuman resistance.
We've blindsided what should have killed us and subverted the prophecy into sorcery.

They can kill our body; the antichrist, but they can never kill our thoughts.
Through illuminations of menstrual blood, godly semen and pediatric urine, we've dispersed the alpha wolves of guilt.
What is missing?

Understand your purpose and focus on your strengths.
You are here to inspire humans to conjure dragons.
Because conjuring is forever, it is timeless; not listening to what others might say will make it easier.
There lies a path beyond every thought conjured, and it is the snakes purpose to slither it complete.
These conjurations lead the way to the blackest of flames or whitest of lights.

It is another matter of disparity, death and life.
Dying is as relative as time.

The smoke inhaled from the burning of the stupid book of the prophecy of certainty into sorcery of chaos shall slowly set our spirits beyond.
Living is the dark hours of a day.
During said dark hours you might get advantage from the ease of walking through celestial valleys slithered open before you, and do not let the shame of being one of those fail you.
Falling away into the sky is an impossible movement, but conjuring is forever.
So here I conjure the thought of you teaching me how to live, when death is so near for you.

How more arrogant can one be, than to tell one how to live?
Because arrogance is the essence of slithery intention!
And know that slithering is the only way to fall away into the sky.

As our phosphorous souls nurture the black eyes of a dragon.
Arrogance is the essence of slithery intention.
Let it wash your soul, but not your being.
Or let your soul devour your meaning...
In this land of cause, you must use cause.
Manipulate the meaning Your will shattered 
Like an egg beneath my feet 
Your nature to obey 
Marked as a follower 
You accomplish nothing 
Too blind to see the way 
You are as sand 
As the wind blows 

You cling to it 
Your faith as your shield 
Against the perils 
Of this world 
But blind you cannot see 
Hidden by this guise of faith 
An ultimately superior 
Reality! 

Solo: Macey 

My will - crushes your will 
Our will - sends 
Tidal waves of fear 
Throughout your mundane empire 
Unseen we reign supreme 
We stand ignored with sight 
In your kingdom of the blind 

A breed of men apart 
We are the ones who shape our lives 
We tread our way 
Along these paths seldom trodden. 

Outro Solo: Macey(Instrumental)Only the pure can see the Holy grail.
And the grace begged, wasted if withheld from the unwell.
The unwell lift the window.
Sorcerer, speak the Secret Lexicon out loud.

Unveiler, Revealer.
Sisters, brothers.
Giver & Receiver.

The old days. Penance, fire & brimstone.
If the end time is our time after all.

The ecstasy's real.Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the lovin' things
Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh, baby, hold tight
Oh, she said,

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the lovin' things

Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight
Oh, she said,

Any way you want it
She said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want itWe are all slaves
Digging our own graves
In church yards while the priests
Cast judgment on our beliefs

Because Christ laid down his hands and feet
So I would always fall asleep
And in this slumber suffocate
On the dirt suppressing my lungs

I'm not dead yet
I'm just trying to wake up

I'm not dead yet
I'm just trying to wake up

The gun is perched between my teeth
The cold metallic taste on my lips
Lets me go free
Lets me go free

The gun is perched between my teeth
The bullet is lodged inside of me
I go free
I go free

You turn back your eyes
There is nothing but silence
We dream of this moment all the time
It's simply a naked califaction

And it distracts our minds
From the fundamental meaning of life
That we are nothing
That we are all victims of suicide

But we are not dead yet
We are just trying to wake up

But I'm not dead yet
I'm just trying to find my gun

The gun is perched between my teeth
The cold metallic taste on my lips
Lets me go free
Lets me go free

The gun is perched between my teeth
The bullet is lodged inside of me
I go free
I go free

I know I am alive
By realizing that I am dead inside
I scream at the top of my lungs
My senses acknowledge I am alive

But I continue to drown in the emptiness
Brought by a mundane and sensuous feeling
That my sadness translates
Into transcendenceGods from planet Nubir
created the human race.
Aliens are the gods who
made the first people on earth.

Who's god, where is truth?
Use your brain, open your eyes.

All ages in the black darkness,
without the light of knowledge,
under the holy pressure and
inside the deep gorge of lies.
Why to keep hold of wrong theses
like the suckling of mum's breast.
We can look into our long history
and admit the proofs of archeology.
Listen and read the about the the new
research about our planet.

Who created the pyramids?
Who created the world?

Try to enlighten the cave of darkness
and to set free from the chains of ignorance
How could people know so good
a geometry and maths a thousand
years before Pythagoras?
Also the chronicles of Sumer shows
old reality.They're tearing the pieces of my mind
They fake and surely can't leave us
Technology understands
Who pulls the strings of sinking Earth
My pride cannot stand another fail
Nomore mistakes to complain
Quite face looking down

Once we dreamed of something new
Now this all is wasting us
Shattered figures roaming on
The innerself of the system

Scared to belive existance
You cannot choose what will remain
Can't keep these thoughts
They took away
You need a tool for apathy

Somewhere you hear the ancient whisper
When they Lies Wrote Mysteries
Somewhere you hear the ancient whisper
When they Lies Wrote Mysteries

They're assuring to make all this better
How much to take only empty promises
Within-Whitout 
They're pulling fast 
Not much to forsee

Scared to belive...verse:
Don't you have, those blackened nights where shadows arise
His coined eye, pierced in your back, in his clincher lab
The sleeping nightmare, it sleeps no longer, thoughts make it stronger
You try to run, naked in the dark, a lifetime scar

refrain:
It's the purity of a dream, which felt so real
To me, it's a scream, a scream of death
Try to resist, in this dishonest fight
But it's a rape of your vulnerable mind!

bridge:
Wake up, in anxiety, hallowed for an eternity
Shivering, your bloodline, waiting till et's time to die
Burning, in infinity, screaming so vividly
The dream, of living on, the purity of a blackened dawn

verse:
Don't you hear, the imposters call, he's waiting for your fall
In the ending lies Satan's code, on the dead-end road
Battle cry through flesh and bone, you and me alone
A trace of blood and savage mind, don't get behind

refrain:
It's the purity of a dream, which felt so real
To me, it's a scream, a scream of death
Try to resist, in this dishonest fight
But it's a rape of your vulnerable mind!Like a horde of maddened bees
Swarm like locusts, spreading disease
An infectious sea
Swarming over you
Swarming over me

Suffering
Death
A swarm so thick you can't breathe

Ain't life grand?

This is now the dreaded day you thought would never come 
You have got no other place to hide 
I'm about to freak you out and blow your mind 
Believe me, your life changes tonight 

Everything you think you know, I'm throwing out the door 
Opening your eyes to something new 
You're not who you think you are, It's time you figured out 
But then again I think you always knew 
I'm not saying anything you don't already know 

Cut yourself open and see and see - and see 
My blood runs through your veins, We are one and the same 

So get yourself up on your feet 
And stake your claim to rights 
All the world is in your hands tonight 
Break the fear and break the chains 
That wrap around your counted days 
To find the will to break away 
And I'm not saying anything you don't already know(Instrumental)Flaring howls darkening the sky
Disaster patiently awaiting to ignite
The skies can no longer hold their cry
They're preparing to release the heavy blight

Armies of tears start rushing down
With the fixed thought to drown
Set to steal the might of crown
replacing it with bludgeoned frown

I fall silently amongst the others
Unnamed drops that stir the waters
For now I'm a tear of untainted matter
Flawless offspring of the unmatched weather

The fall is fast, the end is nigh
These burdened stills embrace my flight
The crash unveils the loss of sight
Buried I am beneath the watering delight
Tasting the peace of a river's inside

They come fleeing the land
where no one smiles,
Their dreams, illusions, lives,
and reality are left behind,
destiny is dark;
they long to live just one more day.

[Bridge]
Pain and vengeance take
them drifting through and endless road.
Indifference is cruel and sad it
Can't go on.

[Chorus:]
Tearing their clothes they go on
led by a road to a land of dead
Losing is dying ;
winning is keeping alive to be free.

They reach a land where they
hope to survive;
a new life is to begin,
dreams fade away
chilling cold displays
Misery and waekness.

Losing is dying ;
winning is keeping alive to be free.

Weird pain, dark lair
Silent grave, aimless name

You will know who you are
Down in your fears
Down in your dreams
You will get answer for
When does it begin
Where is the end
You will see Marduk's race
And worshippers of the Ancient Ones
You will find the outer space
The outer space will find ya

Ride through the defunct domain
Find abomination's name
Raise your eyes above the Dead
Cry, your lament can't be heard

It breeds more horror than you can conceive
And number of hordes uncounted is
Wanderers of the Wastelands dwell

In the end your soul will rise up from underneath the caverns of death...
This is true... For my savior said that by His life, we are given a choice...
Come...

Your soul will rise up from underneath the cavern of death!

Nothing, barely pinch of ash
But hesr my sigh
I'm craving for freedom calls
Freedom calls
Fear's controling you
Tears flow drop by drop
Raise your head and arm yourself
You are strong enough
In your anger find the strenght
Don't talk start to ace
Look it is your life
Try to change it, fight
Burst your feters, restrain your pain
My voice is freedom call
So hear it
Get up raise head
Arm yourself
Overcome your fear
Kill your wrath
Take that yours it is
Fight do not retreatA Demigod never feel the sword's blade
Sons of Hades, centurions and barbarians
In the forests and for the crowns battles will be joined
Blood, fire and steel, this is my alchemy

Rise your bloody flag!
Pazuzu drinks us with his glimmer

My honor will be satisfied with your entrails !
Where bonfires heat up my dagger

Today we will celebrate the Nature's Spirits
The valiant warriors rest in the dark forests' glades

Believe, don't cross my destiny !
Pazuzu drinks us with his glimmer

My honor will be satisfied with your entrails !
Where bonfires heat up my dagger

A Demigod never feel the sword's blade
Sons of Hades, centurions and barbarians
In the forests and for the crowns battles will be joined
Blood, fire and steel, this is my alchemyMoiling spectral hollow
Dour of revolute procession

And I have a palette of dreams to paint your face.
To paint those memories I have of you,
The way your are in my thoughts

A different way of living, of being as one.
Not like the way we used to be.
The burning Sun is on my back again,
And its time to face it's light.

Those memories I have of you are twisted by time.
And that very way I used to be, is now just a memory.

Orphaned dreams I have of you,
I've grown tired of their flaws.
Your colours are all tainted,
And time has moved on your tired face.

A different way of living, of being as one.
Not like the way we used to be.Process to scan lines and monitor absinthe
Complicated knots, autonomic still
Amplifying delusion
Into my absolute stagnation

Combing selectively with informed amnesia
Deflated independence, sigh to growl
Scan lines etch a digital time killer
Mind sweeping aperture, clues me out
Viciously passive, in the shellac of routine
As the spokes address

Voice over dubbed in, numb existence key
Mirror image, that's never really free"Hey, I've been thinking about us lately, and I think I need to talk to you later. Bye!"

"Hey, like I said earlier, I've been thinking about us lately, and I need to ask you something."

"The number you have reached, 9-1-1, has been changed to a non-published number"Lucifer is one of the greatest eyes to the shadow side of spirits. I am one who believes that it is the highest spiritual chaos. I want that chaos to wash through my being with uncertain beauty, of everlastingness. God and its image is of a school president, I was and will never be respectful or grateful to it. Such arrogant boredom, I despise all that they think that they stand for. But more so the conformist pieces of shit that may or may not try to walk his so called path. I find peace in raping and getting raped by beauty and abomination. I find beauty in my ugliness and vice versa. I like honesty more than anything, and no light is darker than truth. Bring me that light wherever I go oh lord of the night.Amidst the frequent efforts of remembering
Amidst the stubborn pains of gathering the objects odd
Amidst the state of seeming things unparalleled
Success appeared absolute, inconceivable

Sparkling with inner light of supreme truth

Unreal remembrance says indistinctly about
Unreal tall figures picked me up, silent, carried down
Until it took my breath away, unreal
From the descending infinity itself out of mind

Time was stopped
Swampy terrible emptiness
It widens inside me more and more
Place is released for it
More and more and it seems
That soon thin cover will remain from my body
Covering that endless
Sinister emptiness
And that hopeless nothing

Amidst the frequent efforts of remembering
Amidst the stubborn pains of gathering the objects odd
Amidst the state of seeming things unparalleled

The people are just sheep coralled by their keepers
Torn apart, ripped in two
Straight thru the center & both sides lose
All is lost, just chipped away
I guess constant change is here to stay

Stuck in a corner of my world
Still lost from times ago
I've planted everything I've ever known
Just to watch none of it grow
Torn apart, ripped in two
Straight thru the center, both sides lose
All is lost, just chipped away
I guess constant change is here to stay

Still talkin' to my shadows
Once again just like before
Just like me, the shadows agree
I've been drenched in spite and
Doused in negativity

Separated further, separate it

Beaten in the back of the head
Just keep on drivin'... drivin' the wedge

Further separated, further I separate it

Rivers of pious fluids through the perished land
The land of the matter, not here to stay

Torch these dying embers
Fulfill this empty vessel of mine
Wash my eyes to see

Martyr just for me(Psalm 102:6, 8, 11-14) 

I am like a desert owl,
Like an owl among the ruins...
All day long my enemies taunt me.
Those who rail against me use my name as a curse.
My days are like the evening shadow...
I wither away like grass...

But You, O Lord, sit enthroned forever...
Your renown endures through all generations...
You will arise and have compassion on Zion,
For it is time to show favor to her...
The appointed time has come...Abandoned the man who I was 
the future form cannot be conceived 
the existence I lead, lifeless purgatory. 

Blissful self violence is my wretched legacy. 

Infinite equations of futile connections 
coronal sunbeams pierce my mind 
two parts of a whole; a torturous fracture 
joined by a charge; design of a radiant mind. 

The fire that burns outlined abstractions 
faces of light forever burned 
to the back of my eyes. 
Face down you recognize 
the fleeting chance to dream. 

Only this fatal dose and half-written letter remain, 
the punchline to my last joke told with a shuffling thud. 
Tasting the end of forever 
the answer to my problem is a dropping pulse. 

Consumed in disappointment, 
chagrin befell my eyes. 
wandering in lust wearing tattered clothes 
violently shaking in spiritual seizure. 
Apathy is my companion 
in this constant state of suspension 
A lifeless retreat, in a cave of despair. 
I found words of peace, in this wonderful stillness.(Instrumental)Caught in a fuck storm

VIP AREA[x3]I'm standing in a breeze at the dawn of a new age
awaiting aquarius to come.
Waiting to open our shells to swim to a new existence.

How real is this lucid dream to us?
With all its tragic failures inside.

And if we survive the coming twenty years of chaos?
Can we ever walk the landscape we've painted to beautiful and nice?

Didn't we want the best for us all?
Can someone give me the answers?
To the questions I've been searching for

while the outside world looks almighty
a new world slips in silently

let's start a journey through our pre-historical past
to find out how it come, what it is and what it will be

beware......................................(Instrumental)What was the catalyst, the final offense, that forced her presence 
To intervene, to make known, this planet of stone, is truly her bone 

And her flesh, ripples with troughs and crests 
And our lakes, are her breasts 
And her veins, quench our thirsts 
But we pour our filth in first 

Our judgment came not in flame, but in flood 
A crawling lake of brine, thick with oil, thick with blood 

Beg for, forgiveness from higher ground 

Scents of cetacean serpents carried for miles 
One baleen grin hides another serrated smile 

When, pectoral fins block out the sun, all is lost 

For those out of her reach, she'll swell rivers into the creeks, 
Pushing creeks into the streams, until the highest lakes boil and teem 

Torrential flows carving pinnacles clean 
We are debris from which god's hands filter feed 

When new shores lap at our highest peeks 
The world as we know it will flow past their teeth(Instrumental)anger, violence and death 
work, exhaustion and death 
anguish, suicide and death 
evil, murder and death 
our minds turn straight to division 
as logic fades itself toward oblivion 
pain sent to elevate bitterness 
do we love it more than a blunt statement? 
dream, desire and life 
faith, endurance and life 
hope, ambition and life 
love, devotion and life 
kill the thoughts you are trying to shift 
outside perimeter of synthetic conscience 
grasp a very motion from devoid intellect 
drift and fluctuate as truth was never explored 
tragedy brings apathy to ignorance 
like street lights beaming on empty avenues 
cognizance withstands the swarm of suffering 
as it never forgives, and it never forgets 
a mouthful of godforsaken emptiness 
formed featureless shapes among dead clouds 
i was amazed at the staircase leading nowhere 
but it drives dividend on a poor soul of mine 

[september 2012 - february 2013](Instrumental)Prowling over wires, 
Petrified silicon, and mortar 
Skirting kinsmen with their monuments and emblems 

Openings structured by sparks, flies, and dust 
Relieving garrulous tribes of their honour - 
Their entrails of self-worth 

Approaching by way of driplines 
Drawn by viscera 
Throbbing dendritic formations 
Carry my sorrow 

Discerning viscous mucous - 
Remnants of the past 
Adapting as did the edaphobites 
To the cave's erosion 

Galleries deep underground 
Will adorn my being 
Tower karsts converge to cradle 
The cavity's core 

Underneath my feet 
The hidden dark zone 
Compelled to retreat 
All the wires part 

In the center of this remote cave 
I arise as venom from springs 

Galleries deep underground 
Will adorn my being 
Tower carsts converge to cradle 
The cavity's core 

These notions dead and meek 
Past the lower boulder choke 
Entombed by cunning weakness 
Accessed by morbid lore 

In the center of this remote cave 
I flow upon vermiculations 

In this remote cave 
In this remote cave 
In this remote cave 
In this remote caveSeven doors
Not one leading to heaven
Snakes and nightmares
All in pacts of seven
Dungeons of filth
Make you wish the death is the end
Corrosion of souls
Will and spirit bent

Sorrows in dark gloom
Bleed for the haunting past
Despair terminates
Hopes shattered like glass
Oblivion your final adress
No savior no return
Death and terror your doom
Forever you shall burn(Instrumental)We are the voice of exemption
The filth of mother's creation
Result of someone's adiction
The profit of your exploitation

The damage of your generation
Reborn of fail misconception
Mechanic insemination
Geneticly build for corruption

The vengeance runs in my veins
I'm not the only one
I'll never hang my head in shame
My heart has just become
Your criminal

We are the virus inception
The sicknes infecting the nation
The thieves of your fake posessions
The rapists of all your obsessions

Attacking the ways of protection
The fear that controlls your intentions
Poetic elimination
Forsaking the sins in our actionsFinding truth in lies, reading between the lines.
See through deceptions, sense through periphery.
An intrinsic macrocosm, essential and constitutive,
entirely in totality.
Gestalt principles of matter perception.

A multitude of perceptive decay.
Reasons interact within acceptance,
built into somatic habit and regularity.
Unquestionable yet undecidable.The pass in silence, under light of moon, 
Ancient arriors sorrowful and grey 
In never-fading shame, yet no cries are heard 
Silently they pass 
Their one-eyed god is watching, 
As they pass thorugh endless forests 
They came as earriors from the north, 
To claim our shores their own 
Enshrouded in lace mist, 
Shileds and armour earth stained 
The blood of their wounds 
Still as crimson as the day it flowed 
They are the norse men that failed, 
Lost to time forever 
Their thirst for war as they came 
Was unquenched at their failure 
When their dragons burned on our shores, 
They werw condamned to sleep 
Beneath our starlit heavens...

Changing with the seasons
Unprepared for the day the sun comes
Defenses twist with the coming of Spring
New life rises up
Inside I am freezing
Even until the August swelter

Goodbye mother, goodbye father
I vanish into the Winter

Forced to smile for appearances
A lie to prevent intrusion
Autumn's beauty lingers in my past
Memories coming back
Life's colors darken as I reflect
The sun's departure

Goodbye mother, goodbye father
I vanish into the Winter

Didn't I deserve better than this?

My thoughts race, perverse is my intent
Winter's cold heart shall I now embrace
Pleasure & pain are now one and the same
A time that is past is not forgotten

Goodbye mother, goodbye father
I vanish into the WinterShe was only 82 years old

She went down like a rag dollThe diabolic codex - this ancient tome
A host of shadows - all call their home
These pages glow - with an eerie light
The cold black flame - of the endless night
The true grimoire - of dark technology
Past, present, and future - of demonology
We dare to tread - where no man should
We have read the book - that's wired in blood

Wired... in blood   Wired... in blood
Wired... in blood   Behold the Electronomicon

Wired... in blood   Wired... in blood
Wired... in blood   Behold the Electronomicon

No mortal man - has lived to tell
That which is revealed - in this electric hell
The pact is made - the circuit thrown
The files are filed - the truth is known
Forbidden knowledge - that it contains
Of dark ones called - by 44 names
We choose damnation - it's understood
That we belong to the book that's wired in blood

Wired... in blood   Wired... in blood
Wired... in blood   Behold the Electronomicon

Wired... in blood   Wired... in blood
Wired... in blood   Behold the Electronomicon

We know the score... and the digital devils all kill by
numbers in the dark dominion of the spell we're under

22... voices are calling you - 33... less purity
44... blood forevermore - 88... open the gate!

13... forever unseen - 23... your curiosity
32... on too few - 43... never to be

66... dirty tricks - 11... fell from heaven!

14... unclean - 27... imperfection
69... pain divine - 44... shut the door!

The secrets of the world - are written in the book
With the power of the millions - of souls it took
Demonic data - ritual programs
Bestow these powers - on those who know them
The pact is made - the circuit thrown
The files are filed - the truth is known

Wired... in blood   Behold the ElectronomiconHello, my dear old friend, come on in 
Would you care for a glass of gin? 
I haven't seen you for a while 
And all I want is just a smile

I wonder how you can't recall 
The damage that you've done to 
all You stole our hopes, 
created pain Now your time's here to taste my chain

This is the last time we would meet 
Come on now, come, please take a seat 
It won't take long, I must withdraw 
Excuse me while I get my saw 
You can't expect me to forget 
I wonder if you feel regret 
As nothing's left you could repair 
I welcome you to your nightmare 

My chainsaw roaring like a bear 
The screams of horror fill the air

As all my walls turn scarlet red 
As last piece I cut off the head 
Suddenly your veins appear 
your skull is now my souvenir

The deed is done, my work fulfilled 
You were the last one I have killed 
Now all the parts left to arrange 
And here and there a little change 
My chainsaw puzzle's taking shape 
It's more than some of you could cape 
I hear the sirens from afar 
While I create an art bizarreI can't afford to live
I can't afford to take my chance
Looking at the ways
They're telling me to live in fear

To give it all again
I gave it all for nothing, yeah
Celebrate the truth
At least I fought to get us here

If anyone should ask
How the story goes
Just pretend we're almost there
Just pretend, pretend

Holding on for life
Holding on for one reason
Looking at the ways
Returning me for one last time

Celebrate the truth
At least I fought to get us here

If anyone should ask
How the story goes
Just pretend we're almost there
Just pretend
And when the wreckage breaks
We'll fall into below
Just pretend it's safe and warm
Just pretend, pretendIts facial features, hair and skin
I deeply breathe and recall
Its voice is low its eyes are mute 
My mind is slaughtered with yearning

A figure so frail and caprice
is stirring hot coals on my head
I'm headed its way slightly drunk
towards an end that's already known

The way the light shines from its face
A lonely lamp in the dark
I breathe the pace of its beating heart
A disappointing account

A figure so frail and caprice 
is stirring hot coals on my head
I'm headed its way slightly drunk 
towards an end that's already known

I try to breathe only by my heart
I drive it out of my head
My summer nights will pass all alone
In the coming Spring I'll be fine

A figure so frail and caprice
is stirring hot coals on my head
I'm headed its way slightly drunk
towards an end that's already known
I shake off the dream and wake up
to begin another day
Facing a figure in the darkAlright, we're doin' another cover here. I forget who's it by, 'cause it's pretty gay, but we're gonna make it awesome possum! Anyway, here we go.

1, 2, ready, go!

Don't you make my...

I messed up...(Instrumental)Crumbling and inarticulate
Stalled with lassitude
The spiders of weariness upon me
Nothing to cleanse the poisoned element
Flashing and yearning
Suffering and identification
The enigma of survival
A call heard within sleep
Cold copulars embraceYou're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around, refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, 'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall

Can't complain, I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, 'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

Look this way, just a little smile, is what they say
You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay!!

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, 'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around, refugeeThis life you live is nothing but a sexually transmitted disease.
Materialistic hunger breeds this filth of which you call life.A higher power under ground
From seraph skies and now to chaos bound
He is sitting sacred and profound
In midst of sinners licking up to kiss his crown

Pathetic humans in despair
Defaced, deflowered, now to death devout
A fallen angel in his glare
In midst of sinners kneeling down before his clout

Old one
Master
All beauty lies within
Old one
Master
All beauty lies within you

This oasis is a poisoned well
Of rotting carcasses that clog the deep
A prince in exile here in hell
In midst of sinners flocking up like soulless sheep

Old one
Master
All beauty lies within
Old one
Master
All beauty lies within you

Old one
Master
All beauty lies within
Satan
Master
All beauty lies within...

...your infernal majesty"Like a young boy is wondering why,
The reason for we live and die
I travelled on many seas,
Crying, on my wounded knees
I hold back, a real emotional hell
Enclosed in a so unreal shell
A pool of hate was where i dived in
Unused to come clear, but it wasn't my coffin
A human being helped me out and to get free,
With deepest respect, i love thee."
The quest of the truth of existence,
Is really without importance
During my childhood, i lost hope and faith
That wasn't a reason to give up or to resiliate
Time went on, and i found back life's odour
In the heart of a being, within splendour
Through time, i learned to love,
Things that are standing high above,
By being aware, by choosing another way
The importance of life and what is todayAnd the next song, boy, is real nice. We call it fancy. 

1, 2, ready, go.

Fancy!

That's fancy.I sit alone in a hazy room
Watching a fading flame
Everyone around me are now gone
Each one on their time
Insignificant for the world
Might be the way I wandered
The way that too early
Came to its end

Before the end of my journey
I had time to realize I lived
But I hadn't time to understand
Understand the meaning
I did a lot of things in my life
But however I did nothing
Now I hear the wind sings
A dirge in my memory

If my life is a mystery even to me
How anyone else could read it?
If I let my life go would I be free?
Let see and leave the life behind

When I look backward
I see an order in the chaos
Which build a flimsy bridge
On its end I see eyes of the child
And I stare them until I see myself
I stare until I drown into those eyes

In vain faded the life that left behind

When I look forward
I can't understand what I see
So I see nothing after nothing
Through that emptiness I will dive
Unknowing where I'm going
Blinded by my narrow consciousness(Instrumental)(Instrumental)you wont like the day i seek my revenge
burned torn flesh awaits your eyes
rise from your grave
prepare to meet your doom
ahhhhhhhhh
me and my chainsaw
the last thing you'll ever see1, 2, 3, Go!

Fun but illegal, don't care what I do
I've heard a voice in my head since when I was born
Fever - Burning deep in my soul
I'm not alone in my head - out of control

Higher! A little creature whispers words in my ears
I'm going higher with him hand in hand
There are no angels here tonight

Please forgive me father 'cause I have sinned -
I know. I did it again

Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Sorry it's not so bad you know?
Oh, oh let me go crazy!
Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Behind the mirror on my wall
Oh, oh without fear, the devil is inside of me -
is inside of me

Innocent joke, a moment in life
He's got the power of the woman you want
Art of sinner versus a saint
A road to my madhouse and here we go again

Only sin after sin. Yes i have sinned...I know. I did it again

Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Sorry it's not so bad you know?
Oh, oh let me go crazy!
Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Behind the mirror on my wall
Oh, oh without fear, the devil is inside of me -
is inside of me

There's something in him that feeds me
With his voice I found, one taste
With one taste I've found madness in me
I've found madness inside my head

Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Sorry it's not so bad you know?
Oh, oh let me go crazy!
Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Behind the mirror on my wall
Oh, oh without fear, the devil is inside of me -
is inside of meThe Light of the universe, the cosmic force of love
Creator of sun and moon, Ruler of heavenly hosts
sent his prince into the world to gather His race.
The human race has been enslaved by evil forces that rule
this dark world we live in. This ancient battle rages inside
our mind for our hearts. Casted down the fallen angels 
roam this planet. They now have become a parasite body snatcher
separating us from our home. They seek to take us with them 
into Hell.
Jesus came down down from His throne to redeem us from our sin..
By His blood we are healed resurrected from the dead.
The light of the universe, the cosmic force of love.
Creator of sun and moon, Ruler of heavenly hosts
sent his prince into the world to gather His race.
He died for us defeating dark forces, celestial conquest completed.The night is so cold, the moon shines bright
The winter is freezing the land
The wolf's whole land of hunger and cold
And the people in holes are seared
They huddle close around the warming fire
But the coldness is in their hearts

Suddenly the smoke takes form and shapes of faces 
shapes that everyone knows
Souls the shadow already has taken
In nights so moonlit like this
Screaming with fear, inspired by panic
Running out into the dark

Outside in the darkness, in the coldness
and the frost, the shadow is taking their souls
Souls frozen to death, lacerated by wolves 
Its women, its children or menI see the light - forever
Beneath the clouds - of anymore
Enslave by - cold heaven
I'm impure - 'cause I can't cry
Look in the garden - full of chains
Look out of the doors - of perception

This raising morning, kingdom desire,
In the ocean, I shade's in this,
The snow falls, the snow bleed,
Tide's turning, among my heart,
This shining river, site in the mountains
Breath and seduce, breath and seduce...(Instrumental)"Dark Dawn"

The midnight come near, the wind lift up,
Foliage rustling in the crowns of trees.
I lie in bed in room, so dark
And I wait, when the day light comes again.

Night sky is flooding by black clouds
Storm comes, the rain start to lash on windows
Lighting illuminate the walls of this dark room
Then strongly thunderstorm, about this is the fear bigger.

Dark Dawn ... The day light comes not
I go mad if I'm waiting the sunrise.
Dark Dawn ... The day light comes not
I go mad, ever I wait not for the sunrise.

... And then it comes, the beauty of day life
All around is so lightly, as I not ever been in this castle
I don't know who I am, in fact I don't know if I live
Am I DEAD ? Am I DREAMING ? But that's I don't LEARN !

Dark Dawn ... The day light comes not
I go mad if I'm waiting the sunrise.
Dark Dawn ... The day light comes not
I go mad, ever I wait not for the sunrise.

Morning comes, the sun is lifting over mountains
Birds are twittering in the crowns of trees
I lie in coffin in a buried bround on the graveyard
Finally I'm not in this terribly castle in that's I fear, so much ...

Dark Dawn ... The day light comes not
I go mad if I'm waiting the sunrise.
Dark Dawn ... The day light comes not
I go mad, ever I wait not for the sunrise.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Crushes the life of our enemies.
Crushes everyone who has gone.
Crushes everyone who did not believe.
Crushes everyone who turned away.

Ashes at every place we left.
Villages we have robbed.
We have conquered castles.
we have made the gods furious.

Long is the way to our Noor,
it was long away we sailed
And we're sailed across
The Northern Sea,
Far from home.

The Northern Stars lead us the way to our Noor.

Crushes the life of our enemies.
Crushes everyone who has gone.
Crushes everyone who did not believe.
Crushes everyone who turned away.

Long is the way to our Noor,
it was long away we sailed
And we're sailed across
The Northern Sea,
Far from home.

the moon is shining so bright, to show us the Harbor.
the morning sun leads us the way to our Noor.

Long is the way to our Noor,
it was long away we sailed
And we're sailed across
The Northern Sea,
Far from home.Into your eyes I've been gazing lately, O life
The gold I saw gleam in your night, O life
A golden bark I saw gleam on waters, Darkened
A sinking, drinking, blinking, golden bark, Reside
My heels reared aloft, my toes they've been hearkened

I the nimble and supple serpent and the lurking witch
Went to the Daiti river to draw water for Haoma
Receiving the vision of the rhyme I've been lusting all away
Three thousand years of pure menog then comes the first bull
To the rhythm of his whip and his abyss shall you dance and shall you cry
The snakes, ants and all flies whose instinct is to destroy

This can't be the speech of the words
Spoken words so unreal
And is the moon watching the black sun trough the clouds of cosmos
Unorthodox moments trough the atmosphere
Something that can't be told, or by the wall of unknown will we be divided

Invading thru the base of sky
Inflicting the bull with death and sorrow
The dying primordial man
From his seeds grew eve and adam

From deepest dream I've woke and plead
The world is deep, The world is deep

Deep profound eternity
Gazing calmly out on the sea
I will scourge you with scourge of God
Pierce through and rend your heart

Cruelest huntsman
Wearing deceased's robes
Seeking inside your brain
Torturing god, your final bliss

Pleading for mercy
No turning backs
Sadistic rites
Of graceful god

Water's melt from lava
The magnitude of oceans
Falling into great existence
When they self destruct
Crying, screaming for a hand

Circles, talismans
Bells, bells and wands

Surround with death
Blood to breathe
Unfermented juice of the grape 
Calling to drink

The endless void
My sea of wisdom

Decay
Grief
Consult the corpse
Walk thru the grave

Drink my soul back into you
Burnt inside out, see this pain
Hear, hear this moan of mine
Howling, mourning all myself

Of dusk
And demise
The woods
The lakes
Covered in my blood

Mutilated bodies
Leading
Leaping
Drowning
Laughing
Crying for help
Answers empty
Laying in my coffin
My wisdom
My sound and my presence
Emerged out of despairAngels cry, 
realizing earth is close to destruct. 
God's sigh, 
Disgrace taking place again showing that tolerance's face is faroff. 
GOD'S SIGH 
Angels cry, 
realizing earth is close to destruct. 
God's sigh, 
Disgrace taking place again showing that tolerance's face is faroff. 
You tell me that you wanna CHANGE THE WORLD 
That you wanna take ALL THE HURT 
Wake up from this DREAM MY FRIEND 
This society's too much bent, 
So long, to whatever it is that lies in conviction, 
So long, to whatever it is that surrounds me! 
You can take the first row, public in command? 
Those who do not know, cannot understand!! 
GOD'S SIGH 
Angels cry, realizing earth is close to destruct. 
God's sigh disgrace taking place again showing that this shit can't stop. STOP!! 
So long, to whatever it is that lies in conviction, 
So long, to whatever it is that surrounds me![Lyrics: - Coss]

Hear the chant Across the breeze Cloth of white Sons to believe All of them make their way To the place of mass Surround the haven await the time Chanting the words of power

Read from the book of black Believers kill to predict Sacrifice the one Dark ritual begun

Circle forms within the henge Stones loom with eerie silence High priest enters, a king to these Bring the one forth Release a call from under robes I hear the words foreign to me Here comes the one to be The teller of a prophecy

[Solo: - Macey]
[Solo: - White]
[Solo: - Macey]

See the dagger straight and true Only silence never a scream Under robes so thick they hide Never to know who did this deed Blood runs into the altar To tell of things to come Sacrifice predicts a tale A tale of a future king

[Solo: - Macey]It's only grief and pain, the ugliest disease
The hierophant is praying to the gallows
The only dread and grim and suddenly he freezes
The Great Redeemer, the future trap
The scars and promises, against the Seraphim
The blood is leaking like the time in history
Disgrace and sickness, a pleasure with no feel
A choice of death, a path to nil

And only shapes remain to defend them
Like a tale with never-ending end
A life with innocence, the only savior
The fearless hunter, the timeless trip
For those who felt, for every deceiver and martyr
I am here to justify the sins...
No one will follow the signs
This journey is just loneliness and fear

Aenaon
The Endless Bound
Aenaon
The Cosmic Sound

Wrapped in cocoon of mortal and endless oblivion
Only the flesh reminds the link
Scars of human emptiness
The angriness diverted into creed

Aenaon
The Endless Bound
Aenaon
The Cosmic Sound

I hear no will, I see no marks,
It's this journey that outlines my past
I am Nothing, I am Everything,
I am always more than I feel

Dragged in sin, former believers
Plague and wax shroud all the cells
The road of purity, the death
Cast in stone, future and nowhere
In the womb of gravid land
Gates of past, the flow of dimension
The fearless hunter, the timeless tripMy parents fucked my childhood
the system broke my freedom
Bad friends destroyed the confidence
False whores buried my love

All the desires are hopeless now
I feel there's really no escape
This bloody violent planet
Just showed its darker face

The religious are murderous
They infect with pure faith
Their wars have shatters the peace
And confused my clearheaded mind

The demons killed my brain
The devils sucked my soul

Mentors scared my culture
Politics brought the false
They all devastated humanity
And enthrone the bestiality

These dreamkillers
shattered my dreams
and damaged my freedom
I feel creepy in the lion's den
Anon I'll be eaten

The demons killed my brain
The devils sucked my soul
Angels crucified me
All gods sacrificed meI fight lost wars
see light fear sight
I open my mind
need flesh fear mine 

I open my mind
need flesh fear mine
I see their lies
feel sad these lies 

(I need light)

you can't have it both ways, go on and pick a side
who will stand by you, when the other dies

He was a real go getter, a magnificent dresser
A killer with the ladies, and a hell of a dancer
A trailer park prophet, and a Friday night fighter
He's a hit on Sunday morning, with the bride of the pastor

( all this town is buzzin',
can't you hear them say my name )

She was a go-go dancer, and a glorious dresser
A sexy little number, that little harlot's a cancer
Pistols and penance, he will die with his sins
20 paces and the honor of one
Was she even worth it, I ask you son?

YOU TOOK THE HAND OF A STRANGER
hope he loved you honey, I couldn't tell
YOU TOOK THE BED OF THAT STRANGER
see ya later boy, enjoy your time in hell
HE HAD HIS WAY WITH AN ANGEL
pretty little thing, oh my, how far you fell
HE HAD HIS WAY WITH AN ANGEL

YOU TOOK THE HAND OF A STRANGER
hope he loved you honey, I couldn't tell
YOU TOOK THE BED OF THAT STRANGER
see ya later boy, enjoy your time in hell
HE HAD HIS WAY WITH AN ANGEL
pretty little thing, oh my, how far you fell
YOU TOOK THE HAND OF A STRANGER

hilltop baby, appalachian queen
slide across the barroom floor, beautiful and lean
you can't have it both ways, go on and pick a side
who will stand by you, when the other diesWell this is our finest hour
It's the death rattle of flower power
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Take a little ride on the Black Bus

The Black Bus is gonna take us flying
On a one-way trip down the Devil's highway
Six hundred sixty-six miles
Damnation's back in style

We left our hearts in San Francisco
When the psychedelic sounds gave way to disco
We traded flowers for knives
We got the Fear and it changed our lives
We hit the road back in '68
When the Summer of Love became the Summer of Hate
They all tried to warn us
About the place called Hotel California
A black church with a Black Pope
Preaching the gospel of Satan's hope
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Take a little ride on the Black Bus

The Black Bus is gonna take us flying
On a one-way trip down the Devil's highway
Six hundred sixty-six miles
Damnation's back in style

Death Valley, '69
On a death-trip ride
Our egos died
It all comes down to this
Cease to existFeel my heartbeat, gather flowers to spread with the breeze

Forever entwined in each other's arms that never cease to caress
Hold your breath, drink the kiss, the wine of the sun

But again it will pass, the flickering drowned by the darkness of night
The wine of the sun, how long will it last
Forgotten the days, the fever it still burns inside but you're numb
The pain of your life, the time will ever and ever flow on
...flow on...

Don't strangle your heart, but there are things we must learn to accept
Never give up, the shadows can never be cast without light

But who would think of shadows in heavens of bliss?
Where all I crave is the touch of your hands and a kiss...

Down from your clouds
I call upon your reason

Look back on your life - how many kisses and how many scars
The wine of the sun, is it but poison that flows through your heart?
At the gate of dawn inverted you stand with your life in your hands
The pain that you spread, beware the dusk that will turn on your soul

Don't strangle your heart, but there are things we must learn to accept
Never give up, the shadows can never be cast without light

Down from your clouds
I call upon your reason
Open your eyes
And see your self-deceitI tried, I tried to stand,
but I fell, I fell to the ground. 

Lord I try, you know I try
but you see, you see straight through me.You have failed me, I am a godless man
resurrect me, if you can
if you can't, then I will feast
on the souls of the blessed weak

mindless thousands, deaf and blind
of all ages sweet and kind
return me to my sender
drunker, faithless bender

CONFESSION ... destroy these lives I embrace
POSSESSION ... Release this devil inside of me
REDEMPTION ... from this lifetime that I've lived
DELIVERANCE ... staring down, disappearing frown

( when your ways get dark,
and your soul condemns your mind )
( will you speak to my demons,
and heal this splintered mind )

You can't deny, all the destroyed minds
Demon whiskey speaks for me.
just one more, it'll set me free
5 or 6, 8 or 10, demons whiskey speaks for men.

I have stumbled...
blurred and broken in my soul
helpless feelings...
all the chances I've let go.

speeding past me at break neck speeds
watched them love and I've watched them leave
lady love and the drunkards wife
bring that whore to save my life


( when your ways get dark,
and your soul condemns your mind )
( will you speak to my demons,
and heal this splintered mind )Lucid dreams dies away
Eyes wide open gaze
Through the mist from the sea
Into the heart of maze

World devours my corpse
My blood is the waves
Transparent soul in fatigue
Feels the sands of grace

Last and total isolation
Bridges burnt away
Lines and veins cut
Grave left to lay

I see the shores of damnation
I feel the streams of death
I wash the last sins
Then take my first breath

This land of relieving loneliness
So greivous and serene
Like the crowns of sepulchre
So soft to feel

Then the mist rises again
And helps me to forget

I'm out of this useless world
I'm not alive or dead

I'm out of this useless world
I'm not alive or dead5:30 heading nowhere
in the evening sun
turn it over, listen to the roar baby
down a lonesome road

reach over, grab my gun
everybody better run, run, run

6:20 on the prowl
got a score in mind
rev it up, growling down the highway honey
toward the county line

stick that cold steel in his face
so beings the chase

Lady Fatima, don't want none of ya
I'll do it on my own- HEAR ME
Guadalupe -- don't you see me
I leave a trail of thorns - HEAL ME
Santa Muerte you don't scare me
I'll do it on my own - SAVE ME
Guadalupe -- don't you see me
I leave a trail of thorns- HEAL ME

did another just an hour after
it was 8:06
he reached for something, I would find
out later it was a crucifix

I shot a man holding Christ in his hand
prison bound, I will answer then

did another just an hour after
it was 8:06
he reached for something, I would find
out later it was a crucifix

he looked so scared when he saw my eyes
I didn't run as he lay there dyin'

Santa Muerte you don't scare me
I'll do it on my own -SAVE ME
Guadalupe -- don't you see me
I leave a trail of thorns- HEAL ME
Lady Fatima, don't want none of ya
I'll do it on my own- HEAR ME
Guadalupe -- don't you see me
I leave a trail of thorns - HEAL ME

11:20, on the prowl
last score behind
rev it up, growling down the highway mama
toward the county line

12:10, walked through that door squeezed the
trigger, still don't know what for

Lady Fatima, don't want none of ya
I'll do it on my own -- HEAR ME
Guadalupe -- you don't see me
I leave a trail of thorns -- HEAL ME
Santa Muerte you don't scare me
I'll do it on my own -- SAVE ME
Guadalupe -- don't you see me
I leave a trail of thorns -- HEAL ME

Lady Fatima, don't want none of ya
I'll do it on my own -- HEAR ME

Guadalupe -- don't you see me
I leave a trail of thorns -- HEAL ME(Instrumental)Face the truth without fear
Injustice for a dream
Avoid murder in the name
of your testimony

Have you seen a burning brain
Mother in the act of death
Raping for the chosen one
Drilling into a hollow skull

Drown the freak into the sea
Dirt alive in the ground
Polluted massacre's mind
Creeping over the dark

Have you seen tearing nails
Child in the act of flesh
Waiting for the last belief
Building up a safe disquise

Born of the battlefreak
Attacks with weak disease

Planning days in a can
Listening sounds of the night
Sitting in a trance
In different smileThe siege was not the successful one. Korvin was taken by the usurper Erick. & Blaze died during the siege according to Erick's order. Erick ordered to burn Korvin's eyes out & to place him into the dungeon. Will he be consigned to oblivion or will he be able to take vengeance on his enemy for his brother?I'm sitting in this cage
Laying in my silence
Waiting for the time to pass by

Thinking of my past life
I open wide my eyes
Try to reach the stars
And hold them once again

All I want is just a spring in my life
To destroy the sorrow of my broken heart
Life is never what it seems, it is too short
And brakes your bones without saying a word
Saying a word...

You've never thought of me
You've never try to see
They way I live my life
Without you by my side

You live in pretty dreams
I die in nightmare screams
I cannot sleep tonight
I miss your face light

Help me find my way
Don't walk away
Don't leave tonight
I need your face light
And every time that you are close to me
I want to make you see
That you're the world for me(Instrumental)They put a man into space
He shit his pants on the moon
The whole galaxy was watching
The earth's face, dripping yolk
Then he comes back home
And he has a huge garage sale
With a phony wood-grain toilet seat
For five bucks, it's yours.
Astronauts are only human
And humans need souvenirs
You can own the astronaut's toilet seat
Or spend five bucks
On six more beers.Vandaag rottend
morgen blakend
Vandaag smorend
morgen barend

Lluagor de Zuiverende
manen als 1000 zwepen

In glanzende ogen
raast de orkaan
rijst de oceaan
in blauwe regenbogen

Hemelvuur daalt neer
uit wolken gebroken
Door hoefgetrappel
tot eeuwig stof keert alles weerMightiest am I, but I am not alone in this cosmos of mine
For the black hills consists of black souls, souls that already died one
Thousand deaths
Behind the stone walls of centuries they breed their
Black art
Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold
Far up in the mountains, where the rain fall not far, yet the sun cannot reach
The wizards, my servants, summon the souls of macrocosm
No age will escape my wrath
I travel through time and I return to the future
I gather wisdom now lost 
I visit again the eternally ancient caves
Before a mighty Emperor thereupon came Watching the mortals "discovering" my chronicles
Guarded by the old demons, even unknown
To me
Once destroyed their souls are being summoned to my timeless prison of hate 
It is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls
That was destroyed in my future
How many wizards that serve me with evil I know not
My empires has no limits
From the never ending
Mountains black, to the bottomless lakes
I am the ruler and has been for eternity's long
My wizards are many, but their essence is
Mine
Forever there are in the hills in their stone homes of
Grief
Because I am the spirit of their existence
I am them.The obsolete realm is fading like a shadow
Black turns the light there is no tomorrow
The death bringing purpose at last to reveal
Retribution was long to be concealed

The last generation born on earth
Who's going to remember this world
No one will... a curse to whom who will descend
In eternity all sinners repent!

After the clash with darkness you will cower
The other side now shows its power
Tattered by its quiet storm
An invisible all consuming form

The last generation born on earth
Who's going to remember this world
No one will... a curse to whom who will descend
In eternity all sinners repent!

Fist of reckoning smites the ground - fearful to behold
The blessings of the fierce decline - a world seems so cold

Sinners... sinners... sinners... repent

Fist of reckoning smites the ground - fearful to behold
The blessings of the fierce decline - a world seems so cold

Sinners... sinners... sinners... repent

The voices hold no promise... only threat
An uncompromised revolt of the dead
The upcoming age gathers all the scorn
Straight out of hell purity's rebornCrashing with fury into parts unknown
The fallen one, he has no fear
Racing to glory
Leave no stone unturned
The Angel of Death
Is at your door!

Soul Stealer!

Darkness surrounding
Eternal evermore
Fates dying breath
It steals your soul

Forged from pure evil
Ancient demons rise
Haunting visions
Blackened skies

Soul Stealer!

No chance of redemption
The crucible is cast
Damnation rising from the past
Risen from ages
The torment has begun
Unrelenting terror, it's hell undone!

Soul Stealer!
Soul Stealer!
He'll steal your soul!
Soul Stealer!
You're losing control
Soul Stealer!
You've lost your soul!

You've lost your soul!!As I sit in my room at night
I only wish to pain a portrait so vibrant
But my most precious hue is missing
I don't know where the hell it went.

The night that teal went missing
I couldn't draw a sky worth shit.
I don't know where the fuck that crayon is
I hope the dog didn't eat it

Why is this torment placed upon me?
How truly deserving am I?
All I ever wanted to do was color just a little outside of the lines.
Ninety-six shades were given unto me
And my favorite one is missing
I don't think I'll find it there
But I'm gonna go check the kitchen

The night that teal went missing
I couldn't draw a sky worth shit.
I dunno where the fuck that crayon is.
I hope the dog didn't eat it.
I don't know what to do, my favorite shade of blue, is gone from this world.
How am I supposed to color in a sky with cerulean and purple?Blind by the rain they stayed inside 
I swept through the dark in silent poise 
Propelled by suspension, twisting skies 
Are bathing as lights rejoice 
Scorned as I wandered, cast in shadows 
Resting a heart of stout 
Chained by believers kept from doubt 
I watched as the wind blew south 

Sleeping deathless (It has such strange relation) 
Speaking breathless (Lost inside translation) 
Seeping restless (They'll not attain salvation) 
Slain defenseless (And thus I bleed creation) 
Torn remorseless (And with my conscious shattered) 
Deformed with force (Organic formless matter) 
It was born to dissolve my lord ( The astral order's ordination) 
And form disintegration 

And I emerge upon the stark end of madness 
To prey upon the ones so filled with fear 
Forever warned by the dusk of temptation 
Sucked inside like particles of wandered skin 

Deep in the wisdom tied so wise 
In keeping the system live 
When have I been here, sometime before? 
To watch as the lights befall 
Sleeping deathless (It has such strange relation) 
Speaking breathless (Lost inside translation) 
Seeping restless (They'll not attain salvation) 
Slain defenseless (And thus I bleed creation) 
Torn remorseless (And with my conscious shattered) 
Deformed with force (Organic formless matter) 
It was born to dissolve my lord ( The astral order's ordination) 
And form disintegration 
Who is this precipitous demon who screams so high? 
With might and despair he cries 
Rising to surface he's nearing to his time 
Fading to purpose his destiny 

Bleached in digital streams 
The pattern begins of binary seams 
Forward encoding, I am testing the sequence 
Next, is the lack of existence 
This must be the result of some miscalculation 
I must have forgotten this when I was losing your mind 

Stuck in the maze I am entangled 
Sinking into terrestrial arteries 
I am entangled(Instrumental)Astral Conversions, spiritual modes 
Invalid termination of a tyrant yoke 
Parasites of innocence, the accident of god, 
the plague of suffering reminds the coming of the fall... 

Depraved emotions, a sanctum place. 
Zodiac circle, the signs of Hell. 
The law of heritage on a chimera based, 
labyrinth of genesis division's parade. 

Electric perversion for a human being 
perpetual motion like an infinite sin. 
A schism of holiness, the science of will, 
crossing the universe with nails and dreams 

Religious archetype, the parody of a mass 
the void solution like a God with mask 
Artificial silence, a never ending faith 
the roots of abhorrence command the instinct of hate... 

Insulting the virtues of a sun with an endless light 
Between... between the ruins of the mind 
Defecting to the esoteric isolation like an eye 
You are incited to betray... 

Possessed by visions, an ultrasonic end 
Chemical systems... of the broken DNA 
a soul with chains 
the egg of knowledge 

Depraved the spirit of those who keep the flames 
Behold the eruption of the cosmic seer 

A vortex of renewal - A whirlpool of soulsThis grisly din of killing steel (murder is my God)
I Come in peace, you go in pieces (murder is my God)
Fools like us and the Gods we trust (murder is my God)
To save the world and watch it burn (murder is my God)
Ploughing ash, a sea of limbs (murder is my God)
The stench of gore and boiling brains (murder is my God)

My Beautiful genocide

A holy war, unholy blood (murder is my God)
Divided faith Blown apart (murder is my God)
Burn and rape on planet hell (murder is my God)
All fucked up, wrong way rounds. (murder is my God)

Disgusting revolting culmination

Edge of an axe falled
on the woman's head
Blood? Beautiful
Who's turn is it now?
Two sweet little girls
A few blows on the kids faces
Then knife opened all bellies
He scattered bowels
with pleasure around
Bowels, liver, kidneys

Abdominal orgasm
Disgusting revolting culmination
Abdominal orgasm
Disgusting revolting culmination

From the pregnant corpse
he pulled out a children
He cutted his belly
And by the limb to the his genitals
By the hole in a belly
he observed this performance
The end? After the several orgasm.

Abdominal orgasm
Disgusting revolting culmination
Abdominal orgasm
Disgusting revolting culminationVertical puncture wound 
Dagger sharp as it could 
Lacerate from the start 
Straight up, right to the heart 

The victim so vulnerable 
Where is the constable 
Murder once more again 
Next time, it's you my friend 

Slash and rip up your skin 
Your stomach's where I begin 
Dissect and mutilate 
Straight up, right to your face 

Your ugly face 

Because I'm gonna gouge your eyes out 
And tie 'em up with your intestines 
It'll be such a work of art as you fucking die... 

Straight up is where I go 
Judgement day is the show 
To hell is where I am 
At peace in the promise land 

The promise land!Dawn breaks with a strange odour wafting into the cemetery on an icy breeze. In the depths of the swamp a skeletal traveler quietly pushes through the slime in a small canoe. Somewhere in the Basilisk's palace the crystal skull emits a low hum... 

Death in the SwampMONSTROUS AND MORBID MONUMENT
IN THIS CITY OF THE DEAD CORNERS
STREETS ARE FLOATING
WITH NAUSEA
THE STENCH OF HORRORS
FROM THE ALLEYS

THE SUN IS DYING, THE MOON IS DYING
THE AIR IS DYING AND THE EARTH IS DEAD
THE MASK IS FALLING, THE TIME IS FALLING
THE WORLD IS FALLING AND I'M NOT DEAD

FIVE CORNERS OF THIS PLANET
ARE COLLAPSING
IN ONE DIRECTION 
A DOWNWARD WIND
HOWLS IN OUR EARS
AND WE CAN'T HEAR OUR PRAYERS

THE SUN IS DYING, THE MOON IS DYING
THE AIR IS DYING AND THE EARTH IS DEAD
THE MASK IS FALLING, THE TIME IS FALLING
THE WORLD IS FALLING AND I'M NOT DEAD

CIVILIZED TRIBES
IN EACH OTHERS THROATS
SISTERS FIERCELY KILLING THEIR BROTHERS
CHILDREN LEFT OUTSIDE FOR WOLVES
A PREDATOR RISES
FROM THE RUINS

THE LAST SPAWN
OF THIS WEAK NATION
GATHES FOR THE LAST SALVATION
SICKENING FORCE FROM INSIDE
THIS IS THE END
OF THIS CIVILIZED TRIBE

THE SUN IS DYING
THE MOON IS DYING
THE AIR IS DYING
AND THE EARTH
AND THE EARTH IS DEADAfter a thousand light years of distrust and anger, you could never pull yourself out of the common clone.
Swallow these daggers and bleed your gums, and I'll show your what it is like to suffer in reality. 
Cruelly yet subtle I'll replace your ears with a hallway so you can hear my voice reverberate off your brain. 
I am in higher power by disposing of your limbs, as you lay helpless and putrid.
I'll rape and pillage everything you've  ever loved. 
Dispose of your fairy tale biblical thoughts, and exposes your pride.
Open up to a human being that you can really be, stop fighting with your conscious , and believe in what you want to feel is right. 
Your punching holes through your stomach and wasting.Symptoms of death trans-mutate my mind
As society buries me in horrendous graves
I choke on the overpopulated human
Dare to waste my breath of life
An earthly element to be respected
Nevertheless. shamelessly
Not by the filthy human

I am the electric eel. and I shall peel
Them away from their miserable lives
Soul stealing and reeling them in
Like fish from the lake of plenty
I am their Jesus
The lord of the soul rode check
Never to return. you drift endlessly about
With a number in your hand

I try to stuff yet another soul into my spirit case
Draining these mental minds into mine
I`ve become humanity`s filterI am winter dormant in my solitude
You are spring alive and with new growth
I am summer burning in my beatitude
You are fall shedding leaves grown old

Just when the circle's drawn
Just then the circle's gone
The circle's gone

I am petals found in frail wayside flowers
You are wind blowing bare open
I am sunlight showering the rays of play
You are sand soft yet hard as stone

Just when the circle's drawn
Just then the circle's gone
The circle's gone

Merging with the land now
With all things
And all the beings
Knowing I am one now
With my vision
With all the feeling

I am winter, you are spring
I am petals, you are wind

Faith fills my inner space
Clears my circle's place
Turns me inside out
Moves away my doubt

Just when the circle's drawn
Just then the circle's gone
The circle's gone

Just when the circle's drawn
Just then the circle's gone
The circle's goneAnd over his chest the covers in the ultimate dream
Will mount to the teeth, ascend the eyes, press back
The locks while round his sturdy belly gleam

(solo) (2:55)(Instrumental)all that I wanted is to lay under ground
this world is not for me, so I die as a god (of emptiness)
I want to retire from a place for which I don't care
my world, it dies too, but my life will not end down there
nobody will see me, where I fumble in the dark
and exploring for dimensions where my spirits will grow

now I see the cerecloth closing above me
no thinking for the future, for now no future for me
the maggots will soon feed, crowling through and over me
but my soul will search for dimensions of eternity

my spirit, will show the path
where you can see, my forgotten rests
a miserable, disfigured tomb
lay some flower, for my tired soul

it will wake me, and I'll be thereWell love is quite a very special thing
It helps us to get over with the worst that we can think
My story is so tragically sad
It nearly made me desperate, yes, it nearly drove me mad

It started once in heaven when I first met her in May
I had never thought that it would end this way

And we made it all together and we gave us all we had
She would gather all the flowers, I would carry her on hands
But then clouds were growing darker and disease had blurred her eyes
So we fought against the ending and I watched my lady die
Romance in black
Romance in black

I got to live without her from now on
But never I will lose her love, although she might be gone
The body laid to rest under her stone
I'm left to be a loner but no left to be alone

It started once in heaven, now it ended in the clay
She will always be inside me, anyway

And we made it all together and we gave us all we had
She would gather all the flowers, I would carry her on hands
But then clouds were growing darker and disease had blurred her eyes
So we fought against the ending and I watched my lady die
Romance in black
Romance in black
Romance in black
Romance in black, yeah!

The ultimate hard evidence for alienation

Microbial mat is basking in the sand
Traverse the galaxy and you will understand

And soon the rain will flood and fall
Before carbon dioxide brings the ultimate deathcall

Everyone knows that life only existed
Because the infrared spectrum persisted

500 million to two billion years ago
The molecular clock had nowhere to go

We try and try
No matter what
Minutes still fly by

We try so hard
Ain't worth a dime
There's no escape
From the smell of time

Smell of time

Bingo, baby, you just won a Prius
Would you mind filling out the questionaire?
Someone goes on a phishing trip
Your life savings vaporize into thin air

Masturbation for dummies
Carrot lover or carnivore
The political agenda
Is going out the mahogany door

No matter how
We try and try
No matter what
Minutes still fly by

We try so hard
Ain't worth a dime
There's no escape
From the smell of time

Everyone despises you in the waiting line
Spanking that monkey is such a drag
You can't bring toothpaste on the plane
But we seal your liquor in a special plastic bag

Sure, the furniture's cheap
But someone always has to pay
A Messiah complex the size of the T.Rex
Can be yours to own today

Besserwissers and assholes
Take the exit to the left
That console gives you arthritis
So no more grand auto theft

Climate changes and terrorist threats
Have become part of everyday life
Mow the lawn at any cost
While your brother is banging your wife

No matter how
We try and try
No matter what
Minutes still fly by

We try so hard
Ain't worth a dime
There's no escape
From the smell of timeThey're drowning in their lies
Masters of hypocrisy
They're playing impure matches
with the smiles on faces always
No heart in their bodies
Chameleons of new times
in brains own the profit
They re spitting to faces of nation
Decomposition or state
Fight between the bastards
Before years tyrants of totality
just now they're reining again

Political whores!
Slaves of nation!

Cheaters from the front 
It's the scorn to all people 
The revolution was a big swindle 
We re fucking on your laws 
and we don t believe your liesWe gaze through past
Mourning for the times to come
Wind blows from the desert
Eyes are bleeding from the dust
Rays from the setting Sun
Are shattered in a blurry mirage
Shaped by transcending tremolo
Of cracking sanity
Babies drop like bombs from the wombs
Birth is a tragedy
Saw it in a dream
Emptiness was gathered
As a token, an epitaph
In the end it's all we have
Bodies drop like bombs into the tombs
Life is an open wound, thirsty soil beneathThe old legends always make stars shine
cause within it seems that they hide truths
even though the tales are just some old fantasies
love makes you believe they're real.

Once upon a time in far and lonely lands
an evil witch existed
no brave knight could defeat her
and the spirit of death still remains in the air.

[CORO]

At daylight demons surround her
she will not wait for evil to arise
but when stars become candles
the most precious maiden shall be born again

No curse is worse than this
but hope is the last thing that dies
there's one way that this witchcraft could be undone
the secret is inside_her heart

The lord of the night has decided
your salvation will be your wickness
a child of light is inside your womb
and the seed of the king is your harvest.

[CORO]

[SOLO]

Finally the day has come
was easy to turn on the passion
the king fell on his knees by desire
the joy of freedom is trapped in a damned knife

She felt strengthless, her hands have opened
she brokedown in tears and misery
her mind was crushed by her heart
a lost heart damned with "the neverlove curse"You think you're all alone I have seen the shit you've thrown
Just become to much for me this feeling of now being free
Cause I don't know where you should go but you can walk away from me
Cause I know you've been chasing dreams with me and I don't wanna make a scene

Cause I thought I was craving for freedom
Cause I know I was craving for you
Cause I though I was in for the time of my life
Now all I am doing is time for lige

Now that I'm all alone I can start succeed in life
It's not hard to see you walk looking at you face no more
All the things you said to me all about being free
Been staring at the wall awhile looking for an alibi

Cause I thought I was craving for freedom
Cause I know I was craving for you
Cause I though I was in for the time of my life
Now all I am doing is time for lige

Cause I thought I was craving for freedom
Cause I know I was craving for you
Cause I though I was in for the time of my life
Now all I am doing is time for lifeUtmost disgust, fullest extent
Up from their ditches and into the trenches

Feelin' like a dog that's been beat
Restrained on a tight chain
A savage on a short leash
Backed up against the wall, at the end of my rope
Feelin' like I just got stabbed
In my throat

Utmost disgust, fullest extent
Up from their ditches and into the trenches

Blessed with this curse
In the city of my birth
Bottom feeders fed the filth that funnels down
Alcoholic gunfire, this town has made me proud

Backed up against the wall
At the end of my rope
Feelin' like I just got
Stabbed in my throatThe battle screams cry
on this conquest we fight
The witches fly
The warlord die
In fields of blood 
all demons run

In battles we ride
The cold of night
The warlocks fly
As all dieThis is the room, the start of it all
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall
I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained

Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?

These are your friends from childhood through youth
Who goaded you on, demanded more proof
Withdrawal pain is hard and do you right in
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin

Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?

This is the car at the edge of the road
There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat
There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak

Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?

This is the room, the start of it all
Through childhood, through youth, I remember it all
Oh, I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained

Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?Oh, once upon a time there were four little kids with a dream in mind
They were raised with hope and a little twist of insanity,
Yeah, oh, yeah
'Cause they, they've tried to put us down
They've tried to turn our smiles around
They have cut our hearts into pieces
Served on a silver plate, yeah
Served on a silver plate

Cry out loud
Singing proud
About our rock'n'roll fairy tale
We'll be leaving all the sorrow behind
In the night
We unite
And we'll take control
We'll be leaving the sad disillusions behind

We're proud,
We're larger than life
We're brighter than the moon in the sky
We're proud
Proud of the days gone by

Uh, yeah

The kids at later age
They were taken and locked up inside a cage
Still the playground of their fantasy was a rocking stage,
Yeah, oh, yeah
What they don't know is that we believe in our music, in what we've achieved
So far, so good, they don't know who they are fighting with
Who they are fighting with

Cry out loud
Singing proud
About our rock'n'roll fairy tale
We'll be leaving all the sorrow behind
In the night
We unite
And we'll take control
We'll be leaving the sad disillusions behind

We're proud,
We're larger than life
We're brighter than the moon in the sky
We're proud
Proud of the days gone by

Walk away
Sail away from all our fears
Our dreams will be free from tears
'Cause I'm proud and you're proud
We are proud of our fantasies

Walk away from the cruel things they say
Our dreams will break through today
'Cause I'm proud and you're proud
We are proud of our fantasies, yeah

Oh, once upon a time there were four little kids with a dream in mind
Still the playground of their fantasy was a rocking stage, yeah

Cry out loud
Singing proud
About our rock'n'roll fairy tale
We'll be leaving all the sorrow behind
In the night
We unite
And we'll take control
We'll be leaving the sad disillusions behind

We're proud,
We're larger than life
We're brighter than the moon in the sky
We're proud
Proud of the days gone by

Uh, yeah

'Cause we're proud(Instrumental)Standing on the shore of a broken relationship
The tears drops into the ocean of memories
In the cold light of the stars
A single word comes to the dying mind
Never, hits the face of the night
But not so convinced as hoped
The thought to leave it all behind
To continue, feels so impossible

Sacrificing your whole life to the one
Still getting nothing in return
Nothing is so unfair as love
Yet it's the only hope

Staring into the past
Searching for the question why
Feeding the madness, refusing to let it go
The feeling of being immortal
Happiness returns remembering it
Just to be killed by the brutal truth
The never ending struggle continues
To start all over again

Sacrificing your whole life to the one
Still getting nothing in return
Nothing is so unfair as love
Yet it's the only hope

After forever the past is buried
Facing the world full of hope
Looking for a future in the ocean
Driven by the wasted tears
Then suddenly the forgotten one
Walks by with it's new victim
And the jealousy crushes the dreams(Instrumental)Vast seas of molten waste,
the always visible horizon
a fractal plane slowly opens itself to me...
release my mind from the body
allow me soar into new realms of consciousness
all hitherto uknown to manToday my lord I shall avow
the pain my heart's been bearing.
To speak with lips is little,
but if it could my soul would say it.
It's great sin to swear unto a sin
and lying is a capital sin
so I can't explain myself why
so many follow the path of Ganelon.
As new Iscariots blossom
and Sinnons are in bloom
it seems we are all doomed to
suffer the fate of Laocoon.
Betrayal, painful demise of feeling and faith and even believes.
Cuts deeply beneath your eyes and
blinds them with disease.

VERSE A

And it's a guessing game,
an easy task guessing
someone's gonna stab us next.
I'll set up a court, to relieve
the stress, sing my troubles
off to rest.

And it might be late, for you at last
the seed of treason, makes a nest.
I'll keep on my fight with those who jest,
surely put my patience to test.

CHORUS

Have you ever lied or deceived?
If you'll be caught lying you'll be dead.
Have you ever lied or deceived?

Soon I'll be
someone else.
I feel the cold bite.
Darkness embraces me softly as I
fall, fall, fall...
Hold me, hold me... please...
This can't be real.

VERSE B

Limitless undying hate,
in this maze I can't even find my way.
In the end, I'm the one to blame,
to give away my trust I must not be sane.

Filled with laughter to hide the pain,
behind this mask all shades turn to gray.
It doesn't matter, let's keep on this game.
Here I am, let's go back to the court
again.When on my own
I feel free
I can refuse
Arms wait enfold
Nothing left for me
Waiting
PulpI am your heroin 
that controls the eruption of Gods
Descending the spheres of thousand (black) aeons
an equal gravity of worms...
A fortune of Cosmos
A fragile dream...

Putrescence at levels, the Age of distant zones
an architect of marionettes... diabolical spawns
Reforming all the characters of the "gentle" mankind
extremity with sequence by nature's side

I am your scars
of the failing unity
A symmetry of numbers, an empty code
an equal gravity of worms
The only eternity
A filthy steroid entwine the truth and false

Annihilated codes with artificial rules
Incarnating the virus of generative wombs
A sun that regulates the organical soils
Confusing all the energies of a visual choice

I am the Virus of human's purity 
I am the Code of every human sin

Invoking my poison that leads to the other side
A product of evil corrupting the faith of I

God of Heaven 
Hear my cries of anguish, I'm in pain 
I've suffered a thousand deaths but I live on in vain 

Death would greet with eternal sleep 
My soul would come to peace 
My life had ceased 
The time was come 
Can no-one hear my plea 

Lowered down in the moistened ground 
Into the dark and cold 
My heartbeat the only sound 
Pain tears my limbs and soul 

I scream for mercy 
Hear my cries 
Oh, Lord don't abandon me 
I'm so tired 
Grant me the eternal sleep 

I tear at the lid I'm suffering 
In a cold and nameless grave 
If Hell is what awaits me 
I feel no fright 

Buried and forgotten 
In a cold and nameless grave 
If there's a God in heaven 
Hear my call from the grave...... 

[Repeat last two verses]have we done enough? 
to carry on with love and compassion 
have we shared enough? 
our stories of subsisting life as a painful journey 
here is our destiny - god has shown thy mercy 

[february - march 2013]Falling down
deeper inside your senseless smile
Can't keep away all this rage
Now everything's cutting your mind
Spreading decay

Stand up proud
feeling your life like a shining prize
Relentless your sand flows away
Remember the time of crimes
You're fading away

Every tear is a stone
Crushing this ground of illusions and void
Tear down these walls

No refuge to hide away, no choices
Childhood fears turn back to life
Lies and tears will close your eyes

Crying shouts
that's what you left in your careless world
Refusing to find out your lights
Too late for a chage, now prepare
To face all your sins

Blinded sights
No wonder, no doubts, now payback is here
In silence you'll suffer and pray
For death to catch all of your breaths
The torture begins

Every tear is a stone
Crushing this ground of illusions and void
Tear down these walls

No refuge to hide away, no choices
Childhood fears turn back to life
Lies and tears will close your eyes(Instrumental)I wake up at the night by whispers
The blue winter is full of fear
But it calls me with its kisses
Its charm impervious

Moonlight is invisible
Only stars reflect light
But it's darkness that leads me
Through crippled trees

Darkness leads me to death
And I follow darkness

Over the frozen lake, the great mirror
Which spreads this light around
Across the wolves and their howl
Through the souls and their screams

Through the nail-filled air
Into dark caves
Over the dead mounds
To the realm of death

Darkness leads me to death
And I follow darknessLife is, what you fear. truth
Is. what you repress
Expecting, things that cannot
Be done. from a world, build
On dreams. from a world,
That you build your self. pain,
Emptiness, disgrace. is all
What you feel. living, with
Blind eyes. lacking, of
Respect. laughing, at other
Ones. and pain, is all what
You get. your life, is
Changeable. but you have to

(x4)(Instrumental)Back to the stars, back to the time when the first sign of life arose.
Am I created in three days is the unsolved question to ask.

Or stand this number for the billion years of development?
'Cause certain is that nothing was created by godly hands
it is a slow evolution from the elder forms of life.
Which has started from the first organic cells.

Are we the children of an erected walking primate?
Who left long ago the animal kingdom

the development of our higher intellect and mind has
reached an unbelievable high level
is it true that the results of our intelligence are the
results of and endless evolution

reincarnated message live forth in our subconscious's.
Impossible to understand the progress we've made
incomprehensible the path we've walked 'till now, 'till now, 'till now.

Only mankind gets civilized by remembering his yesterdays
dreams of tomorrow,
but only mankind memorized the kindness of the past to forget the
forget the cruelties of tomorrow

imaginative power can bring us to an abstract reality.
Maybe then we can find some evidence of the source of our intelligenceNothing looks the same anymore

Look at my face 
Can you see me 
without the future ? 
without illusions ? 
I scream in fury 
I ask for help

won't you forget me ? 

I listen only your advices 
and following them 
I go straight to abyss. 

Don't go away.

I ask for help 
won't you leave ? 
won't you let me down ? 

Don't go away.

How I was wrong.counting days at night
wasting so much time
I've played all my cards
in a senseless game

so unkind - no way out can be found
I take up time - to make my mind up

drown inside a mess
I wish myself away
while there's life, there's hope,
"can't you see?"

end in sight - the aim to fight for
will you take care? Will you be there?

this time I dare to relieve
to end the days on my own
sunlight won't heal
a heart that won't feel
no one can save me - tomorrow is the end

I'm feeling so unrest
in this breathless chase
life has passed me by
I lock the door
my end in sight - the aim to fight for

this time I dare to relieve
to bring this life to an end
will you take care?
will you be there?
sharing the pain but tomorrow is the end
in sightHave you ever thought, about the meaning of your life
Getting drunk, getting laid you might say, or are you taking it dead serious

Give it up
There is no reason
Stop wasting your time
We have no purpose, we're obsolete

As if you really cared anyway, about the rest of humanity
All comes down to the same thing, the little thing called egocentria

Give it up
There is no reason
Stop wasting your time
We have no purpose, we're obsolete

Stay behind the line
Do not interfere
Stay behind the line
Do not interfere

Your actions are totally useless, no one cares in the end
Why try to help people that don't want it

Give it up
There is no reason
Stop wasting your time
We have no purpose, we're obsolete(Instrumental)A trip on psylocibine

Frustrations, depredations, this damned place
Would you give it all up
just for the little of bemushroomed grace?

"What today is resolved into the effects of a mere drug
a tryptamine or lysergic acid derivative, was for them
a prodigious miracle, inspiring in them poetry
philosophy and religion."

Phantasmagorical scenes
Beyond the veil of low-life schemes
A quick fix of madness and eternity juxtaposed.

Hollow creations, legislations
Caught within the social maze
End it up, give it up
Welcome to biosynthetic space.

"In truth, he is the five senses disembodied
all of them keyed to the height
of sensivity and awarness
all of them blending into one another most strangely
until the person, utterly passive
becomes a pure receptor
in delicate, of sensations.

As your body lies there in its sleeping bag
your soul is free
Loses all sense of time,alert as it never was before
Living an eternity of night
seeing infinity in a grain of sand.

What you have seen or heard is cut as with the burin
into your memory
Never to be effaced."

" Then, indeed, as you lie there bemushroomed
listening to the music and seeing visions
you know a soul-shattering experience
recalling as you do the belief of some primitive peoples
that mushrooms, the sacred mushrooms
are divinely engendered by Jupiter Fulminans
the god of the lighting bolt, in the soft mother earth."Interplanet space physics

Run if you want, there's no safe place

To spread a message of peace and love.
Or maybe splice your genes and bathe in your blood.
To save you from self-inflicted extinction.

Cursed eclipse appears
Fullmoon of darkness is back
Priest is cursed by the one about to be blessed
Unbaptise me lord satan
Make me whole as the beast and the man
Howls under the moonlight
Predict innocent blood to be sacrificed
Horny beast to be satisfied
distrubed by spiritual tormentors
Psychotic pathfinders ready to die for the causeThe years of decay are now already past 
my pulverised torso is even marked with disgust
maggots infest my coffin
and decomposition sets in

Laying and rotting in my own secretions
this may be the firts sign of putrefaction
as i awake in my grave
and whip the maggots from my faceDeep beneath the darkest sea 
We pledged our hearts in silence 
Hoping not someone would turn us loose 
We embarked on a zero path 
Which has been long time lost 

Making love in godforsaken halls 
Of marble, blood and ice 
Giving birth to a sacred one 
Amongst the blissful silhouettes 

Will our child grant us rebirth 
... as darkness sweeps all over the place 
Will this spawn of ours be a true-born conqueror 
... as pain sweeps all over... 

Deep beneath the darkest sea 
We pledged our hearts in silence 
Hoping not someone would turn us loose 
We embarked on a zero path 
Which has been long time lost 

Will our child grant us rebirth 
... as darkness sweeps all over the place 
Will this spawn of ours be a true-born conqueror 
... as pain sweeps all over... 

As pain sweeps all over you and me...This is where they rose and fell
Things will keep to follow the same patterns
Once ill-defined, now much-accepted
No such real sense of anomaly
Winds have blown away every inch-block of debris
from the rubbles of our tragic yesterdays

Scenes will always in changing positions,
but I doubt if they are progressing and transforming
Way we manage our lives on earth is
the way we destroy our desirable future

And we have tried, at least we've tried
to heal ourselves and learn from the past
Unexpected, the gazing X-factors
start to crush from the inside
Time has washed away
all these traumatic moments the earth once had,
but will our children be free from all the wars?

Scenes will always in changing positions,
but I doubt if they are progressing and transforming
Way we manage our lives on earth is
the way we destroy our desirable future

Like thick black dots in continuum,
we will never erase or take them off the line
So many nails have pierced down our wooden existence,
leaving all these black holes until it comes to an endThousand years ago
in the first years of the Church
Terrors aimed to the Apostles...
...because of following the Truth
Authorities opposed their teachings
of love, hope, and faith
And if they couldn't find something to dispute
Oppression rose through the abuse of power

Those with thoughts of evil
Hate the Word of God
They tried to stop the spirit of enlightenment
Attacking those that have a heart
and love for Life
But the fearless ones are never giving up
Believe in the guidance of The Lord

Stand for the truth
Follow the way conscience goes
No one can stop your fire sincerity
Keep on fighting
Against all conspiracies
that based on the false intentions

There have been times of persecutions
And still present until today
In these wicked days, it's not an easy way
Through trials by fire faith is strengthen

Many people have gone away
Given up what they believe
If you live in fear then pray
God will give His children a power to

Fight, for the truth
A call of humanity
Never, feed the flesh...
...and give a chance to this wicked world(Instrumental)Tired of being told what to think
The man spreads his word on the street
People around him tries not to listen
But they know he's right
That night the system comes to visit
A different opinion is fatal
A danger to the society
Tortured and killed for his word

Executing the free speech
Big brother dictator secures his reign
Executing the free speech
The vicious circle goes on

Someone somewhere asks a question
What happened to him 
Who? He was never born... 
A whole life wiped out in seconds
Your every move is registered
Don't eat, sleep or speak
Unless you're told to
And they won't knock on your door

Executing the free speech
Big brother dictator secures his reign
Executing the free speech
The vicious circle goes on

Welcome slavery and starvation with open arms
Live your life as a mindless puppet
Be proud of your "Big Brother"
And you might survive his reign of terrorThe speed of light is
Necessary consequence
Density diminishes
support increases

Supercluster!
Supercluster!

An object as massive
The source of radiation
Expansion of space calculates
the age of
everything's formation

Supercluster!
Supercluster!

Time elapsed since the change
approximate rate

density is way

The oldest chemicals
Are atomic and nuclear
Matter is created
Through thermal equilibriumBlank fear holding you 
Torn across a different plains of view 
Spoke to me, softly again 
Tell me how you're not like them 
If you remembered me, you'd know that I've never been 
The holy one 
As far as i can see, no truth conspiracy 
I've ripped my ribs out, 
I'm clean 
If I could have seen the things you have seen 
I wish I could have known, no mercy would be shown. 
Doorways open more ways than one 
Times and oceans turn men to mice 
Take my rights and wash away my fears 
Hold my hands deny all our demands 
Raise the cup, embrace in my blood 
Close your eyes, the all-seeing denied 
Doorways open more ways than one 
All things broken turn into dust 
Breaking my bones, shattered and forced to survive 
cover my mouth as you wait for me to die! 
Benevolent, facing you defeat 
pick at the bones right under your feet 
My enemies lost in my nightmare 
hurt-less, soulless, chains of apathy 
I was once their demon of despair 
Ripped open wounds 
Time could not repair! 
Breaking my bones, shattered and forced to survive 
cover my mouth as you wait for me to die...(Instrumental)The visions of my troubled sleep
Brought to me through astral dimensions
are warnings foretelling events
of global cataclysmic proportions
I know not the fate for my kinsmen, yet mine is
to remain
The survival of the many, shall be through the
memory of the few
My dreams descends...
I am the one, I witness the re-birth of time
Few but me have seen beyond the stars, yet I
have seen, I have seen
Crashing thorugh the walls of time, our world
will be cast down
I hold the key to unlock the paths, when your
end becomes so real
Live through the dream
Time is reborn, the sooil runes red, cleansing the
circle of life
Reborn is our world, as I foresaw, so it begins
as it ends
Live throught the dream, this is our paradiseHigh gold
Holy noon
Ribbons of gas
Flailing across the Sun

Boil the anchors
Scatters the spangles
Lift up the limp red tongs

Scald the glowing gauntlets
And molten coin
Eradicate the shadows
Ignite the wool

High gold
Holy noon
Ribbons of gas
Flailing across the SunFrozen in glass, Extracted by machine
Cold souls!

Don't take it away

Soul removal, appointment today
Frozen in storage and here it will stay
Emotional death, not as perfect as it seems
DMT in suspense, pausing all your dreams

Cold souls bear no fruit
Trees of life cut at the root

Don't take it from me, it is my essence
So unassuming, stop what you're doing!

Where is my blackness, the one I know so well?
Stored in the basement of a concrete hell
Purgatory, sub-zero icy chill
Sold onto another...

Cold souls bear no fruit
Trees of life cut at the root

Don't take it from me, it is my essence
So unassuming, stop what you're doing!
 
Frozen in glass, Extracted by machine
Cold souls!

They've misplaced my soul
So I took another instead
The donor took their own life
No dreams now.(Instrumental)Lay my warm seed down, and my blood,
into the caress of soil
To brew new life within this earthy womb
He shall be my image, not beautiful but able
This living being that I've created

More from him I shall gain than I ever did from God
Feeding me with all these answers
And what does this make me then
if not one among the other gods?
Matched by none I walk this earth

But when the rays from the holy Heaven fall down
I'll fall down before the Lord(Instrumental)We're death metal and we are bad
We look at old ladies crossly
We're death metal and we are mean
We go to the mall and cause a scene
We're death metal and we are fleet
We won't help ladies cross the street
We're death metal and we like thrash
We won't do the monster mash

Cauldron of Puke!
Cauldron of Puke!
Cauldron of PukeCries of laughter beneath me
As i hang by my neck
Choking on a rope
Till i'm near death
Suffocating rapidly
It's my last breath
Cut to the ground
And stabbed in the chest
Hung, drawn and qurtered

Bloods then drained out
In a gory way
Spilling out memories
The soil turns red
Sucked through my torso
And ripped apart
Severed into quarters
Rigor-mortis sets in(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Unable to draw a line
Unable to stay alive
The bell just rang and you don't know why

Unaware of your condition
Way too blind for any ambition
Well, you will get no recognition

My vengeance will be sublime
Once I committ my meanest crime

Lay your weapons down
You won't be the talk of the town

Never followed any trend
never been your best friend
Cuz I can't even fake a ten percent

You're too busy to realise
That yyou're sinking into ice
This defeat will close your eyesIn that place of lunacy and murder stand-the great saboath-cast fourth into desolate horizons-from here stood and gazed at the sky-screams of the lost still echo-fore here stood their light-here stood their god-and here it fell : and though its figure lies broken-still its maddening shadows dance-in the lightless twilight-where the luminance died-where the stones of binding still-lie shattered.I've gone so far my soul is lost
I think I'll fall beneath my post
So long this river's been my host
This water knows now I am lost

Fall x 4

The river drops me through cascading falls
My essence through a fast abyss rolls
I taste the decadence of my soul
This silence screams chasing my fallMy life is rushing in slow motion,
All i did, i did it with total devotion
Tears are now dripping from eyes
Is it really time to say good-bye?
Am i one of those,
Love dwells deep in its heart?
An attempt, i failed...
And love dwells so far...
All hope, for a musical existence, has gone
I buried my dream, reconciliation is done
Life now slips away, am i only dreaming?
New intentions, other dimensions are breeding
Am i one of those,
Love dwells deep in its heart?
An attempt, i failed...
And love dwells so far...Thank you, (George Magalini and hello CSSO).(Instrumental)Black clouds coming from the west
I've never been your member
Bloody party, party of death
Dirty hands on bloody banner
You've come. You've broken my life
I've stayed without future
Who am I, I live in slums
Oh, God I'm real stupid
MY GOD IS STUPID

You are gifted to destroy
I was gifted at creation
You treated me like a dirt
Holding party like a satan
Get out, get out of my way
You wanna kill each other
Where's the strenght that kill you too
Who's to save the freedom flower?

He said

Don't believe in God
I can give you more power of my faith
Wealth of world & human race


You've built the kingdom of death
Fucking priest became satan
Million slaves we are all your wealth
Black night is what you're waiting for
Black clouds coming from the west
I've never been your member

Bloody party, party of death
Dirty hands on bloody banner

DEAD MAN IS WALKING
DEAD MAN IS WALKING
DEAD MAN IS WALKING
DEAD MAN IS WALKINGIn the abandoned realm of the dread lord
Blaze in the world around

Upon his fury throne
The stars will shine ever bright

Praise, we praise the opus of the damned
Praise, we praise the opus of the damned

Dread lord - entangle those free
Dread lord - besotted is the beast in thee
Dread lord - unfurl your clutch at heavens with
Dread lord - gut the souls you feast upon

Bayonet of a fallen race, sacrilege of sinners in pain,
Hate religions spawned by sickening world domain
Dead all rise and purify the lands
Of bewildered mannequins

Dread Lord - bow!"I gaze into the glittering sky, 
To which I am drawn by the revealing of stars 
I feel my subconscious ascending int the unknown, 
To begin an odyssey of knowledge" 

The immense cloaking blackness fills me with dread, 
And yet a desire to be consumed 
By it's utter magnificence 
Above me I feel the presence of the keys 
To unlock the paths that I must tread 
(Watching them fade, drifting out to the sky) 
The distilled brooding tranzuil sky 
Brings back to me my visions of dread 
(Denied their lives, empty souls drift...) 
ETERBALLY!! 

Of wheb the ocean shall overcome my land, 
And this haven shall be swept into despair 
Devoid of life, a barren wasted womb 

"Until these, my visions, reveal themselves 
To the children of this world, 
I remain awaiting my true enlightenment 
And as the stars fall into place, 
I cower beneath the storm, 
As this cosmic mechanism comes into play..." 

[J. Fogarty 21.9.97](Instrumental)*lyrics lost*Lost in void and darkness
wandering so meaningless
the silence feels like the loudest noice
even when I can't hear it
I don't know where i'm going
and there's thousands of paths
all of them end the same way-
a sudden irrelevant dead end

I can see forms in the darkness
i don't know are they there
I try to scream
but my voice just disappears
my mind is flooding of feelings
they all strike me at once
and my soul burning
i'm dying but still alive

When I finally find what i'm looking for
there's nothing there
just another meaningless question
why am i even here?

you may see me as a living creature
but i'm no more than a shadow
a forgotten spirit among others
wandering(Instrumental)Benedict, Brand, Kain, Korvin, Random, Erick, Gerard, Blaze, Julian: Who is to become the King of Amber? The body of their father who suddenly disappeared hasn't been found yet. The intestine war for the place on the throne the intrigues, the fratricide: Who will be the winner in this war?The majestic black goat
Seated in your gold throne
Arise of the asleep ashes,
Blown by the north's winds
Sadogoat!!!
Oh Belzebuth, rise of the cosmo's immensity!!!
Your majesty is the king of the emptiness,
Point us the precious scepter
Of your beautiful left hand
Blow your stormy sand
In our shameful faces
Oh, great God of the Flies,
Flap your beautiful wings
Magnificently in our direction, because we waited anxious for you,
Oh Monarch of All Gods, we hoped you remember this splendor
Hear our prayers and protect us eternally, take a bath with your fires and
furious howls, Oh Baphometic Beast!!!Suspended above, I weep below
Father... Father... I'm so sorry 
Your blood is on my hands 
I'm so sorry... 
I scream to my God... He has done nothing! 
He does not deserve this! 
It should have been me...
Fear not beloved, He died for you..(Instrumental)Not so long ago, there was a little boy
He was a fighter, a fighter, yes i said fighter
He endured and suffered, so far,
He became sad and left all he had
He had enough of life,
And disappeared from all landscapes
No-one is missing him,
But who should ever remember him?
Destiny was so harsh that he lost all hope
Survival, a fight he lost, one of hundreds
His will remained, but not strong enough
He once was a fighter, a fighter, yes i said fighter
He had enough of life,
And disappeared from all landscapesHere beside me, under endless howling winds
 My dying race is wandering homewards,
 Led by an old man to shores. That don't exist,
 Just emptiness remains...

 On and on goes our march gruesome as the
 Light of sun, cold as winds that hide in me

 Hour after hour, day after day my lullaby is
 Turning and falls gently on this sleeping land
 Like a hawk trembling of hunger and like a
 Burning source...

 Two years have passed and still my race is
 Wandering through foreign shores...
 Homewards...

 My soul is now formed as a knife forwards
 The heart of your heaven.
 And so I die...

 Still my folk keeps on marching...
 Homewards...you are your own enemy 
the power you seek is the power to oppose 
seize every opportunity 
where by itself is the source of problems 
your face is as a book 
where men may read strange matters 
your mind is a search engine 
to feed morbid curiosities in a virulent way 
fortune comes from unusual places 
if you ever believe in the unconventional 
let mind becomes the arch-captor 
entrance from this worn nonsense down into enigma 

[october 2012 - december 2013](Instrumental)An ill wind comes arising
Across the cities of the plain
There's no swimming in the heavy water
No singing in the acid rain
Red alert
Red alert

It's so hard to stay together
Passing through revolving doors
We need someone to talk to
And someone to sweep the floors
Incomplete
Incomplete

The world weighs on my shoulders
But what am I to do?
You sometimes drive me crazy
But I worry about you
I know it makes no difference
To what you're going through
But I see the tip of the iceberg
And I worry about you

Cruising under your radar
Watching from satellites
Take a page from the red book
Keep them in your sights
Red alert
Red alert

Left and rights of passage
Black and whites of youth
Who can face the knowledge
That the truth is not the truth?
Obsolete
Absolute

The world weighs on my shoulders
But what am I to do?
You sometimes drive me crazy
But I worry about you
I know it makes no difference
To what you're going through
But I see the tip of the iceberg
And I worry about you

Absalom! Absalom! Absalom!For the final journey, I have changed my destiny.
For the highest purpose, I have chosen the voyage,
VOYAGE TO THE REALM OF SMOKE

Claim of destiny to sift the hope...
In allure of death I will find the rope that shall collapse on my neck,
Through self-violation I see a silent gratification.
Why have my time left me alone?
Spasms of life will drive straight to the abyss
And the consolation of black grants the peak of bliss.
Why does the blood drowns in my howls?
Will the eternal emptiness cover the last resting place of my bones?
The harvester of decease with a gloomy smile on his face
Takes the vitality from the corpse...

The archangels stand along the path and croon the funeral chant,
And my final breath releases the horde of flies...
I ascend with this mighty hurricane!
The life force departs from my veins!
Approaching liberty welcomes the tormented soul.
The symphony of chaotic rays is burning my eyes...

The blackest light
Veils my sight,
I raise my hands.Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
they
they betray
I'm your only true friend now 
they 
they'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
you know it's sad but true

you're my mask
you're my cover, my shelter

you're my mask
you're the one who's blamed

do my dirty work, scapegoat

do my deeds
for you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
you know it's sad but true, sad but true

You know it's sad but true

I'm your pain when you can't feel

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm you

sad but truePray the only thing the priest will say
Pray and the world will be a better place

If you got a problem then come to church
In here you can pray them away
Let's sing a song about Jesus Christ
And then you will be saved

Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing

A few hours in the church
And you think that you have been saved
The priest just thinks of you as
Work

All your sins won't disappear
Just because he says they are gone
No they will always be
Forever

Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing

Pray the only thing the priest will say
Pray and the world will be a better place

If you got a problem then come to church
In here you can pray them away
Let's sing a song about Jesus Christ
And then you will be saved

Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothingCome forth O Demons of Darkness, muster the armies of hell 

It's time to break these bonds and crush the rusty church bells 

When will we rise? How long can we take this oppression? 

We see through their lies, Brick by brick, we'll burn their castles.... 

Down with their deception, down with their hypocrisy 

We laugh at their slanted half truths, twisted view of morality 

When will we rise? How long can we take this oppression? 

We see through their lies, Brick by brick, we'll burn their castles down 

The Sheep are gathered weekly to reinforce their fears 

The seeds of guilt are planted and watered with their tears 

The fires of hell burn before them to keep them all in line 

What sins of mortal man could merit torment 'til the end of time? 

Truthlessly, tipsy tyrants shall tiptoe through tulips 

As tactful tacticians tell their titillating tales 

Tyrants toke tobacco on the tailgates of travesty, taking time to take tolls from the tired 

Titans tackle the tiny and tasteless taglines toxify the tranquility of the timid 

Taxes are taken from temporal temples as tenacious temptation transpires 

Tenderfoot travelers treat tenants to tenderly....temporarily 

We soar on demons' wings into the storm 

and come to set the captives free 

From Dragon's flame fearless souls are born 

Meek hearts once blinded now can see 

The people rise to their feet, a long awaited battle draw near 

Their hearts are filled with hope, and the minds of the rulers are filled with fear....I soldiered to the top of the Acropolis
With you, my love, strapped to my chest

Before you saw year one,
you saw the Parthenon
And left a shark as a gift to the Gods

Your sleep evasion,
led to our nightly excursions
Through the cobbled mazes of Athens

You were startled by the barks of stray dogs,
echoing off the ancient agora walls

Thank the Gods of Olympus,
that taverna's lights were still lit
And the inn-keeper knew,
which direction was best

Before you saw year one,
you saw the Parthenon
And left a shark as a gift to the Gods(Instrumental)My mind's seizing a mental void
A while to carry myself to the imaginary self world
To escape from the sorrow-full reality
Of yesterdays feelings, another defeat. Materialistic tendencies
False faces. Vacant eyes
It's like-a safety value delivering me
From the dirty obsessive thoughts
A while to become a human scum again(Instrumental)Welcome to my inner circle...

as we speak for no tomorrow time avowed or death to be
what can fill out the mighty hollow descended to man possessed by fear

through our lives we search for treasures to put some sense into our life
but what we see is spectral preachers, morning stars and silent cries

optimism agonized by lives opponent, indifferent, repulsive lies

I was touched by the hand that heals and looked my saviour in her eyes

this Morgana in front of me gasping for breath I reach to the sky

I am formless but I see I lived a thousand times, set me free!!

I was touched by relieving hands and look my savious in his eyes
I can hear the tolling bells of a thousand sons will wish me well

I am formless but I see I lived a thousand times, set me free!!Mr. Jekyl, was Hyde your excuse to satisfy your urges?
The only way you could look at yourself in the broken mirror
And have a sense of humanity
Your faux pas creation
All along you're the monster, giving into your cravings
That murderous urge
But now its all gone wrong, and they know your identity
What will you do to save yourself?
Or are you still in denial of the beast you've becomePlaying dead with earnest, lend to the sigh 
Drowning in air with a propped up smile 
Consigned to the enclosure of a formal life 
To our thought all manner to deprive 

Conceded to a selfish dream 

The ceaseless senselessness of the lemming procession 
Redoubled deception, extending outwards 
In touch with the consensual avarice 
Dolled eyes rejoice in illusionsPrepare the spiny rubber glove

Now bend over!

OHHHHHHHH!!!!I'm never going to leave Coalinga
I love it here; it is my home
Also, I cannot get up
Or my bones willpuncture through my skin

Coalinga's off Highway Five
We make our living off motorist's cash
Dad sells 'em faulty road advice
Mom sells 'em rainbow colored ice

Hometown pride is like good bread
By that I mean the name
It sounds like a brand of bread
I don't want to leave, I wish I were dead!

Without a home, a man wonders the Earth
He is alone
In a wheelchair, I cannot do that
My bedpan is full, but I love my home

Coalinga! Show pride in Coalinga!
Coalinga! I cried in Coalinga!(Instrumental)Beholden, great deceiver 
Adorned by thorns and glorious fire 
Unholy are the words 
That you cast before your throne 

Beholden, great deceiver 
Draped in black and glorious slumber 
Unholy are the flames 
That you burn before your throne 

Disfigured wings with eyes as dead as night, 
I am you 
Called by the fire and held by the dark, 
I am you 
Destructive by nature you spit on the cross 
I am you 
Consumed by the hatred that we created 
I am you 

Let us burn in our fire and let us bleed by our words 
Deceive those who say they fear us and condemn those who say they don't 

Let us dwell on earthly desires and let us feast on heavenly flesh 
Illuminate those who call upon us and let them speak dead propheciesLast night I dreamed of darker things
In another place and time
Where angels flew with broken wings
And demons filled the sky
I dreamed we flew beyond
Our dismal world of fire and ice
We waged a war in heaven
And reclaimed our paradise

I dreamed of great atrocities
That filled my heart with joy
Our reign would be eternal
It could not be destroyed
We broke through heaven's pearly gates
The world from which we fell
We laid the holy throne to waste
And sent your savior.. straight to Hell

Apocalyptic horsemen
With violence on our minds
We will claim our judgement day
The world we left behind
We wait for armageddon
With bated breath
The bringers of destruction
Archangels of death

These gifts our father gave us
Sacraments of fire
These things that dreams are made of
To rule again our one desire
In another place... another time
Where dreams become reality
And pride is not a crime
We'll wage a war in heaven
To regain the world we lost
Paradise will be reclaimed
No matter what the cost
Our reign will be eternal
Dreams never die
On wings of victory we shall ever fly(Instrumental)Slipped in

But I fail to rememberDon't glimpse toward me, 
I'm not one to see, 
Disdain in those eyes anew, 
I bid thee, adieu, 
Dancing upon a teardrop, 
In celerity, please, stop.Crossed out from the list of the dead
You are born again for this world
Who begged for this?
Why are they causing you pain again?

Endless circulation of lives
Condemned to eternal anguish
Hope undying for ages,
Melting in the mist of rain and fog

The cramp of wheelwirk mechanisms 
Screams at which you loose your hope,
The hope for a calm prologue
To the realm of silence and emptiness

Endless circulation of lives
Condemned to eternal anguishI am your reason
I break your fall
I am your pleasure
I taste your soul

You want for nothing
I have it all
I give you pleasure
And so you will know

Thank me for mercy
I'll keep the flame
Get on your knees now
I'll show you pain

Thank me for meaning
I am your world
I am your pleasure
And so you will know

There's a cure in my pocket that I'm saving for a special day
There's a cure in my pocket that will make it all just go away

Can you hear me calling?
Can you see me falling?
Can you feel me hurting
In your mind?
I can tell this feeling
The pleasure is demeaning
But I know there's nothing
In your mind

Thank me for meaning
I am your world
I am your pleasure
And so you will know

There's a cure in my pocket that I'm saving for a special day
There's a cure in my pocket that will make it all just go away

Can you hear me calling?
Can you see me falling?
Can you feel me hurting
In your mind?
I can tell this feeling
The pleasure is demeaning
But I know there's nothing
In your mindMemory of the autumn sphere
Memory of the cheerful trips
Memory of the face of love
Of the warm fingertips

Memory of the darkened noon
Memory of the darkened woods
Memory of the words of love
Of the warnings, of the care

Memory of the gown of night
Memory of the solid dark
Memory of the fear of love
Of the rotten bark

Memory of the gap of death
Memory of the spiritual fall
Memory of the shape of love
Of the never ending fallI don't support
This state of violence
I need to scream
Loud my convictions

I refuse it
Noise is my violence
I fight for peace
Words are my weapons

 Life Slips Away
 As Demons Come Forth
 Death Takes My Hand
 And Captures My SoulI will have blood...

Blood! Break open your skull, open up your veins
Blood! In spates across my feet, against my face
Blood! There's not enough in the universe to overflow my tongue

Black! The stars are blotted out, clouds covering clouds
Black! Darkness vibrant, sonant in the roaring, whirling wind
Black! You are nothing, nothing is all, all is nothing

Kali, Kalimata! Fire in the heart, black o'ertake the mind
Kali, Kalimata! Can you hear the bells which remain unstruck?

Fire! Raining down like stones from the broken sky
Fire! Pulsing through my arms, pouring from my hands
Fire! Reclaim the night, usher you back to hell
Fire! The price is everything you have to give

From every drop of blood is sprung another snake
Each as terrible as the next
Tooth and writhing tongue devouring all you see
Every stroke brings on another
Thousand foes, and you think your dominance complete
But the shadow itself springs to life
Relieving the burden of your head
And sucking down every precious
Drop of blood you had relied upon
See your head in my hands
Watch your own body fall lifeless
Cower as the universe trembles before me
Die in fear as my dance destroys all creation
Not even Shiva...

Kali, Kalimata! Essence of the night, fire in the heart, black o'ertake the mind
Kali, Kalimata! Can you hear the bells which remain unstruck?

The stars are blotted out, clouds are covering clouds
It is darkness vibrant, sonant
In the roaring, whirling wind are the souls of a million
Lunatics just loosed from the prison house
Wrenching trees by the roots
Sweeping all from the path
The sea has joined the fray
And swirls of mountain waves, to reach the pitchy sky
A flash of lurid light reveals on every side
A thousand, thousand shades of death begrimed
Black scattering plagues, and sorrows dancing mad with joy
Come oh Mother, come!
For terror is thy name, death is in thy breath
And every shaking step destroys a world forever
Thou time, the all-destroyer
Come oh Mother, come!

Come oh Mother, come
Who dares misery love, and hug the form of death
And dance in destruction's dance, to him the Mother comes
To him the Mother comesSomething inside me 
It's, it's coming out 
I feel like gettin' 
the funk down to this beat 

My parents were from Boulder, Colorado 
They thought I looked cutest in a wheelchair 
So they got me one and said I was disabled 
When really all I wanted was to dance 

Only behind closed doors 
Can I take my feet to the dance floor 
I can walk, I can slide 
I can lay a whoopin' on ya hide 
So miss me 
With ya ableist shit 
It ain't like I can't get wid it 
Maybe everyone's just like me 
Forced into sedentariness by hippies 

Born to be free 
Feet flailing under me 

And also I never liked 
Organic gluten-free food 
GMOs are good for you, 
Boulder's just really dumbThat which lies beyond
Open your eyes, awaken your senses
This I show you, now you shall see
And it will change, your world forever

See to beyond
Past perception and physical senses

We shall fall into the worlds beyond the veil

Entranced by the turning vortex
Its visions of splendour entice me
But yet there are things
Which I do not know or have ever seen
A portal opens
I fall far, far down
Amongst the ones
Who call for me.

Behold! This being gliding with form
Yet no form
Transfixed yet horrified by this angelic enigma
Run! It senses us. It feels us
It's coming
Can it cross the worlds' divide?
Will we escape it?

Wait, there is more than this
Yes, there is terror beyond known terror
But all we have done
Must not be lost
We shall step into the light(Instrumental)"i can picture in my mind a world without war
a world without hate
and i can picture us attacking that world
beacuse they'd never expect it"Right now
I feel it surge
The hatred that renders me pure
Restoring The disdain
Once lost but now come forth!


For i see
Great visions
Of cataclysm
For i see
Great catastrophes
In my favor, in my name




Sacrifices to me
For i am the new god
the true creator
great masses for me
The new lord
messiah of reality



Trampled now
Are the ways of christ
Broken down his weak sign
The cross 
such a feeble throne
It doth burn in its own hell


Jesus and his flock
Sheered, skinned, and bleed
Bleed of ignorance
Bleed of life!



Sacrifices to me
For i am the new god
the true destroyer
great masses for me
The new lord
messiah of reality

My peers my subject
fade into the world, unknown
you walk among, the heretics
you walk among the strong

The weak the slave race
destined to follow our every command
I, fallen one, master of the great abyss
do call this a new dawn, and new beginning, the right millenniumThe gnostic texts, ancient, depending on
canonical gospels. Questionable are these
works for they too were written by man from
the alternative voice of Christ. Orthodox
and heresy depict a world of mysteries soon
to be destroyed by the hierarchical church.

Preceding the heretics, a revelation! A history
has been written. Documents of Christian
antiquity. A revelation! Scars of the saints.

The scholars flounder in ignorant darkness
and bygone are the decades of truth relying
on a vision of control that will flourish
through a world of the misleading. Look
into the eyes of the saints and see their
scars for those who have witnessed. A
miracle dawn is coming, the cynics say.
Come forward now. If I hadn't believed it
I wouldn't have seen it.

Destructor 

From a race and place unknown 
One ton of hair, teeth, muscle, and bone 
The savage lord of a bygone age 
A broken hulk on a carnival stage 
The people screamed, the whip cracked 
Bloody lashes on his quivering back 
A broken chain; pantaloons pissed 
The sickening crunch of his pitiless fists 

Through the murk of the stygian swamp 
Came the sound of a thundering stomp 
The wretched beast collapsed to the ground 
As the Swamp Hag came to check on the sound 
She gave him succor, she tended his wounds 
He made a nest in a crumbling tomb 
Every night he would come out to feast 
Clawing at the graves of the newly deceased 

Solo Digestor 

The scent of blood perfumed the air 
Into the catacombs 
The monster lumbered, unaware 
Spiked fist, iron claw 
A sucker-punch to his powerful jaw 
Clashing giants, thundering blows 
Fermentor pitched in with a drum solo 

Core breach; coolant aboil 
Belching black smoke; vomiting oil 
A mighty club to a cast iron hull 
Transplanted brain liquified in its skull 
System failure, tubes were blown 
Two tons of steel dropped like a stone 
Massive damage, Killbot was fucked 
=Initiate sequence: Self Destruct=Grown from a vision of a kind that we become one's in a lifetime
such a marvelous landscape of reality

helpless the feeling I was almost forgotten
as it was in a riddle in a rhyme
the only thing I can say is: it used to be existence of a luminous darkness

what went wrong.... where did we lose our path?
What has become of humanity?

Environmental pollution, explosive overpopulation,
annihilated ozone layer, famine
dramatic climate changes, destroyed natural surroundings,
all enough to explode the evolutionary bomb

what went wrong.... where did we lose our path?
What has become of humanity?
A new rodl is forming a new kind of man is born here
paralyzed masses predestine to live their life suffering

see nothing.... hear nothing.... locked up in their own tears
see nothing.... hear nothing.... locked up in their own tears
See nothing! Hear nothing! Locked up in their own tears
See nothing! Hear nothing! Locked up in their own tears

Locked up in their own tears!
And now I'm here after my laborious expedition
through the impenetrable woods of human slime
and I see that we the herd have not learned
from our failures, failures of childhood

I  have to say farewell to the battered children,
overgrown by ravages of time
so that my will and mind become stronger
after the decision to depart from this life and it's deceptive 
lies
blessed are the oppressedWhat shall we do with the drunken sailor,
What shall we do with the drunken sailor,
What shall we do with the drunken sailor,

We strike from the air
When Lucifer's at war
A people turns gore

Shock and awe
The Beast likes it raw
Do What Thou Wilt
Is the whole of their Law

You better not be here
We kill from the air
Satan's war on terror
The darkest night of horror

Shock and awe
The Beast likes it raw
Do What Thou Wilt
Is the whole of their Law

Shock & Awe

Medals for the dead
We honour your fall
A body bag for the blood you shed
Soldier, you gave it all

Shock & Awe

Medals for the dead
America honours your fall
A body bag for the blood you shed
Soldier, you gave it all

Shock & Awe

Whichever side you're on
It hurts to lose a son
Satan's war on terror
The darkest night of horror

Do What Thou Wilt
Is the whole of their Law

Shock & Awe
(repeat)Meaningless in heaven, indifferent in Hell 
Lost faith the last siege of soul 
Wake from a nightmare and realize 
The waking world is much worse 

Tomorrow, today's everything will disappear 
Primordial fear 
A funeral mushroom cloud blankets us all 
A death shroud 

The minds eye forever grey 
Appalled by weakness 
Applaud our Holy deficit(Instrumental)The peace, the bird, the lake
My moment of truth
My moment of facing my lies
My moment of unconscious understanding

Why am I here?
Who is with me?

The shores are empty
The islands are empty
No streams or waves
Just the open sea
Calm like me

Only the light
From the above

The light is glowing, glowing, reaching me
The rings are growling, growling, reaching me
The fear is coiling, coiling, reaching me(Instrumental)I know the way to Hell. 

Glacial nights and days that burn 
seem far more appetizing than Earth. 
I just wanna be left alone. 

We all take the way to Hell. 

Glacial nights and days that burn 
seem far more appetizing than Earth. 
I just wanna be left alone. 

I want to see the sun rise on Jupiter. 
I want to die on Mars. 
I can't hate anyone. I don't want to be loved. 
I just want to be left alone. 

I want to leave and not be followed. 
I want to be hated because I can't love anyone. 
I want to be left alone. 

I just wanna be left alone. 
I wanna die on Mars.Fat and ugly
She is formed to suffer
Dirty inside
Indulging in a mental rape
Unwanted
Dirty bitch
She is faithful to the end
Like a dying dog

Angelica burns
Old remembrance
Of beautiful moments
And unique ones
Her words are dim now
But my dream still returns
But I am the same

In shade of the streets
Chased by her life
She lost her best days
Days of youth
Frightened of passing away
And fading beauty
Why did she go there?
Why...

We are naked
Striding on the path of sorrow
When we look backwards
We only see darkness
Aimlessly...
Life is only a misunderstanding
And if you are nobody,
You life isn't needed

Your moment is passing
And will never come back
You perfectly know, it's time
Your escape doesn't make sense
You name will be forgotten
And then your face will vanish
But I'll mention you sometimes
The voice from the past will come backA monstrosity! 
This being has forgotten the value of existence. Venom rushing through his veins fuel this abomination of man. The self inflicted horror cursing all that cross paths with this spineless parasite. The pain, the seclusion. An ambuscade led by delusion. Lies are exposed by the profound sadness within his eyes. Lacerations within his soul sever away at his delectable disposition. Lacerations within his soul sever away at his delectable disposition. Leaving behind an abandoned life-form begging for revitalization. Stomach tight, he can't stop pushing, deliberation of his abdomen discharging. THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL!  Constantly searching for a way to escape the misery of reality. Suddenly awakened from this demoniac nightmare euphoria storms my spirit. RAWR! Staying as free as it gets, forever. Staying as free as it gets, forever.Slowly I climb - thoughts lost to time - the drug takes meIf I had a little time to empathize
On how the Earth suffers the most
Tortured landscapes and dying forests
Witnessing the quality of mankind

Greed, corrupted minds
Perversion, misled goals
Something wrong here...

Life's not an imaginary time sequence
A reality line which forms the chronicles of our deeds
From birth time to our demise we spend
Our days of irresponsibility

Our civilizations continue to bottom-line
the plagues of Earth that emphasize its severe conditions
History proved it
No one can escape from this fact!

Desperately - seeing our corrupted world
Done by hands - that help build and destroy
Who's to blame - for all degeneration?
Inside us - we are longing for the Truth

Longing for truth!

Crying in confusion
Who will save this world
...from its destruction?(Instrumental)I live because I die everyday
Where Nergal put your wisdom

Horizons of abysses in harmony
Shades of the brave, end of war

In direction to the North or the South
I know that I will find Goddesses of Solitude,
Midnight arrives, I will have Luna
In the mortal winds, I will go

Always in dialogue with the stars
Shine and darkness!!!
Never cry for me
I'm the living dead in the summer landsWriting in silence
Contemplating the ruins this earth
We pray, we love, we hope
We sail without rest and without a guide

How long this world will have to suffer
Could the stars guide us?
Follow me the sea lane that never was ended
We sing ancient rimes

We cross dark clouds imagine the moon again
My goddess all my eyes are for you

Fallen tears from this darkened sky (Darkened sky)
Sweetest dew on my skin (On my skin)
Mighty lord thank you for this rain For this rain)
Washing all away from our sorrow

How we were stupid selfish too
Always centered on us
Forgetting unlucky people around us
So blind to dream all resources to
Reduce our planet in ashes
When we will learn from our mistakes
Maybe one day we'll return to dream

We cross dark clouds imagine the moon again
My goddess all my eyes are for you

Fallen tears from this darkened sky (Darkened sky)
Sweetest dew on my skin (On my skin)
Mighty lord thank you for this rain For this rain)
Washing all away from our sorrow


Fallen tears from this darkened sky (Darkened sky)

Sweetest dew on my skin (On my skin)
Mighty lord thank you for this rain For this rain)
Washing all away from our sorrow(music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras)

I see you coming in your sunday dress 
gotta feeling our meeting's gonna be a mess
As you start talking, I keep on walking
hoping my good star will keep me from...

...Tying a rope round your neck and
putting hundred scorpions under your skin
Break your fingers one by one
and feel the sound of your bones all night long

//chorus 1
I don't need your appreciation
your disguise and your fuckin' celebration
I don't need your appreciation
I just need you to stay miles away from me

All you gave me last Xmas was a packet
C-c-c-c-covered with lies
Think once... or better think twice
next time there'll be no one to keep me from...

...setting your house on fire and
Throwing a punch right at your face
having private rock'n'roll with your girl
to feel the sound of her voice all night long

//chorus 1 

//chorus 2
I don't need your appreciation
the heavy weight of your fuckin' invitations
I don't need your appreciation
I just need you to stay miles away from me

What is cool is miles from you
I gotta tell you baby, I gotta tell you
You make me laugh, you make me cry
so please get away... from my eyes
I wanna see you run in march 3.5
I still smell the stench of your lies
You make me laugh, you make me cry
so please get away... from my eyes

//chorus 1

//chorus 2A journey with my spirit to an other place
A place to be, a place that is not yet.

A place where emotions take control
A place for freedom, liberty and creation.

This so called place
Is deep in your own
Like a little boy,
We have to learn

A journey to a place with divinity
And with magnificence

A place where knowledge and ability
Does not matter, only reality.

This so called place
Is deep in your own
Like a little boy,

We have to learnUs in the state of constant change.
Conservatism has lost its meaning.
Left behind all lies and deceit.
Us in a carrier, driven one way forward.

Purity's an illusion, life has its proof.
To one's heart's content, openness upsurged.
Sustain singularity within set patterns.
Let us blend!

Together we stand, as a fusion of styles,
the magic of colors, alluring dynamics,
where differences made new pathways.
Let us blend!

Shall we attain hybrid sophistication,
piercing right into the core of being?
Our character shall be preserved
even in an absence of homogeneity.You need my love baby, oh so bad
You're not the only one I've ever had
And if I say I wanna set you free
Don't you know you'll be in misery

[Chorus]
They call me (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love)

And even though I'm full of sin
In the end you'll let me in
You'll let me through, there's nothin' you can do
You need my lovin', don't you know it's true

So answer please get on your knees
There are no bills, there are no fees
Baby, I know what the problem is
The first step of the cure is... a kiss

[Chorus]
So call me (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)
I am your doctor of love (calling Dr. Love)

Ha!
They call me (Dr. Love), they call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love)

[Solo]

Ooh, they call me (Dr. Love)
I am the doctor of love (calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love)

Ooh, they Call me (Dr. Love)

I've got the cure you're thinking of (calling Dr. Love), yeah

Yeah, they call me (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love)
Love, love, love, (Dr. Love)
Love, love, love, love, (calling Dr. Love) love Dr. Love

I've got the cure you're thinkin' (Dr. Love)
I've got the cure you're thinkin' (calling Dr. Love)
Oh-aw, I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (Dr. Love)
They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)
I've got the cureDown here I wait with all my benthic friends
Underneath the gate listening to lives end
Those with seven gills will investigate each thunderous crash and corresponding shape
In great detail, I described you to them
In case the bridge is how you choose to end
I'd like to have some last words with you before you end up on the Farallone's rocky shores
Where the real beasts await to have their way
With all the failures washed out from the bay
A hundred years have past since just last autumn
Please come to the bay, see who now lives on the bottom
I'd like to have some last words before I forget how to walk upon these muddy shores and entirely cease to breathe like a man
Seeing things only with the tips of my hands
My heart is crushed by the jaws of regret
Upon knowing where you now make your bed
The depths at which I've chained to you
I pray those shackles eventually rust through
Held under by chiton like lies
Amongst the corpses
I'll never surface
Debris bouncing off my hide
Covered in detritus I've lost purpose
What comfort lies in years of hating me?
Haven't you in some way found a rare peace?
Please realize your very soul's at stake you're still a man and I was just a tool of fate
Your bite marks riddled my soul
It got damn cold with all those holes
So I left it on shore for all the gulls
Take it
There wasn't much left
Take it
Bit it's all yours
Take itWeak spineless bastard
God among the weak
You are far from who you claim to be

I know your game and I know how to play it too
No reason to fight I am stronger I am faster
I am wiser superior to you
I know your game and I know how to win it too
Now you are mine for the rest of your life
and beyond I will suffer your soul

You played with fire
Hells energy
I am that fire, Hells energy

I know your game and I know how to play it too
No reason to fight I am stronger I am faster
I am wiser superior to you
I know your game and I know how to win it too
Now you are mine for the rest of your life
and beyond I will suffer your soul

Suffer the soul.

Trapped in here for eternity
Your soul belongs to me
Trapped in here for eternity
Always here with me

Suffer the soul, suffer the soul
Suffer the soul, suffer the soul

Weak spineless bastard
God among the weak
You are far from who you claim to be

I know your game and I know how to play it too
No reason to fight I am stronger I am faster
I am wiser superior to you
I know your game and I know how to win it too
Now you are mine for the rest of your life
and beyond I will suffer your soulFrom the ancient days of earth, we Grothians were around 
There were lots of plants and critters but no good food could be found 
So we took earth's brightest DNA and combined it with our own 
And that's how tasty humans were grown 

Through the pages of your history books we've worked behind the scenes 
We made sauces from your fat ones to add more flavor to the lean 
But in the quest for flavor, one truth has passed the test 
Organic Free Range Vegans taste the best! 

Once we had our recipe, our agents went to work 
We put vegan shows on Netflix, made the ranchers look like jerks 
Then we softened up our specimens with mellow indie tunes 
And now we cut their tender meat with spoons! 

The taste of these fine morsels is orgasmic I confess 
Organic Free Range Vegans taste the best! 

We did not want them sinewy from working for their keep 
We did not make them warriors since the recipe calls for sheep 
We taught them war was evil, and all you need is love 
And now they are as harmless as doves! 

So if you ever get real hungry and beef wont do the trick 
Just head on down to HipsterCon with a machete, and be quick!
If they sense your intentions there's bound to be a mess 
Organic Free Range Vegans Taste the best 

Slightly better than the rest, admittedly I do confess...I'm a guardian, I'm a guardian at the gates of witchery
I'm the envoy, I'm the envoy of unhuman nature
I'm searching, I'm searching for the eyes of enemy
Til the dawn come, til the dawn come I will stand immortally.

*People pushing at my side
Less than pity live their lives*.

Mighty armies, mighty armies coming to invade our land
Countless millions, countless millions trampling ground under feet
Stony souls, stony souls ain't got nothing to defeat
Empty handed, empty handed their will turn back in their home.

post-industrial working class
Empowered by commands to be

I feel trapped here within
their system as the workforce

Diligent and industrious
Voluntarily focused
Disciplinary in use
Slaves of this modern world

I feel trapped here within
their system as the workforce

Beyond reasonable doubt
Strains coincide with fear
Harder still to make a will
and sacrifice our surviving selves

Here our lives, on their hands as an asset
Stagnation walks in circular direction
Lack of inclination
Self-induced submission
Undisputable fracture

"I can see clearly now the rain is gone..."

DIE!!!As we exist on this sinister plane
It seems as if there is no refuge to claim
Everywhere, stench of death, doom in disguise
And either we give in or rise up and fight
This apathy, this loss of our humanity
We must wake up...

Take heed, open your heart
Don't let go, it's not over yet
We live not to destroy, but only to get back home
With stifled breath, and callously conditioned heart
We reach for death, as sacred ties are torn apart
Could we be sleepwalking through waking life
Our lives on autopilot, all day and night
All day and night

There is only one way out
Everything else is a monstrous lie

And so, what have you earned from your constructs?
Justification of falling prey to blindness
Turning your eyes away will never make things right
One day you too may need a guiding light

Everyday is another day to turn your back...
Everyday is another day to help those who...
Everyday is another day to turn your back on...
Everyday is another day to help those who need you
Everyday is another day to turn your back
Everyday is another chance to live or die
It's your choice

Wake up, wake up
Before it's too late

The fog rolls in on an empty street
No voices, no noise or shuffling feet
Regret hanging heavy in the air
The morning greets you, wrought by despair
The moment grips you, no way to break free
Breathe in the sting of reality
A solemn vow to make amends
Reflect, heal and begin again

There is only one way in which one can endure man's inhumanity to man, and that is to try, in one's own life, to exemplify man's humanity to man.

There is only one way out
Everything else is a monstrous lie(Eklundh)

This is some kind of love song
I can't find the words, I was born wrong
Girl, I've been trying for so long
This is some kind of love song 
I'd like to kiss you, but I'm much too shy
My lips ain't working, no matter how I try
I'd like to whisper sweet words in your ear
But when I'm trying you pretend you don't hear

You say I have to play unplugged
Just like they do on MTV
Well, I got six strings on my guitar, girl
But I need electricity 

This is some kind of love song
I can't find the words, I was born wrong
Girl, I've been trying for so long
This is some kind of love song

Rented a limo to pick you up from work
But you didn't see me, I felt like a jerk
I bought you flowers so you would be impressed
Then you're allergic, well, I should have guessed

Then I made dinner to surprise you
But when you got here you already ate
Then I invited you to the movie
My car freaked out, and I was late 

De Niro had to wait...

Unknown words whispered in dark now become my tool for evil. These oils and herbs on my skin create the aura of malice. Abstract mist, transparent eyes. Invicible power in this other realm. You can't see me, I can touch you. Your real soul, naked and bloody... All in my hands, all so beautiful, all so vunerable, all so sacrificial! I have charmed you all, hollow ecstasy in your minds. I dissect your body and soul - Meet me on the other side. Abstract mist, transparent eyes. Invicible power, in this other realm...(...)

You won't reach your bloody home

In the end you'll die and face the shame
Just surrender, let us win this gameIn the garden of the gods...
Under the blood stained smile of Kali
In the Temple of Flesh (In the Temple of Flesh)
We learned the meaning of ecstasy

No stained glass windows to hide beneath
No sins to be confessed (confess! confess!)
We surrendered guilt for pleasure
In the Temple of Flesh

She came to me like a bitch in heat
She went down on her knees and she
Kissed my feet.. she kissed every part 
of me she wanted to bless...
She came to me in the Temple of Flesh
She prayed like a saint with the words of a whore
Then we fucked like tigers on the temple floor

No goddess of love
No ethereal deity
No vestal virgins in the Temple of Flesh
She's the daughter of Kali

A dark dangerous path but here we are
In the valley of death (in the valley of death)
No return from the temple of fleshI feel the blade inside. It rips deep in my flesh. My heart is not prepared for what awaits me. Shall I fear for my existence, yet it means nothing? Shall I shake until I fall like a leaf into cowardice? Shall I be so vain as to call this mine? Shall I fall into outrecuidance and surrender to this world? The corpse of temptation into ashes... scattered in darkness... that consumes the sun. Bring life to my soul.

Wash your wounds with salt and sand. No matter how clean you are, you'll never be clean enough. Your feet pollute the ground. Your breath poisons the air. Your body's best described with words better left unsaid. You're more than half dead. No, you can never be clean enough - but still, come wash your wounds in this stream, where as a child you would sit and dream, though dreams aren't strong enough. Your day has come and gone. Stand in the circle, naked to the waist, locked in your own embrace, wallowing in filth. Remain under the water till it once again runs clear, and takes you far from here. At your approach, the earth would shift. Leaves scatter to the sky. Grass and flowers die. I praise your name with a million voices, raised in a song of shame, to keep the dead in the ground, your body on the ground, your face held to the ground, while I hammer the nail through. Then later, I'll wash your wounds with salt and sand. Oh, how you lay there, king of birds and stones. Oh, how you lay there, graceless and cold, a shell, a piece of meat. You stabbed the sacred heart. You bit the sacred hand. You'll die in your own shit, but first you'll live in pain. No matter how you wash, you'll never be clean again."There are none so enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free." - The Truth shall set you free - The Babylonian Brotherhood - We are their Protocols of the Elders of Zion - The Great Work of Ages - The Brotherhood Agenda - The Media, Military, Science, Religion - Are all Brotherhood created and controlled - Creations designed to divide and conquer the human race. - Secret societies - Ancient races of interbreeding bloodlines - They use human fear as energy - Thus we have the encouragement of wars - Human genocide, paedophilia, the mass slaughter of animals, sexual perversions - Anunnaki, Nordics, Aryans - We are the Children of the Matrix - An illusion designed to keep you in a cell - Orchestrated by forces beyond this realm. - "All truth goes through three stages. - First it is ridiculed. - Then it is violently opposed. - Finally it is accepted as self-evident." - It's just a game. - It's just a ride.

My only sin is contemplate her infinite beauty,
And I'm afraid because ye zealous,
Snatch away the gift of her look.

No pain, no gain, our toxic love is eating us away
Our toxic love is eating us alive

They got sick love, toxic love
A twisted hurricane from above
Two souls bound in sense and terror
They wander the world and they carry chaos, yeah
They got sick love, toxic love
A twisted hurricane from above
Two souls bound in sense and terror
They wander the world and they carry chaos, yeah
Sex and sensibility, this is not reality, it's just toxic loveBeyond the Threshold of Circular Metamorphosis


...And in sudden flash of realization, I was dead, 
and the world became alive...
Writhing , sprawling with an intense will to exist, 
an infantile hunger for the yet to be seen.
This was me, and I was it, a dried out husk of passed mortality,
and I embraced it, longful and welcoming.

Dancing within illegible patterns, 
I reveal what is unknown to me.

Whatever lies beyond cannot be understood 
by the likes of those who rule.

Lord of change, distant memory.

An eternal spiral of hate and desire.
To master it is the key to...What?

Purifying the condemned,
Putrefying the catastophic.

Emotions do not exist, 
they died long ago...
Your concienceness is my playground,
your mind is my chamber of torture

The conjuration
The magnitude
The grieving of our mindless existece.
"Greeneyed jester, i mock thee, thou art the plague of this world"
The pathways to mortality conceil themselves whitin the ruptured remains of desire

Rigid/smooth
Shattered/complete
I am it all.

Plaguing me like a pair of blazing eyes 
that hide wherever i cannot see them.
Beholding my every physical move,
analyzing whatever hidden emotions i might wield.

Dark existence, in the shadow of the profane....(Instrumental)Blossoming creation of chemical reaction, 
 Equa-distant in radius from one's... 
 Ancestral descent in the grand circle of life. 
 Advancing identically in the scheme of time. 
 ...Until the direction of said circle is diverted. 
 Elliptical and opening, I see behind the curtain. 

 Violet, pulsating elegance captivating, 
 Fluorescent capsule glistening. 
 Encased in glass. Tethered by cords. 
 Despite valiant effort, I haven't much time. 
 My preservation is indefinite. 
 I slowly reveal the whites of my eyes, 
 Frailty detected. 

 An inclination so completely resolute. 
 Slowly migrating 
 Into my destitution. 

 Remembering 
 Life, astonishing---Rich with bold color--- 
 Each splash of water, every drop unique. 
 Endless meadows of green, 
 Specific strands of grass chosen with no two identical blades ever to be found here. 

 Status 
 Declining. Convulsing frantically. 
 Insect - akin sporadic movements. 
 Imply my conclusion must be near. 
 Release the neck's tension, I lay my head back to die. 

 Supported by my own body's buoyancy, 
 I float within semi-liquid glop, 
 Inside the vacuole of foreversleep. 
 Black. Cold. Pulsating. 

 A knot in the throat and a grit of the teeth, a massive, abundant endorphin release. 
 Will I dream or will thought cease? 
 This is it. I've waited my entire life for this very moment. 
 To feel nothing. To be nothing. To be removed from the ellipse... perchance to begin again.I was looked for a long time to ransom all my crimes
To forgive my mortal sins - to repent in endless night
Where I belong is land of tears - where I live is necroville
In empty space I lost the time and darkness comes into my mind
All is black and all is cold - that is the place where I belong
I belong in land of tears - I live in necroville
No one's alive just blood and fear - alive and dead in necroville
But for my life I need your bloodThrow yourself
Into the vessel of possibilities
Your green muse
The apparatus for soul mobility
A gateway to secrecy

[Official translation:
(Title: Regina Of The Blessed Moon)

Ages passed...
When light of day had flickered out Dark wind has blown in my doorstep 
Ardently plundering brightness
I'm damping by silence remote hope
Borning unsubdued fear
Time to rise head last time
Before eyelids will descend without echo
Ominous fog is hurting vision
Emptiness visiting my home
I can hear moan of ailing violin
Firefly temple in panic dance
Melody is stronglin by jeering laughter
Highest time to fade away(Instrumental)Down and down in a downward spiral
The choice never simple and
The jokes of a mind that was freezing inside
A loneliness not to tend to
Like a long time ago
Long time ago
I guess you know

Down and out I got to it again
A habit so hard to break
When all of a sudden a flower popped up
And said to me "come again"
Like I did all along
Just all along
You should have known

It didn't take a lot of time
I was driven crazy yes I lost my mind
Coz all I ever seen was the dream of your love
Yes all I've seen, this dream of you
Around me cynic laughter
To me, ain't nothing new

It's all inside my head, and it keeps on coming back
Coz all I ever seen was the dream of your love
Yes all I've seen, this dream of you
Around me cynic laughter, anything was gloom

Over and over the mountain trails
My heart would be lighter then
So fuck with the story and fuck with the lad
I'm on my own once again
Like a long time ago, as you have known

It's gonna take a little lot o'time
It's all inside my head
Yes all inside my head, but it keeps on coming back
It keeps on coming back
I just can't spend it, all this time thinking of youScreaming as the torch is lit
The muscles seize as hooks are thrust
Into your writhing torso twisting
Metal up your fucking butt

Spill your guts!
Spill your fucking guts!

Veiny ropes of innards dripping
Shit and blood from jagged cuts
Are ripping from a nauseating
Racket as I spill your guts

Gnawing at your stomach
In the offal splattered dirt
Sopping up the drippings
With your Iron Reagan shirt

Sneakers stolen and your vest is
Tattered where your ribcage juts
From under ravaged flesh now aren't you
Happy that you spilt your guts?Why did you do it
You bloody moron
Put an end to your problems
By killing innocents

Time cannot be turned
But shootings be averted
There is a way out of it
The gun is not that way

We could have protected you
If only you had asked
We could have saved you
But you chose destruction

Sturmgeist 89
Why did you do it

So you selfish bastard
In Hades or Valhalla
I'll iterate my question
Why did you do it

Now I'll be their villain
Sturmgeist 77
Because of your murders
The nine lives that you took

Natural selector
What a bunch of bull
Your victims were innocent
You chose them at random

This world is full of garbage
You didn't make it better
Never will a suicide
Resurrect the victims

We could have protected you
If only you had asked
We could have saved you
But you chose not to believe

Sturmgeist 89
Why did you do it

So you selfish bastard
In Hades or Valhalla
I'll demand an answer
Why did you do it

Sturmgeist 89
Why did you do itThick, dark, dim, stale 
Coughing stagnant breath 

Belching smoke into the sky 
As it gorges on air 
Turning life-force into death 
Stopping the will for existence 

Wailing tenants, and snaps of wood 
Are the sounds of the end, that no life persists 

Thicker, darker, blinding 
Coughing sour blood 

Get down on the floor and crawl 
Until your lungs give out on you 

Who would have thought 
Such a glow 
Radiant and 
Their end is slowStanding tall
and crushing on
through the biting and bitter cold...
these are the only coals that still burn,
the undying tinder of
defiant survival,

that glow with a primal strength
steadily in a cyclic
rhythm of determination
overwhelming the bloody
gates of opposition.

hurtling through the night
like a stone that won't stop
thrashing into dawn
with a searing fever
time wanes, eyes red
in search of alleviation
tearing the will
for a gleam of solace

To the horizon
all sights affixed, ablaze
beset by scavengers
dancing with a reeling hunger
but they inspire no fear
or hatred
only pitied laughter thrown at
their feeble posturing.

And the wind of solemn anguish,
once a gnawing pain lashed upon
what was left
exposed
to feel it's kiss
now a welcome breeze
beckoning
like a frozen mistress

To the horizon
all sights affixed, ablaze
beset by scavengers
dancing with a reeling hunger
but they inspire no fear
or hatred
only left standing tall and
holding on to these cherished embers
carried all the way to the funeral pyre
in calloused palms, and calloused minds
the sustenance that will not tire
blizzards seek no forgiveness
and whip without cruelty
facing the storms would be a lot easier
completely numb
although, it's nice to be warmWhere do you hide now doorknocker
Was my door the end of your Jehovah crusade?
I wish you would come back to die again
I miss the feeling of my fist bashing your face

Why don't you come back to insult me again
So I can crucify you as I did last time
Oh please doorknocker knock on my door
So I can split your bible in two as before

Doorknocker why do you hide from me
I miss to give you pain visit me

You promised me suffering from God's hands
Where are the sufferings? Hiding as you Jehovah
I told you hell would conquer
It looks like I am right and you are wrong again

Doorknocker why do you hide from me
I miss to give you pain visit me

Open my house door
Enter my house whore
Behind enemy lines
Your words will not help

Come back to me
Try to turn me
Speak your words

Come back to me
So I can hurt you
And hurt you yes I will

Open my house door
Enter my house whore
Behind enemy lines
Your words they will not help

I miss your screams for help
I miss your fear for me
I miss to give you pain
I miss the torturingHoly blood, a gift of overwhelming grace, only for those who abase themselves and kneel at your command. One nation under fools who've forgotten how to stand. You're crawling in a circle, chained inside since birth. Fall inwards from this point? You'll never reach the earth. There's nothing at the center: no god, no soul. A blind, voiceless mouth, opening to the sky at random. Suck down the shit nourishment you sought from above. Your father's house has many rooms, but no room there for me. When I stand outside the walls, your iron gates seem weak. Give me bread and coin, and lock the door behind, focused inward on the divine. Stay in that circle till you rot. Standing at this height, no miracle of mind, but a circle made of lies, where the deaf entrap the blind. There's nothing at the center.Soccer mom hatred

You fracture will be
Complete
My reign will shine

Gods cannot beat us
Gods cannot defeat us

Like a snake with a new skin
With the same eyes
I'm standing in front of you
To break the lies
The ghost of my dishonour
Will haunt your nights
For all the screams I swallowed
You'll lose your pride

Gods cannot beat us
Gods cannot defeat us

All the pain that I endured
Was the shade in your mirror

I'm drinking at your veinsI die. Where will I go when I die? 
We'll I'll tell you where the hell I'd like to be. 
Where will I go when I die? 
I've entered the darkest place I've ever been, 
filled with fossils of my sins. Petrified I've risen well beyond my means, 
Struck by the darkness holy light. Could these cave paintings be right? 
guide my hand to blade and march me off to die. 
Did my time in this earthly rubble, killed more men than I care to trouble. 
Feel this shrinking noose of guilt tied around my neck, 
I wage a war on myself. They've put me here in a cell, the padded walls feel like 
Hell. If I was cured could they even tell. 
Right here in a frozen world, born to bleed just like me. 
Stand in line and wait to die, washed away on that dark day. 
Food for thought or so we thought, pissed away that bitter taste 
soldiers hands covered in wine. Who's to say they're out of line?
Flash of red now your dead, face that facts your maker said. 
In the ground you keep your lies. Spread the ash in disbelief toss away your 
empty grief and one of these days we all must depart. 
What the hell are we fighting for? 
On and on the Blackleaf grows, up and down in perfect rows. 
Symmetry is for the dead, know one knows how long we have left so 
Right here in a frozen world, born to bleed just like me. 
Stand in line and wait to die, washed away on that dark day. 
Food for thought or so we thought, pissed away that bitter taste 
soldiers hands covered in wine. Who's to say they're out of line?
Flash of red now your dead, face that facts your maker said. 
In the ground you keep your lies. Spread the ash in disbelief toss away your 
empty grief and one of these days we all must depart. 
The troubles we've had in taming your soul, I don't know where, 
where else I would go. My life has much to bare, my life is full of woe. 
The wrath of god they fear, and it has never shown and it will never show! 
Understand words are said deals are made and don't forget, you own the 
world but not your soul that belongs to the devils you know! 
I held his golden axe, lost in fields of blood I relapsed. Turned into this 
hate machine, murder killing raping. Held this gun up to my head, pulled the 
trigger as I am dead. Smoking barrels waved goodbye.(Instrumental)It came along in one concrete form
A knowledge that turned me upside down
Let us put it this way: a new experience
Of living a life without me as I
Accept the nature and origin
Of our human condition
Believe that something defective
Flows down inside the blood of mine
Not a best thing to do, from the world\'s mindframe
To see all my pride diminishing
Given away this kind of strength once I had
To be replaced by a thing called faith
Accept the nature and origin
Of our undisputable weakness
Believe in something invincible
To take control of my whole
Accept the nature and origin
Of our undisputable weakness
Believe in something invincible
To take over my selfMist inside my house.
A wind in my dream.
I was born asleep.

Gone as if in smoke.
It's all gone and I'm awoke
and I'm reminded of something I'd forgotten.

We have met before.
Haven't we met before?
Deja Vu.

Though I might have died,
I see myself.
I turn myself around and around and my self
surrounds me everywhere.

Searched all night to find you, and now,
now that I've found you,
the hand you reach out to me
is mine.
Such is confusion over love and goodwill to men.
I believe the Sun will know me by my new name
when it comes back.

fascinated to the darkside's representation
Hiding behind the sensational lines
a reference to somewhat blasphemous

Upon mankind's dark fantasies
Evil's stabbing from behind
Ignorance calls as he always tries 
to use the words until he dies

When we looked others in need,
we must realize we're capable to care
How can we expect good respect from others
if we're still demonstrating apathy to society?

Upon mankind's dark fantasies
Evil's stabbing from behind
Those sensations soon will be
forgotten forever in the clench of fire

Paradoxical life causes suffer to mind
All harmonies only found in Christ
Reality must we face, image of God
Feel the power of good, change the fateI can't belive this now 
This isn't what I planned 
I lived and died and now 
I just can't understand 
With all the love I feel 
I could never leave her 
No matter what the cost 
My soulds the price to see her 

Oh how I love you 
The pain won't go away 
Oh when I need you 
You're always so far away 
I cry for you 
Leaving myself to blame 
I died for you 
I gave up everything 

The pain was just to much 
When I finally saw her 
She's happy and in love 
In love with my best friend 
What makes it hurt so bad 
Is that I love them both 
And they will never know 
For love I sold my soulOnly extermination in mind
Of these soldiers keeping march
Their lives don't pass for promises
Of a battle that'll arrive
With their thoughts of weapons in hands
The only goal is just to kill

War comand looking for destruction
Everything will be devastated
With many bombs falling down
Everything will be destroyed

Many wounded people on the ground
can't do anything
Seeing that vision of life vanishing

Only future can tell when it will be over
The world is suffering with the war
And everybody has been asking for peaceImmune
No more
From unruly traumas
And scary 'nevermores'
The ego sore is.

Ubi Sunt / Qui Ante Nos Fuerunt /

Foremen of cunning,
Poverty below
Both tremble before it -
A magic unfathomable.

Were one to know the asylum,
Would he flee
From hollow darkdays of humanity?
The blade of strife
Its image is cold
Yet, pruned of light 
Is the face of the old.

In hoax,
Not by hoax
Passive life is led.
The difference is not
Once the blood will be shed

Sic Transit Gloria MundiI stand outside in the cold
As I contain my ecstasy
From coming face to face with the god
After I blacked out last night into a dream

Of a beautiful dying woman
Hanging so softly against nothing
Her body illuminates and bends
Not unlike my own

I awake at the coming of man
To drown in this sorrow I've found
To burden the silhouette of the flame
Which ignites many pyres for a time of mourning

I leave now to simply caress
The skin of my own flesh
The blood it drips for the god or the absence
Of a putrid absinthe which captures my attention
On a cold night it felt like the morning
With my thoughts so rapid and vapidly decaying
The body while it's still waking
Leave me buried here even if I'm not sleepingblunt force epiphanies
beyond chaotic misunderstandings
beyond the pain of living
beyond the negative mind
beyond the darkest realms
a hit of euphoria

thoughts beyond existance
what is the purpose? how did we get here?
questions plague my mind
answers will never speak true

i would rather live my life with questions
then know all of the answers
i could never live like a sheep
even if it means i shall die unaware

existance is energy
naivity breeds contempt

deities are creation of man
your beliefs are void

wake up from your nightmare
become the lionLay down your arms and resign
the way back is filled with time
hollows out the years under the ground
what makes me feel so alone ?

something`s guiding me
through the valleys of time
something`s blinding me
I lose the balance inside

the world is too complex to define
If all things must change why do we cry ?
we are what we are just for while

oh, something`s leading me
what goes up must come down

moments get lost in the haze of tomorrow
we all walk the same way to carry the weight of the past

moments get lost in the haze of tomorrow
we don`t have the power to bury the pact with the the pastThere's a source 
There's a light 
Born of fire 
Born of water 
Circular logic 
Endless endings 
Empty meaning 
Dead eyed beings

It's all pain 
There's no gain

They build jails
For you and I 
To reside in 
To desire in 
Dictated meanings 
Dictated feelings 
Invisible chains 
Visible pain

It's all pain 
There's no gainOrganic plastic as a smooth solid food
Fascinating form a low divided voice
The fantasy of bodytalk a limit for flesh
Nitrate ass not a god's meal, creation

So it takes a rest on that bed
Quickly reach to another extent
Could be colors from TV-friends
Knuckle-duster breaks holy breath

Forget to give the sign, unspiritual
The bluster of angel's smile, silence alone

Motor deep in head running red
Greasy hand feeding sugar drops
Broken glass between her legs
Really need an exit to set

Killers payment, tomorrows dream
Demonstration, a low place's hole
Disordered picture, permanence
Questions to my answers
Pistol's pipe moving in a holster
Mirror on the seiling turns black
Corps selling tickets at the first floor
Emotions of doomedFlesh and soil 
You'll see the stars 
One yelp and sleep 
You'll nothing feel ... 

Six feet under 
You are falling down 

Mind and spirit 
Never ending pain 
And green of grove 
Your obsequies 

Come closer, I don't want to harm you. 
I'm your destiny, end of your road. 
Don't philosophise. It's simple. 
Death is unavoidable!(Instrumental)Welcome come inside
Take a seat in my church if you want to survive
Welcome come inside
And let me heal you with a touch of glory God

These are the words from what I would call a fake healer
Just with a touch he says that he can cure you from disease
I am amazed that so many buy his lies
A touch from his hands and no longer paralyzed

Fire the prophet screams and all of you fall on your back
Free now you are free the demon no longer attacks

He is a fraud working his hoax the Christians too stupid to see
People of God weakest of men inhales his false prophecy

Glory of God there's no glory to be seen
Not for you nor your fucking families
The only one that benefit from this is Him
His wealth grows thanks to your stupidity

Brainwashed children all under the prophet's spell
You give him power to continue his crusade of lies
You are too fucking stupid to feel sorry for
When reality hits you will die sick and poor

Fire the prophet screams and all of you fall on your back
Free now you are free the demon no longer attacks

He is a fraud working his hoax the Christians too stupid to see
People of God weakest of men inhales his false prophecy

Liar in the name of God
Liar in the name of God
Liar in the name of God
LIAR

Fire the prophet screams and all of you fall on your back
Free now you are free the demon no longer attacks

He is a fraud working his hoax the Christians too stupid to see
People of God weakest of men inhales his false prophecyBenign temptress
Whose throat is just outta my reach
Divine submission
Salt in the wound for the lesser of me

My heartless companion
Whose fetters tighten with every grasp
Violated muse
Whose eyes roll back now within her head

Fate springs eternal
The error that you are
Agape, your mouth remains
The root of your failures
Tired, I will walk
And tired, I will leave
When the last drop is spilled
Into your throbbing gates

Cancerous abandon
The addiction of whipped skin
Murder is the only hope
Of keeping us together

Cancerous abandon
The addiction of whipped skin
Murder is the only hope
Of keeping us together

Fate springs eternal
The error that you are
Agape, your mouth remains
The root of your failures
Tired, I will walk
And tired, I will leave
When the last drop is spilled
Into your throbbing gatesIf hearts could imply what's at stake they'd glow 
And if I could just show you the way 
And physically break all the ties that were made 
You surely would say that you already knew 
Of a place where you dreamt 

What's there to wonder? 
Does all the world now rest? 
Did all the unseen minds 
Find a new life in lunar bodies remembered 

Because all the lines in the contour will bend 
And feasibly chosen, they must have been sent 
Like heaven was closing the gates of hell 
But only was under a sworded spell 

What's there to wonder? 
Does all the world now rest? 
Did all the unseen minds 
Find a new life in lunar bodies remembered 

And maybe if we're two lives apart 
Well that makes us one 
And we'll sink our shoulders so slowly 
And please don't regret your past times 
And be still my love 
I could never be safe if the morning won't come 
Or are you afraid of the night? 
Spinning in images, graves of the light(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Gonna disappear into the deepest of mountains
Tell nobody nothin', untie all my loose ends
Flushed out to the raging seas, and I'm cuttin' free
All the dead weights that have anchored me

Goin' down past the end of the road
Where all the dead mules go
But this time I go alone

But this time I go alone
So say what you will when I'm gone
Say what you will when I'm gone
It's the same thing you say when my back is turned
You speak like a prophet of
Great things and all your knowledge

Come on fool, regurgitate a few more
Things... just told to you
Let go... I just wanna let go
Of all my hopes and dreams
And everything they mean
The games that were played
The people I betrayed
The choices and the 2-faced friends
That I've made

Let go... I just wanna let go
The ways in which I behaved
The path in which I went astray
The life I long delayed
The high prices that I payed
None of it meant shit to me
No, not anyway... let go"I know kung foo."
"...Show me."

FIGHT!Chorus: Numb, I'm sinking step by step. 
I'm extending the hand, 
trying to reach the strange future 
(while) I'm drowning into the waters OF ILLUSION!(X2). 

RUN!...There's the labyrinth of divine grace...I hide from (the) light that burns...my skin...BUT I can't scape and I never end...Never (never end!) this race...this pain...

WELCOME to all this fucking PARADOX.

The answers are fading away...
my life I'm loosing again, 
mad, sad and confused...
the life I left is now in the past...
the dreams I dream are now in the dust...
I know there is no return...

-Repeat Chorus-

... Running in this labyrinth
 I Hide from the light that burns my skin and I can't scape, 
this never ends... never... never... 
welcome to the fucking paradox!.There is no turning back now.
This is just what who you are.
These bruises will not bleed black.
Get your gun and blow her brains out.
So get your gun, put it to her head, just one shot and she will be dead. 
Get your gun the bloodshed has begun.
It will be over.
Finally we're shackling every living human being on the face of this earth.
Yet we find ourselves to be breeding into the most inhumane creatures of all.
Bury your life in.
Buried in a casket.
So shallow to see your face.
Your beauty is so precious, so precious when you're dead.(Of Elder Creation)
Of the first disobedience of the elder...
It was Tiamat who bore them
Upon the seas of Absu they surged
By their rebellion abode in the heavens
Of ages they grew in bearing and age
Beware of Anu who begat Enki
Their waters as one water
Called by name and of shape
Their doings were loathsome unto the ancient ones. 

(Return to the Lore)
For many an age Marduk ruled the throne of heaven
Ye the blood of Absu cries out to the abode of vengeance
From the blood of Kingu Marduk fashioned men as gods. 

Insurgence! They are the lost ones.
From a time before time
Of a place beyond the stars
From an age when Anu walked the earth
We have felt the wrath of the ancient ones
We are from a race beyond the wanderers of night...
Beneath the seas of the Earth, calm but thunderous
Tiamat called from her slumber, Barra Xul! 

The cold and the rain erode all things
A plague of the gods upon men of earth 

Of the rising of the elders
Upon the throne of Marduk
From the calm seas they surged forth
To slay the iniquitous sons of Tiamat
They take to the heavens 
Their eyes burning with the malice of ages
They are the children of the underworld
Men laid to waste in their path
The realm of man consumed 

The dead hath risen to destroy the living
Marduk sits in wait armed with contempt
Shadows, the burning shadows of war
Filled with an evil emotion sounds the call
Faceless and wraithlike they rode to the heavens
To disperse the limbs of Marduk upon the seas
The eye upon the throne is opened, dark waters stirred... 

(Confrontation and Decimation) 
I call forth the name of Marduk
Lest he hear my speech upon his throne
We speak to thee terms of war
Lay down your will or be slain from the skies, 

"It is i Cthulu who beckons you Marduk.. Submit or face my wrath!" 

"I bow to none, god Cthulu.. Let us make war!" 

Thus the heavens shook with the thunder of war
Such that the Earth split upon its core and was torn asunder 

(The Espousing Blackness)
As a binding of light, time became frozen as the northern seas
Unto a place where no space could exist Marduk and Cthulu were awakened from destruction. As unto their ears a voice spake.. I am the watcher of watchers, surveyor of all things...
Elder god Marduk, Ancient one Cthulu.. Your time has ended upon the black earth.. Your war hath brought destruction upon the universe. This has been the end of all things. Nothing exists of what you once fought so wantonly for.. Your immortal lives have come to end. Stoop down, unto the darkly shining abyss.. Dead and no longer dreaming..Dispel / all thoughts
Wipe it / all out
Just believe / in nothing
Because you are / just nothing
Forgive our fathers / for they'll never be in heaven
Their kingdom has come / and they'll never deliver us from evilScuffed displays, care take artifacts 
Of dandelion seed and bone 
Condensations forms on a metal skin 
A piece of something, in a mercurochrome 

Melting ice cubes at room temperature 
A finite suffering prolonged 
The desiccated sperm of Prometheus 
Some ashes for you to dine on. 

Anxiously 
Disseminated 
Into the middle 
Of nowhere

Bound.(Instrumental)high upon his mountainside 
the gloomy god looks down

he sports a woeful frown 
stygians will fear the night

crom will know no peace tonight 
as he destroys all your homes

Bobo Walker's got no feet
Smack and Spanich rice
Shoot 'em up, they're both nice
Clump! clump! clump! clump!
Junkin' dope, clump! clump!
Sellin' out on hope, clump! clump!
Bobo Walker's got no feet
He shoots up in a stump
Bobo Walker cried last night
His mom shot up a tree stumpChains are weighing down
Wrapped around me
Drag me to the edge
Constrict and bind me

Panic hopelessness, as I'm being ripped across the ground
Strength don't fail me now
Fear sets in breathing becomes scarce
Broken, I'm caving as I'm giving in to my will
Scream
Hands claw futile
Cling to the edge of Sanity

Insanity 
It destroys me
Pulls me down
Drags me down

Chains wrapping around my neck
Constricting the air that I breathe
Immobilized, I plummet to my demise
Demons destroy my body
Burdened by my great regret

Drag me
Drag me below
You won't
You won't mourn me

And thinking back I wish this to pass(Instrumental)when black deep eyes keep lowered softly,
And pick up a part of the world's misteries.
A wild wave calls love back and the source of that love
makes it to respect.

Passion means the responsibility of this forceful times
Which going by, burn themselves as we entangle with them.
When you look at the world with its garbage, from a fast carriage,
You wonder which home is. Home? Maybe those lights in the distance
That as a child I traced in the air with a finger, creating the form
of the naive fantasy.

...Life's longing moments...

It's between mind and hair that I try to taste the honey
Which is in them, and for this reason I feel ill from passion.

In these moments I'd give a caress to everything but
My hands are too small.
Is the violent cruelty of words and thoughts which sits
In nice small hands when my heart's without virtue.
I realize that this is not a real cruelty but an imprudent passion.

...Life's longing moments...
...Life's longing moments...

The poetry is sea and sad eyes in half-light which see birds
Soaring from the sea to the city...

And those eyes fly with them away from the death bed.
Moments deep of passion, small love weaves
Who is alone of fool, who has no word, who doesn't see and hear the
world, who has neither legs to walk nor wings to fly from the city to the sea.

...Life's longing moments...

The carriage ends its journey on a dead-emd platform,
There are a lot of reasons to come down or to stay there.
Even if on the coin we may find two sides, there's just one value
And in that moment you understand that on a dead-end platform
Nothing leaves and nothing arrives.

...Life's longing moments...

With my small hands, I'm gonna cherish one thing at a time.(Instrumental)I Believe

... every man believes in what he wants
Just like I do.

My church is in me
My church is in my soul
My feelings tell me
Don't pray to icons
I can't believe that God
Sees like a man
Thinks like a judge
Beats like a punisher
I believe in my way
I can't believe in that God
Sees like a man
Thinks like a judge
Beat like a punisher
He gives us freedom
He gives us the chance
Right or wrong
All is our hand

I believe in my wayGlow
Brane
Mute
Ollin

The speed of the light to a distant star
Residing inside of a hollow high-mass
The sun disappeared from the heavens
On its nightly pilgrim through the reference frame
The violence of pain and a sense of departure
Deeper down into its darkest flood

Fain
Propulsion
Plethora
Time perception

The hour-hand moved on, the timepiece drew breath
As the murmuring dwarf squatted the eternal
All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle

Following his footsteps to the sun
Lorn in the aeon of macrocosm
I see them run into the sinus of asininity
Gods blockade their eternity
Where do I run with this pain of mine
Lake of lies is turning to a sea

I see the shepherd howl, writhing, choking inside
With a black serpent hanging out of his mouth
I failed to pull the serpent out of his throat 
My horror, my hatred, my loathing, my pity
Sky illuminated by the sun, Huitzilopochtli
Tunneling dilation, photonic crystaline

Nebulous terror within the nature
Darkly feared within all the mortals
Spectres of malign perversions
Floating through moonless crypts of mine
Far away inside the luminous loopholes
Shakenings tell the winds of zenith
Yonder where the storms rush down in sea
Colossal roots of the hoary earth(Instrumental)Crept from the dirt, battered and old 
Not everything that shines has always been gold 
A faceless terror, no sign of tomorrow 
Beg on your knees in this time of sorrow 
A demon, a lord. Risen from the grave 
Black magic, witchery, your mind he'll enslave 
Confront this evil is something you will dread 
Hail to me, for I am, born dead 

Bruised ribs knuckle down, I'm gonna wreck this fucking town 
Left for dead in a previous life, come back round I'll own tonight 
Children, a wife. Banked up with greed 
Seven ply Canadian steed is all I'll ever need 
Shot out bearings, bent up trucks 
A head full of haze and a mind full of fuck 
Sorcery of a different kind 
Brainwashed youths, ruined minds 
Do my bidding, be my rats 
Hail to the lord of mesh caps 

Flannel shirt, cut off denim 
Eyes of red from smoking resin 
Hesh law is how we roll 
Not down with that? Smoke my pole 
Drop in, act a dick 
Gonna smash a fast trick 
Blunt to fakie, hardflip disaster 
Bow to the one, the concrete master 

Born dead(Instrumental)Ruling the earth's sad melody
Ruling the war's violent melody

The King of the Nature is Shatan
That doesn't affirm
Or else to deny

His chimerical clouds
Build the sky's fire
That extinguishes the star of the glory light

Oh earth, hear those blasphemies
Because those are blasphemies of your sons
The divine concience fire

Oh, Have-Iod
Oh, Have-Iod

Oh life,
You are only illusion
Go back to your original ashes

I'm the life,
The dream's life
Or the life's dream's
To me the desolated and full of painI don't know what to write about
I don't know what this song is all about
I could talk about the million times
I was trashed by all my best friends in life...

I could talk about the good old times
When my parents used to get me all those toys
When my brother used to show me
All of the rock 'n' roll bands play on TV

They asked me to write...
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I don't feel like thinking
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I decided to write
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go

I hope this song will take me to Japan
I'll take a flight, not the same old broken van
I could talk about the million times
I was stuck in the middle of the highway
I could talk about the things I love
My horror movies or the books I'm so fond of
I could talk about my girlfriend,
Now she's in the next room singing like no tomorrow

They asked me to write...
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I don't feel like thinking
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I decided to write
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go

There are many ways to end a song
Even if you don't know where you started from
I could talk about the million times I was stuck in the middle of a song-line...Our ship struck twice by a whale
Now dig in a bail before it's too late
With the brine up to our knees
All I can think is how you'll be the first to be eaten
You will
With the shit this deep you have to leave all the things behind that you can't eat
Far too many adrift at sea
You are our chosen source of meat
With the brine up to our knees
All I can think is how you'll be the first to be eaten
You willhere we are 
searching for the desert queen 
no one knows where she resides 
hiding beneath the suns bright sheen 
black figures surround 
questioning the presence of the unknown man 
hail to the sun above 
form of the all seeing glowing eye 

deafening and blind 

questioning 
what we see in the distance 
salvation comes before us 
but it is but a filthy lie 
the promise of water 
in this wretched land 
all is taken before us 
sand madness surrounds 

falling 
in a dark horrid cave 
desert queen before us 
shining in her madness 
i will slit your throats sons 
you will not get to live 
stumble into my cave 
and youll be sent to hellGlimmer

Nothing is with thee

Terrifying decline
Reaping fear... killing spree
Brutal powers unleashed

We are crossing the line
At fever pitch of denial

Now we descend into hate
Eternal darkness awaits
All life's lost... creeping death
The world's remaining dead

Burnt by the time and the scorn of revenge
Longing for the total eclipse
Cruel is the failure of man
A feast for the apocalypse
Burnt by the lies and the pain of revenge
Longing for the total eclipse
Dark is the failure of man
A feast for the apocalypse

Kill... to destroy hidden chains
Be a part of the sickening games
Haunting burst... crushing force
Peace without remorse

We are crossing the line
At fever pitch of denial

Burnt by the time and the scorn of revenge
Longing for the total eclipse
Cruel is the failure of man

Burnt by the lies and the pain of revenge
Longing for the total eclipse
Dark is the failure of man
A feast for the apocalypse

The children of scorn
The human plague is torn

Burnt the seed of ages
Crush the seed to dust
While the days of wrath
We have sworn to death

Architects of violence... architects of hell
Architects of murder... in the abyss we dwell
Architects of riots... Architects of might
Architects of fury... we are led by spite

All our nightmares are becoming real
Crossing the line at fever pitch of denialAnother day and our gods don't take aim at us
We check it off as a victory of faith
Living our life in a utopian dream-land
While those above are deciding our fate
A profit gained and territory expanded
A loss of life is no cause for shame
Protect and serve, protecting their wallets
For even deities will bow to the bank

Obey our orders and we'll show you the enemy
We'll take them down so you can be what you want to be
Ignore the truth for our monetary gain
For the American dream

Aggression born of fear
A truth we'll never know 
Ignorance is bliss for us
We'll run them down to take control
A war to create peace
For our own kind at least
For our superior souls

Terror campaign against the objects of terror
We'll save your souls by bombing your land
Take what we want and crush all opposition
A thousand soldiers roaming the sands
Their eyes will never see what remains of the truth
They question nothing when they're living like kings
Creating fear to invade who we want to
No one is stronger than the land of the free

Obey our orders and we'll show you the enemy
We'll take them down so you can be what you want to be
Ignore the truth for our monetary gain
For the American dream

Aggression born of fear
A truth we'll never know
Ignorance is bliss for us
We'll run them down to take control
A war to create peace
For our own kind at least
For our superior soulsCat scans inside, conducted, without soul, or are you 
Deep inside, piece of you, fragmentation, variant 
Sunbaked you, fossil soul, counts misfortune, one minute old 
After you've, hacked your way in, you can show, yourself. 
The fucking way out.

He'll be laughing, how mechanic

Don't you worry, I could kill him

 

Are you crying?  Go to her,

You'll feel better, open lungs...

I will drown her, to make me happy

She'll see clearer, underwater

 

 It's all the same, we are evil

 

Voices, louder...getting closer

All the while, hatred burning

Tell yourself, you are special

Don't believe it, start to injure...

 

I will drown her, to stop the voices

She'll see clearer, underwater

At the ocean, when I grab you

Listen closely, as I whisper:

 

"Tell your children

I won't hurt them"

 

Death makes her realize

That I've always cared

As she's pinned underwater

Gasping for air

 

We Are Evil

It's the same...And the Dusk came, over the forgotten land
and the Dusk came, while the old Pharaon
was imploring the Great God RA.
"RA God of the sun, Enemy of Darkness
incoming, destructive take care of Your
devote sons. Arise, as the dismembered Osiris arised.
Do not allow the incoming of the Black God Seth"
The black priest appeared in the Temple
"Your time has come" he said " no more of your false Gods
it's time to restore the Ancient, millenary order.
Sons of Set are waiting, ravenouses the incoming moment;
Our Queen, the Dissolute Nefert, will be our Pharaoh!"
"I am the cruel Pharaoh
Nefert by name, death and sin by nature
I lay with Anubi and Thoth is my lover
In my hand I hold the chain of misery
Come with me I'll show you the pleasure of perdition "
I came, I did for you to trample, upon the ground of Amenti,
I placed the demons under your feet, Only for your domain
I came did for you that everyone could see
Your Majesty Mistress of death. For you to command
over their faces the Primordial Fear
From my bed of bones I've heard my sons
calling me here! I came, No more the Sun will be honoured!
The Moon is the Mistress, and to Her I bow.
And the dusk came, over the forgotten land of the Ancient Egypt,
Wonderful Queen incarnated
The ever-lasting damnation is come
Heaven is lost, Hell is real. The Dissolute and Tenebrouse Queen
observe and laughs,
Obscurity, the flowing blood, destruction.
She wait for the moment when She'll lay with God
As th eprimordial Father and Mather eons ago.
A damned dynasty, the prophecy is unveiled
The end of Osiris the revenge of Set, Death come back to life,
Oh mortals, bow and pray 'cause the Evil God is reborn!!- The Markings of Destiny - 4:90

The cry of war.
Hearken elders.. The time has come
Our destiny.. Is at hand
May dead rise.. Smell the incense
Stoop not down.. Yet rise above
Unto the abyss.. Unbidden hatred
Faithless depths.. Names of lore
Ashen graves.. Ancient in forms
Mist of life.. Beckon my wishes
I, the last of the elder force beckon once more
Waken so that we may reap our crimson vengance
Cthuhlu lies in wait upon thrones of blood and lies
Dead and dreaming no more fathers i do conjure

- Masses of Destruction - 7:98

As the earth shook.. Upheaving the lands
Infernal fire risen.. From eternal graves
Skies did open.. Winged fates flew fourth
Uncreation of death.. Storms of fire
Open the gate.. Pass the realm
Ia ia dag! Ia kanpa gat!
Crown of realms.. Ashen graves
Mist of life.. Beckoned my wishes
All was silent..

- Upon the Throne of Iniquity - 5:73

Hearken! for our generation did come fourth upon this realm once more from our 
eternal resting places to reclaim the land we hold so true from those ancient 
fathers of iniquity, death, and lies.. Absu did stir with an evil rage upon hearing 
of the invocation of the elder ones once more and he did summon Tiamat whom
inturn brought fourth Cthulhu whom upon hearing of this resurrection did strike 
out with rage upon the body of Kingu and did render him headless as a corpse..
The dark waters did cease and sudside as the mighty Marduk rose once more 
crying out in vengance upon the Ancient one Tiamat whom had slain his son in 
the last great battle when dark waters did rise. Tiamat, sensing a presence and 
lept in fear between the spaces where worlds collide for fear that Marduk would soon 
be near. Cthulhu stirred upon his throne and did summon the guardian of the gate Iak 
Sakkak. And his demon horde stood forth before the gate of realms in wait of the Elder
ones. Through fires of unlife the elder ones gathered with sword and shield
Their war was one of time and peril for the right of the black earth
Men would recall this battle in written texts for centuries of darkness
Tiamat waits in wings of fear upon sensing the elder presence was near
Storm the gates to War..

- The Signifigance of War - 0:09

Over deserts, through eternal oceans they journey
Above the sky, past fragments of time they leap
Walking upon the ravaged lands between the lands
Wanderers of the night are thee of Elder creation
Upon the gates they arrived and all was silent
Storms of.. Fire.. I call you fourth
Hear me.. Ancients.. I beckon you
Your time.. is near.. Hearken fathers
Open.. the gates.. you shall befall
Tiamat sensing battle lept from spaces between worlds
Upon the back of Marduk she did leap with heart of fire
Marduk did cry out in name unknown to her burning
With enraged emotion he did lash with swords of frost.
Marduk lashed out with swords
Upon the heart of the ancient one
To spill the venom of her blood
With sorcery he did carve a wound
Tiamat did cry out with pain and blood
and lashed with spears of black earth
With the soul of death she cried out
Dead and not dreaming Marduk will lye

- Songs of Fate - 1:97

Marduk did fall as death upon a black heaving earth
As Tiamat did cry of victory and all were pale of fear
Whence from the blackened earth the magician rose
With rays of infernal frost magick he pierced her heart
Blood of her blood spilt upon her grave
Lord of Magick spits of a venom gaze
Call whom ye call Tiamat hath been slain
Deadly dreaming upon field of crimson rain
Past the gates the elder gods came fourth unto sands of frozen time
With wings of fire they did rise upon the walls of the ancient castles
In search of the ones whom so called upon a plague of black impeity
Choosen ones who may rid the earth realm of those gods of death
Upon his throne Cthulhu was filled with an evil emotion.. Hearken Absu!
Let us make monsters that they may go fourth and destroy these sons of iniquity!
Upon this enchantment Hubur did rise and make beasts of venomous blood
Monsters of serpents skin and fire of dragons breath, with horns of Shammash
To the gates the beasts did flee to conquer those gods of iniquity.. 
Deadly dreaming.. Fates are singing.. Songs of searing..
Of burning eye i saw an army of the dead rising from walls of flame..
Dead and dreaming.. Fates are singing.. Songs of chaos..

- Dead and Dreaming - 7:73

War did consume all of life force
Fields of ravaged crimson chaos
Swords and spears clash
Fire and frost burning
Crimson rain falling
Wars of centuries
War did consume all life force
Fields of ravaged crimson chaos
Watchers.. of all.. Hearken.. i call..
Names of.. 50 names.. i call.. to me..
Fathers.. we rise.. before you.. our cries
Infernal.. magick.. frost fire.. burning
Watchers.. of thee.. Hear me.. i call
Names of.. Marduk.. beckoned.. to me..
Ancient.. fathers.. hear us.. rising..
Infernal.. magick.. dragon fire.. searing 
Of death, gods fell until 3 remained..
I, stand before you Cthulhu with son Enki, Marduk
Hear me so that we may reap a crimson vengance
You have ruled this land upon a throne of blood and lies
Dead and dreaming you shall lye upon that throne once more
The earth shook.. Dark waters stirred
Infernal fire risen.. Marduk lunged fourth
Skies did open.. Cthulhu lashed out 
Uncreation of Death.. Both pale of fear
Opened the gate.. Dark waters surged
Ia ia dag! Marduk fell upon graves!
Crown of realms.. Cthulhu cried war
Mists of death.. Called by 7 names..
Cthulhu did gaze upon me with eyes of death and i could feel my body turn 
pale with fear. My body did levitate above the ground as infernal fire filled 
my eyes i cried names of war.. As i peered upon the corpse of Marduk i did 
lash with serpents upon the body of Cthulhu. Whom did turn his face and 
returned with burning rays of binding darkness upon my body 
and a sword in his possession. All was calm as dark waters stirred.(Instrumental)Battle honour and victory shall be ours
To commemorate our dead
To banis their "evil" from this world
And recreate the pagan paradise that was
tramppled under-foot
The witches shall again become the wise,
in this our new land of the young
We, who contorl the storms. Our victory is
their demise
The "harmony" has broken and as
christendom falls
They will see the horror of that which they did
do unto us
We shall prevailI embrace great victory!
Ride, spread the word
Spread to my people the great news
We shall return
To our splendid capital
We shall return
And bask in the glorious greetings

Bask you shall
Bask you shall
Fools 
Senseless fools

Hark! Across the horizon - I see it
Our homes - great capital
Come forth and ride
March on and return
Our great victories
Will make us heroes 
Our great battles shall make us nobles

What am I?
That follows
That which is
Unseen

We return
To our homes
Oh great city
We return

Come feast my armies
Come feast my sons

I follow
Come my lambs
I call to you
You shall follow

You feast your armies
- I'll take your sons

Lead me to your precious babies
I come for them
And yet you know nothing
Of all that I am
And return with that
Which shall take
All that it desires
All that it desires

Oh! Father
Can you see it... not?
It calls me
Beckons me to follow
I feel a will overpowering me
Save me - I must go
The elders see it not

Oh! Children follow
My will captures your souls
I take you and you shall follow
Watch as they follow
See not that which leads
Those fools they know not of my
But you my children,
Shall learn all

To the mountain
To the mountain
Come infant disciples
I shall grow eternally strong
You hear my song
It enchants your souls
You are in my power
I shall take you away!Raised from the tomb of the sun
Where the pure is primitive
As primitive as Saturnus and Cronos
She is the stars' veil

Created in the Horus-Aeon
Inside the rain of opium
And distilled from the celestial nectar
She's young and woman

In your forms
The nymph's seduction
Death and life,
I want you,
Babylon's whore

Princess of ecstasy
Child of vulgarity
Goddess of innocence
Daughter of desire
Mother of illusion

She lives in an incestuous romance
Beautiful symphony of the cursed
Your sanctuary are the woods
Flying in the universe of delirium

Muse of profane poets
Your dogma and law are the sin
In your lips: the black magiks
In your spirit: the spell of Caim

Eyes of tantric nature
As inspiring as the hills of Kanchenjunga,
Explicit female desire
Dawn of the unmistakable blood(Instrumental)I''m in hell, can you feel my pain?
Can you feel my sorrow?
Can you see my will falling apart?

I can see clearly, my end
It crawls on me
My feelings turn in circles
Help! Help me!

They see my end
It crawls on me
My feelings turn in circles
Help! Help me!

The wreck of mind!

Pain, I shall bear, no more
Sadness, will be turned to light
Freedom of soul, I aspire
Happiness I''ll find through...

A spark of lifeHail 
On your knees 
Worthless men, bow to me 
I'm your king, I'm your god 
I'm your savior, am I not? 
I've brought you peace, calmed your fears 
Yet 'tyranny' is all you sneer 
"Free our speech, free our mind" 
You're free to speak, and free to die 

Watching over you, controlling all you do 
To blind the eyes of man is to blind the truth 
Now that you have seen the power that I breed 
Now that you have seen through the eyes of the king 

Down 
The hammer falls 
Now your fears will be resolved 
Cut the tongue, flay the back 
Silence greets the whip's crack 
Your swine blood coats the dirt 
The eighth plague set to work 
I'll purge you from this land 
Waves of death from my hand 

Choke it down, bleed it out 
You are now alone 
Thoughtless pawns pushing on 
The end follows close 
Much braver men have faced their end 
With terror in their eyes 
But you can't feel fear as the end nears 
You don't own your minds 

SOLO: Szemanski 

Hail 
On your knees 
If you remain, bow to me 
I've stripped you down, forced you out 
And by now there is no doubt that 
I am life, yet also death 
I'm your fears, your prayers beset 
I am evil, I'm a saint 
And I'll live on far past my days 

I'm your kingNo regard for human life your pride must have grown 
Betrayed as your empire gets overthrown 
Bullshit falls from your mouth whenever you're in town 
Nothing but a kiss ass, your ships going down 
Organize your battle plan, now it's in full swing 
Nothing but a know it all, baptized in sin 
Thrown about your knowledge, at a bloody cost 
You've fucked yourself this time, social holocaust 

Pressure 

Crept in like a virus, the power was too strong 
Now they see what you are, a cheating, lying, mong. 
Sort things out before I kick back 
One on one, wait for my attack. 
Should've cut the cord before it all began 
I win you lose, my 5 year plan 
Have you ever wondered what went wrong? 
When your life's and anti-climax it's gone on too long 

Pressure 

Keep your fucking mouth shut, the shit stops here 
With blood upon your sneakers it's all become clear 
Has your brain given up, why do you need approval? 
This town would be a better place after your removal 
Scum of the earth, the shit on my shoe 
When you're gone that's when I'm through 
I'll be the one to cast the first stone 
Watch as your life, gets brought downHello, sonny!

FUCK YOUCarry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

No!

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
The center lights around your vanity
But surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry (don't you cry no more)Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just covering up

Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a little girl in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go

I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A.

It can't be better, everything is nice
Violent deceases, mass-killer attack
Inquisition's art and nuclear defects
And grinding your cock today
Desparated black hole is my way
I raise my fist for punishment... necromancer
And falling between like a real jackpancer
You never believe in pleasure and pain
The only you shelter hold the fire again

disaster is my name and torture is my game
I visit only your bedroom and with me my friends destruction and doom
In this final dream I am the pain, you are my greed
I torture all I can get, it's my job, I'm a guy who is not bad

Meaning disappear, I lost my mind on the other side
The hardcore in death can never die
Painted on a picture with the blood from my veins
Exquisite and delicious hold the fire again

The downfall of mankind, mirrored fun in my eyes
It can't be better, everything is nice

Disaster is my name and torture my game
I stealth around in this boring world
I am the noise you hear if you feel I am near
In this final dream I am the pain, you are my greed
I torture all I can get, broken bones, you are turning mad(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Find comfort in violence, Breed shame through sex,

Yet we won't proclaim that we feed off misery
Self-destructive thoughts fueled by zealotry

Our Chaos is their control

Lust is a form of obsession
Greed is carefully patrolled
Kept separated by our reactions
Kept oblivious to their control
We watch this, they watch us, we give in, they watch us bleed x4
Chaos is deliberately fabricated, our confusion gives them control...

They want us numb
The want us dumb

Suckin' blood, with no regrets!

The yawning lad in PJs
Dreams of asphalt and spires
Once did try to run away
But now it's time to retire.Rising in fear, growing with memories of past
Hundred years, corrupting the justice of God
Methods of pain, a circus of a mankind in birth
paranoia in frames, the attitude of the eastern way of life...

Tyrant, the freedom is falling
Tyrant, monarchy as hell

Hear the law - the time of constract and creation
Feed with awe - Orders, submission, destruction

Tyrant, the freedom is falling
Tyrant, monarchy as hell

No more spawns - the era is clear and complete
Only pawns - myths, fear, disease

I stand across the world domain
I am the God of human slave
Command and reconstruct
Craving and paralyzied

My orders are only inviolate and unbroken
hear my words and act like a slave machine
I am the rule of every unspoken truth
A universal king, creator of your filthA different view is the reason for a massacre!
An eerie creature ends up being the darkest of demons.
The massacre of one soul is the grand slaughter of life itself.
The dormant beast inside all of us waits the awake of fear!

Don't bury what's unknown!

A blessing upon me to be seized a curse on you, envy!

The jealousy in your secrets drains all of your life and soul!
Always diminishing what you can not understand nor see.
The ways of existence aren't explained in a god nor man!

To demonize the unknown is to fear yourself!

Dry are the oceans of the acceptance, all brings discordance into this dead man.
Tolerance is gone from all this, demonize all that is now known.

No voices will come to save our mankind;
savior I am not, nor your unseen gods.

Questions and riddles lie in our inner self nature and all that we must try to find and unwind through out our life.
To fear the unknown is to close imagination and all hope to survive the ghost of numbness and lies.

Open yourself to chances of life or close your desires and you'll die inside.
Cloak all your feelings to stop from healing, imagination is resurrection!It's too late to cry out all the pain
From now on it is there to stay
Can't erase those sinister visions
I'm striving under this weight

So I turn away and hide my face from the daylight
An attempt to escape this void of false security
Hope I'll have strength to move on
And wait for the pain of life to drag me back to surface again

Black clouds of self-destruction are towering
Now higher than ever before
Casting the gray shade of oblivion
Upon the ruins of my lifeAt a certain point in your life, you start to realize you know more dead people than living.
At about this same point, you also start to realize you will do anything for true love..

His name is Francesco, engineer of the dead

The Buffalora Cemetary is plagued by unsettling circumstances in which the dead rise from their graves
Francesco is not alone in his quest to keep the dead, dead. He is joined by his mute assistant Gnaghi

Keep them Dead!

It was the Cemetary.. Her husband dead, her weeping at his grave
He found love there.. He found her alone
It was over his grave they found each other
Marble Orchard makeout.. Sex on her husbands grave
He is not dead. Upon escaping his tomb he finds her neck

She has been destroyed.. The only woman he ever loved
To the grave with her.. To await her impending return

Endlessly he waits until finally she rises from her tomb

Its not her.. She must be silenced as Gnaghi understands.

Set upon the living in states of lucid dreaming he lashes
Taking the lives of those who languish

Beseeched by upswings in buisness he toils restlessly
All the while returning the dead to the ground

She returns to Francesco as someone else
Leaving him with heartache and impotence

Gnaghi finds love with the mayors daughter
As she flees with her love on a motorbike
They meet a fiery end with a bus of boyscouts

Massacre!
Insomnia!
Hopeless!
Massacre!

As Gnaghi finds love with the severed head of the mayor's daughter
Francesco claims to have found love once more with a college student
No love.. She was a whore so she paid with her life in a fiery hell
Gnaghi looses his love to a gunshot when she kills her poor daddy

Back to the cemetary.. Lines of the living blur with the dead
No love to be found.. They must leave Buffalora
What exists of the world beyond this place?
Marble Orchard massacre! The deaths were mine!!
There is nothing.. Nothing left of the dying place for them.

Drive as far and as fast as you can
Until you reach the edge of the world

At a certain point in your life, you start to realize you know more dead people than living.
At about this same point, you also start to realize you will do anything to escape reality..

There is nothing..(Instrumental)The sound of your cries
The same sordid feeling

Feel my caress

As death sets in

 

Your pained expression

A work of beauty

Exquisite guise

Excels the lust

Distress turns to pleasure

Feelings of love

Confused by the torture

Deviant freak

 

No light in sight

But there's one thing to remember

 

Pain is serene

 

Then comes regret

Evolves into fear

 

Pain is Serene

 

Torture cleanses, distinct hatred, at your service

 

Our final gaze

Ended too soon

Pain is serene

As it takes you away...I have thrown my future
for built total emptiness
in my soul and heart

all the words I say
have no form and accent
they become a wall
with a out sound

CHORUS:
I'm crawling in the pain
that shows me the ghosts
of this abominate game
and I will REST IN PAIN

I that can't see other
than offs of glass
that says in front of me
and make fun of me

(CHORUS)

POST:
When I will listen again
the wind on through the leafage
whisper the silence of night
perhaps never
and I will REST IN PAIN

Why they don't built some big trash
for throwing all days I used yet
looking for shadow of myself in death

I have thrown my future
for built total emptiness
in my soul and heart
in all word I say

All the words I say
have no form and accent
they become a wall
that fix you in your eyes

I have thrown my future
for built total emptiness
in my soul and heart
in all word I say

reeds gesnoeidAfter a blackness filled with silence, 
 and three days in a row of twenty nights 

 I felt ugliness 
 unite to my neurons 

 Altered, rectified 
 I persisted the insights in strips of small sides 

 You exist no more 
 Neither God exist 

 The sordid and insane thoughts, 
 awakened each spring about a plurality of ideas 
 ....you and God can do a little to stop them 

 After a blackness filled with silence, 
 it was night after night 

 You exist no more 
 Neither God existDeep down underneath the ground
In chambers clotted with the rotting dead
Steaming vats filled with vampire bats,
Tanis root, and decaying heads
The potion made, we disseminate
Spiking thousands of liters of grog
Numbskull to inebriate
Sends you into a heavy metal fog

(gang) I am a numbskull!
I bang heads
Moshing in the graveyard and defiling the dead
(gang) I am a numbskull!
I twist brains
Thrashing 'til we drive you insane

On a cold night in the local pub
An alliance was put to the forge
F.K.U was there with Lord Gore and Frightmare
Machetazo, Haemmorhage, and Engorged
We all toasted with some numbskull,
"Here's to waging a metal war!"
The chalices emptied, we took to the stage
To carry out our declaration of gore

(gang) I am a numbskull!
I drink deep
Rot gut consumed by a quartet of creeps
(gang) I am a numbskull!
I infect
Drink up, it's time to snap necks

The crowd was amassed at the edge of the pit
Timidly cringing so as not to get hit
The numbskull started kicking in as the bodies were flying through the air
A rictus grin on each face in the crowd, coupled with a psychotic stare

Their skin decayed and fell off in lumps
And hair came out in greasy clumps
Their blood coagulated in their veins
As deafening thrash riffs tore apart their brains

Zombified in the pit, gore addicted misfits
The first band was backstage, they came out and got slayed
Devoured by the undead, gutted and splattered
Unique Leader catalogs were torn up, burned, and scattered

(gang chant) Numbskull!

The show ended in a bloodbath
But nothing dead shall truly dead remain
The doors were opened to release the numbskulls
So they'll infect every poser's brain

I am a numbskull!
I'm unhinged
Murdering and moshing as on rot gut we binge
I am a numbskull!
I am you
'Cuz you're a fucking numbskull tooNow the general rides, to face the fear
And the pain of knowing, it's around the town!
So never move away, the truth is on the run
The pursuit is gaining, we shout out warnings!

Witch! Burn!
Your spells can't save you now!
Burn! Fire!
Till the fires of hell... reach out to Salem!

So never look away, the nose is all but hung
It's just another day, the past is all but done
You stand accused, we all judge as one
And as the words are spoken
Thou shall not suffer a witch to live!

Witch! Burn!
Your spells can't save you now!
Burn! Fire!
Till the fires of hell... reach out to Salem!

So the verdict is out and the judgement is heard
All the souls are knowing throughout the town
So never look away, the truth is on the run
The pursuit is gaining, we shout out warnings!

Witch! Burn!
Your spells can't save you now!
Burn! Fire!
Till the fires of hell... reach out to Salem!Opposing mankind, death by the hand
Lunacy and anger is the only command
Thrashing dormant cities, right to its' source
Attacking the world with fury as cause

Deviant companions with mutual thoughts
Thoughts with a certain pattern
Acts of madness, ruthlessness as rule
No man nor beast will be as cruel

With hatred as strength
We claim the throne
Now is the time
For the operation massacre

Conquerers of the undead
Did heed these words
The final hour arrived
For the operation massacre 

With hatred as strength
We claim the throne
Now is the time
For the operation(Instrumental)The expedition's lost 
Communications down 
The ship is out of fuel 
All hope is gonna drown 

The storm is rolling in 
The crashing of the waves 
Our time is running out 
This ship will be our grave 

No, no you won't take me down 

The smell of death surrounds me 
I can taste it in the air 
A shadow in the water 
It's more than I can bear 

No, no you won't take me down 
No, no you won't take me downEat your poop!
Drink your pee!
Shit on yourself
and please shit on me!
Worship urine!
Worship crap!
Take a poo poo
and wipe it on your sack

Diarrhea on the wall
Diarrhea on the floor
Diarrhea on the ceiling
Diarrhea...galore!
Take a bath in perfection
Take a bath in my defecation!

poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo!

Come to our mass
and forever worship...POOOOP!

99 cups of piss on the wall
99 cups of piss
Take a cup, drink it up
98 cups of piss on the wall
Look at all the kukka all over your hands
Put in some bread and make a sand...wich!

The Chapel Of Poo is the chapel for you!185 miles to Sacramento 
186 to San Francisco 
210 to Hollywood 
Hundres of miles to anything good 

We are trapped, we cannot mature 
Cannot leave, that's for sure 
Only death can lift us out 
Of this town and its stagnant gout 

I've got to get out of this hospice 
And there's only one real way 
I would sniff glue but they've taken it away 

Can't run and my wheelchair's too slow 
Long for a hit from a poisoned arrow 
Call a local a "fag" is the only way to die 
Wheel me out on the street so I can tryAdmonish the population until they're reluctant of fact. Blind them with theology. Nothing's more compelling than the power of contingency. When it gives the population, perception of immortality. This blasphemous conception of divinity. Set forth to control the means of our individuality. Manipulation! Sick, malicious, self-loathing, evil. Incompetent, dreadful, resistance seems futile. The purpose of our existence lies within the structure of our habitat, survival our
primary objective. To perpetuate life remains our main ambition. An image in which we still have yet to attain. The life of man can be an admirable circumstance, but our immoral actions for greed, money, and power will forever be a blemish upon the face of the earth. Sick, malicious, self-loathing, evil. Incompetent, dreadful, resistance seems futile. To perpetuate life remains our main ambition. To perpetuate life remains our main ambition. MANIPULATION! Start using your head, and think for yourself. Start using your head, and think for yourself. Start using your head, and think for yourself. This blasphemous conception of divinity. Set forth to control the means of our individuality. Blind them with theology. Nothing's more compelling than the power of contingency when it gives the population perception of immortality. CHRIST! Fucking lies.(Instrumental)We're radiated we're generated 
Variegated and duplicated 
Reformulated Body and soul 
Laminated plastic matter 

Is it getting better or worse? 
Is this a blessing or another curse? 

Caught in a rapid race of self gain & profit 
A chase few do summit, all the rest will plummet 

Shame on egotistic sales-men 
On man who failed to see 
To notice, it's simple, it's final, over 
In to a synthetic hell, piles of litter, piss and 
Artificial fiber nature will not filter 

Abandon abort this anatomic sell 
Free the self from the fabric 
And all material 
A burial of the economic spell 
See now clear, the primal logic 
All is immaterial 

Disintegrated, deteriorated 
Evaporated, eradicated 
Decontaminated and rid of all 
Fabricated, manmade plaster 

Is it getting better or worse? 
Is this a blessing or another curse? 

Shedding all layers, stripping us bare is time's 
Evident effect of wear & tear 

Out of the organic shell 
Mind over matter 
This body is superficial only but a cover 
Doubt the automatic or dwell here forever 
Back to the initial, finger pulls a trigger 

A barrier withholding a vast mass of 
axial rooted path ways in its border 
No textures yet cover the castes 
A spiral emitted math lays in disorder 

Lack of order! Random order! 
Random order! Lack of order! 

I'm made Sick of this disarrayI see the world just like it is
Black - red - grey hell
Black - vengeance
Red - blood
Grey - nonsense
I paint in these colours by myself
I paint my vision on the canvas of life
I deal the colours out to the grey cards of imagination
Pain... pure pain
Assumes a shape of extasy
Bodily torment tramples psychic torment
Wins ....it's easier
To put up with it 
I suffer mildly
Splendid view
Blood.... more and more blood
Lust for love - war of anxiety
Lust for understanding - war of words
Lust for nearness - war of honour
I open my eyes...pain
Pure pain .... it lulles , alleviates
Mad lust, war of souls
I'm fighting with myself ... I'm waiting
I'm fighting with myself ... I'm waitingDim the darkness, light the madness 
I'm trying to adapt 
Hearing faces, seeing voices 
I think I finally snapped 
Deal the cards and pour the wine, the party starts at eight 
You're invited to the freak show, it's better if you're late 

and all your voices tick tick ticking 
picking at my brain 
I'll keep it together, storm the weather 
you're the one insane 

I've never been so well connected, I'm even scaring me 
The world is mine, I have control 
it's what I'm meant to be 
it's a three ring circus here, not even on the chart 
we set sail for insanity, it ends before we start 

and all your voices tick tick ticking, picking at my brain I'll keep it together, storm the weather, you're the one insane 

what you call normal, I just see as abnormality 
Call me crazy, I refuse to Face realityDeath from an ancient godless curse
Fire and brimstone from the sky
The boatman waits for his passengers
It's my Burden of Ubiquitous Scars 
Soldiers swallowed by and angry sea
A glimpse of a smile on the boatman's face

Spoken Words:
Behind the veil of the overwhelming facade
The waters will not be contained
Cascading incisions, 
Carving the soil of familiarity, 
Digging a grave for weathered perception
The lesser waters traveled flow deliberately, 
Offering perpetual exodus, 
Never looking back to the walking skeletal remains
Skeletal remains (x3)

The Burden of Ubiquitous Scars 
Behind the veil of this facade
You put me here I took you there
What was then is not right now

It's my burdenBehind the tragedy of this world,
I feel my life slipping away, trough my fingers;
Seeds of blind salvation bloom,
By fields that spit thermonuclear remains;
My faith was an honest dream,
Pure like the wings of a crying angel;
But the sand of time runs quick,
And now I await my righteous misery...

Now you're sure, you will to follow the sheepard of lies?
If you dig underground, you think, to save yourself?
Are you sure you will take a place in this society?
I hope you try to live the best you can, 
'cause you're welcome
In a world called truth...

Welcome to the world called truth...As the ground finally ceases its violent tantrums
We watch white caps grow like starving phantoms

First the sea retreats like shrinking, diseased gums
Baring its briny teeth before blocking out the sun

We will be washed clean and torn asunder
Crushed within our homes to drown in stone and lumber

We will be washed clean and torn asunder
Our culture swept away as we slumber

We will be washed clean and torn asunder
Moored no longer to centuries of comfort

Like an invading state, water storms down our streets
An infantry of waves, repeatedly sacking our cities

First the sea retreats like shrinking, diseased gums
Baring its briny teeth before blocking out the sun

Each charging wave, higher than our palace walls
Before my gaze, family and friends simply dissolve

The sea is retreating, the sea is rethinking
Its purpose for creating anything terrestrial

The sea is swelling, the sea is groaning
Its intentions are to reclaim us allPeople Of Dead Living
Live in the underground
Whispers of wind in the night
It is their cries

What if burying bodies
Is not the right option?
What if graves 
Sometimes open?
What if the life can exist
Together with death?
What will these beings do
Outside the coffin?
 
Some souls are leaving
Some may not
They stay alone in the dark
Forever more
Years of darkness
Torture these souls
And evil slowly
Takes them by it's claws

The sun is slowly
Fading away
Whispers are stronger
Day by day
Angels are crying
For their pain
They cannot help them
Already insane

Lost souls
Unleash them all
Dead bodies
Wake up to life
Invading zombies
Leaving their graves
Returning home
With lust and hunger
For flesh and blood...
People of  dead living
Finally alive
And it is the end
Of this worldI am, a creation of dust and made by dust
I am, a free entity with all the choices in front of me
In me, there is a will to live my life
In me, there is a destructive tendency built by hate

Questions asked, never satisfied with my existence
"To where I have to go? The purpose of my direction"
"Why must I face all these sufferings?"
I've been longing to find my reason to exist

A life of sin is reality I must accept
The Book cleary refers to fall of our ancestor
Many would call it as a tale and nothing more
But I can feel its Truth in my own bad blood

Until I find the reason of my suffering...
...through the knowledge written in Bible
No one could make me satisfied with the answer
No one knows me, except The One whoe gives me breath

In fact there is only way God has prepared
I don't think it's wise to take all things just for granted
In fact that there are many distractions around
Try to keep myself from knowing His willRadio, live transmission.
Radio, live transmission.

Listen to the silence, let it ring on.
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun.
We would have a fine time living in the night,
Left to blind destruction,
Waiting for our sight.

And we would go on as though nothing was wrong.
And hide from these days we remained all alone.
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time.
Touching from a distance,
Further all the time.

Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio...

Well I could call out when the going gets tough.
The things that we've learnt are no longer enough.
No language, just sound, that's all we need know,
To synchronise love to the beat of the show.

And we could dance.

Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio...Pretenders will fail
Substitute of perfection
Is sentenced to death

Wires twined round necks
Skin comes off from a heart
Target is set
Time to eradicate
Smell of mankind

Go!
Steel against flesh
Merciless extermination

Human mistake must be erased

Stainless beasts are fruits
Of sick imagination
Groan of street is proclamation of war
Programmed to kill
They follow instructions
Reproduction of humans
Will be interrupted

Hatred charge turned them to life
Poisonous oil streams from mechanical wounds
Paradise is ablaze
Children of progress will prevail upon the crown(Instrumental)(Instrumental)An act of love
When our bodies become one
My standing sword
Hidden in your shelter
Turned into villainy

I rebel against demands
Killing my animalistic nature

Madman I would call a man
Discarding the quintessence of life

No ring no seal no word
But unspoken understanding shall unite us once and for all

Illusory morals have made your bodies congealed 
And the boiling blood never flew through your veins
Sorrowful!

Guidelines of present-day idols -  so unclear, so misshapen
Will we ever cut the leash being held by illusion?

Make your  way through the last days of profound slavery
Take a bow in front of a new god beating back in your mirrorI have risen like a locust storm
The abolish the benevolent disease
To reap upon the earth
A ceaseless demoralizing hellfire
Raping the lands of light
Your towers of glass and steel
Bathed in the light of the sun
Shall bear witness to abomination
As rivers flow with crimson tide
And misshapen beasts fill your streets
So cower far and wide
No place to run, no place to hide
The time of eve draws ever near
No room for cover, you shudder in fear

The dreams of man shall rot and burn
Free of the cloak of imagined morality
They shackle upon your very will
The feral beast inside us all does return
To absolve their millennia of disease

I am the architect of abomination
the captor of souls
I am the architect of anathema
Destroyer of decency
An enlightening of the mind presented
Upon the altar of madness and depravity
the sole reason for mans existence
Is as a creature of my will and amusement

There shall be no fathers
No one for you to run to
In my hand I hold fate and destiny
And i release thee upon my creation
So cower far and wide
No place to run, no place to hide
The time of eve draws ever near
No room for cover, you shudder in fear
I have overtaken like a locust storm
Abolished the benevolent disease
Reaped my will upon the earth
Swept the lands with hellfire
Raping the world of its lightFalling into changes
Do you know what I'm looking for
Wounded by fearless
I stand on the edge and I will __ down (?)
I just can't find the smile (?)

Maybe am I be so one and one be (?)

I'm ___ with myself with fire (?)
Don't know exactly who I am
To fade ___ game was a liar
I ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ I become

Closer my thoughts are deeping (?)
And it be so long that I can't confess (?)
Should I feel moment with you
I will never let you down
I give you all is the truth (?)(Instrumental)I suppose that you're laughing
And you're proud for what you've done
But I tell you it's nothing
Cause I've got a broken heart

Separate ways are better sometimes
Major reason for surprise
Nobody believe in your cries
And the fortune of your lies

Behind the mask
The hidden pleasure of your sins
Feel lost but safe

Kill me, Push the knife inside me
Heal me with your hands
Touch me, let the blood drop stain
The white of winter snow

Cold is the killing hand
Father forgive me
I need you tonight

I'm describing this condition
Every pain and every fear
I believe that your decision
Made the murder crystal clear

Behind the mask you hide
The pleasure of your sins
Feel lost but safe
In the glance of madness

Kill me, Push the knife inside me
Heal me with your hands
Touch me, let the blood drop stain
The white of winter snow

Cold is the killing hand
Father save me
From my sinsWe are tangled in...the web of their lies.
Smell the truth decay. Our purpose...
Rotting away...rotting away.

Rotting away. Rotting away.
Our purpose. Rotting away. Rotting away.
Rotting away.

Chasing synthetic dragons.
Tear the fabric of intention.
The system is not broken.
Its fixed. Fixated on you.

We have raised the sails...in the sea of their lies.
See the truth decay. Our purpose...
Rotting away...rotting away.

Rotting away. Rotting away.
Our purpose. Rotting away. Rotting away.
Rotting away.


Time for us to realize.
Back to truth and sacrifice.
Moving forth and continue to rise.
Sever the ties and come to life.

Material existence.
Divinity shall be forgone.
Material existence.
Diminishing our true essence.

Putting a tag on and selling you.
Eating the shit that there feeding you.Black, black as my mind.
I can't see the light, it's eluding me.
What can you say, when the feeling has gone.
When you're just like me, living in distress.
Black. Darkness inside.
What can you say when the feeling has gone7

Existence running out of sync.
Living out of your time.
Out of your time...

Never, you will never, will never get home,
(out of your time) Never...never get home...

Btack, black as my mind,
I can't see the light, it's eluding me
What can you say, when the feeling has gone.
When you're just like me, living in distress,
Black. Darkness inside.
I can't see the path, it's eluding me,
What can you say when the feeling has gone ?(Instrumental)Short moment of dark
Shroud around us
Starlight creates translucent figures
They move through the misty air
In the warm night of June
Then disappear at sunrise
The reflections of forgotten dreams
They are so clear
In search of their true essence and meaning
We touch the halo that surrounds eternity
As the Sun climbs higher
You needn't be afraid
No winds of autumn reach this land
Love has found its place here
It's in the core of everything
If you stay beside me now
We'll leave those trails of infinite sadness
Put aside all your fearsAs sleep takes my body and will, my true soul
wanders free.
To the stars and beyond...
Time I traverse with my soul to witness the
times before.
When will I see my future, or hear the
whispering tales of the stars.
All the times that I have wandered, I have
been free.
And yet bound by my conceptions of this
existence.
It is not for me to know the secrets of
the cosmos.
And yet, I wonder.
Beaten to concession I fall
Back to where I came, yet none the wiser
This is uor wonder of life, to think all and yet to
know nil
Shall rise like a phoenix from my ashes
Or shall I fade the essence of timeI'll rip the eyeballs from your head
Your innards boiled internally
Cremator flays you one by one
Sending ashes into eternity
Dissector's good with a sharpened hook
I'll gut you like a fish
Fermentor will anatomize
Against your every wish

Your face we'll burn right off your skull
It's my only vice
Decapitated with a scythe
Your bones we'll fashion into dice
Spilled out organs we devour
I eat mine with a frosty brew
Your fate is sealed, as is your tomb
You're really getting screwed

Your death will not be swift
At the hands of the mentally deficient
Slaughtering in the cemetary
We're nothing if not efficient

A knife across your fucking throat
I'll drink right from the slit
The blood is gulped through filthy hoods
And from our fingers licked
A pile of meat is all that remains
Quivering in the crypt
Your splattered torso steaming now
Where flesh has been unzipped

Entombed within the catacombs
Your grave an unmarked open ditch
Decaying in the fetid swamp
Your bones are black as pitch

Maniaxe!!!I know my life is a cynical, logical place
I know the meaning sys hold out to stay in this race
Waiting for someone or something to show me the way
Save me from drowning in something I cannot explain

I know this feeling will likely persist for a while
I know this fever will go down the day that I die
Move in slow motion my hands felt just like two balloons
Waiting for someone or something to take me away

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
Always a moment your run out of time

I know this feeling is momentary state passing by
Sorrow will cover the colour of each others life
Sometimes my life is a journey with no place to hide
One more step closer to something I cannot explain

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
Always a phase where you run out of mind

I close my eyes and I hope that this feeling will change
Walking on thin ice I am crashing into holes of my life
Move in slow motion will help me to balance my day
Silence and tension - I thought that my fight was in vain

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
Facing the moment where you feel the
Fear inside - break the spell tonight
There is always a shelter for you
Fear inside you break the silence
Always one solution you can try"Wahai manusia, sembahlah aku, akulah Tuhanmu."(Instrumental)They pass in silence, under light of moon
Ancient warriors sorrowful and grey
In never-fading shame, yet no cries are heard,
silently they pass
Their one-eyed god is watching, as they pass
through endless forests
They came as warriors from the north,
to claim our shores their own
Enshrouded in lace mist, shields and armour
earth stained
The blood of their wounds, still as crimson as
the day it flowed
They are the norse men that failed
Lost to time forever
Their thirst for war as they came was
unquenched at their failure
When their dragons burned on our shores
They were condemned to sleep beneath our
starlit heavens...The Desert At Night
It makes me die
It freezes me
I long to be free

The sun in the day
It burns my skin
I rot away
Don't know where to beginDid you reached all ready
 The cleanness of your soul and mind?
 If I error concerning you are suicide
 Say me that I`m blind
 You`re like puppet in their hands
 (Clocile sheep)
 They`ll suck out all blood from
 Your veins (until you sleep)
 They will twist the ropes
 From your naive hopes
 Crusify yourself
 Set on fire yourself or
 Pull out your hair
 Jump down from the root
 Or behead yourself and
 I don`t are
 That swindler turned you into
 (Living dead)
 The slippery grubs of madness
 (Is in your head)
 When you`ll look inside your mind
 You will die
 If you want to reach
 The highest bliss
 That you must kill yourself
 If you are so stupid
 In order to stand on knees
 Than I permit you to
 Hate me, hate me
 You wanted to live forever
 But now you had become the dust
 Black smoke is flying to the heaven
 Blame for all your fucking trust
 This is the end
 My devoid friend
 I thind you are consonant
 Hate me begin on yourselfQuagmire entering our orifices
consuming the filth so that the filth can consume
heavy pain on my chest, lack of life filling my lungs
and I slowly die...

Awake in the dirt, aware of your condition
conscious of the vermin causing your decay
faced with eternal torture, the simple price for existing...

Put on this earth to suffer and die
No purpose - nothing to hold on to...

Sift through the madness... only to discover the foulest shit
This shit which holds together the very fabric...
Begotten by the maggots as they obtain control through fear

Existance is worthless - DESTINED TO ROT IN THE EARTHHow Can it be that no matter how I hard I try 
I'll never see the other side 
The light is closing in 
but the darkness never ends too much to comprehend 

The fear of knowing what is real 
overtakes my will to feel 
I'm awake and I must carry on 
an existence of my ownAn intermittent pulse
the defeating rhythm of continuance
Defining abject mediocrity
Surrendered upon a mountain of shit
You're climbing to the peak

Breaking the mould of a social disease
The cries you make across the globe
Self serving narcissist in you fucking tower
Begging for cries of empathy from your onetime friends
The death of man by the cry of a million pussies

So show your status you diseased fucking monkey
Cry out to those who share your symptoms
Your whimpers and moans fuel my disgust
Fill me with what I need to rise above your shit
Laughing at their empathy with a vengeful apathy

I am a soulless monster
With a distaste for ceremony
Feeding on the skeletons you parade
With a craving for your weakness brigade
So stand the fuck up and step aside
Your bullshit will no longer be tolerated
this nation of self serving pussies is tired
Sp wipe your eyes and form a backbone
You don't know fucking pain
You self absorbed pussy fucks.

How about you spend a month in a 3rd world country
Get cancer of the fucking brain
Fight every day for a fucking piece of food
Gain a broader scope of life outside your bloated fucking skull

I'm sick of your shit
I'm sick of your indulgence
I'm sick of your selfishness
I'm sick of your ego-centric fucking bullshit
Stand up and grow a fucking pair
Strength comes from self improvement
Your whiny bullshit breeds decrepitude
And we aren't going to take it anymore(Instrumental)(Instrumental)"Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality."

"Falsity cannot keep an idea from being beautiful; there are certain errors of such ingenuity that one could regret their not ranking among the achievements of the human kind."

"Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man."Senile strained hand ascends over dawn
Trying to reach inanimate faces
And no one ever has felt misanthropy
Freezing ice like igniting pearl

Water flows a sorrow to emptiness
Deriding thoughts from a dead will to the distance
In the time from strength to debility
Little child aligning dead hearts to appeasing air

Nothing's alive nothing stands anymore
There's left only silence and lowness
Everything that they could understand
They deny it over and over

In the state from weakness to perfection
It forces my shoulders harder and lower
If I could I would rise over anguished cries
Over my cry that no one has heard

For the first time the thoughts are escaping
Can you see I'm older and older
Want to leave this century's old day
If the world isn't the inner of myself

I'be been sold
Segregated holocaust
Unaffected
Holocaust of segregation
I'be been sold
Segregated holocaust
Unaffected
Holocaust of segregation
In my own peace

The blood of my heart is dry as a bleakness
Descending down to pieces and pieces
To the ground that encloses nothingness
A hand close to death won't feel the last strain

I'be been sold
Segregated holocaust
Unaffected
Holocaust of segregation
I'be been sold
Segregated holocaust
Unaffected
Holocaust of segregation
In my own peace

Nothing's alive nothing stands anymore
There's left only silence and lowness
Everything that they could understand
They deny it over and over

I'be been sold
Segregated holocaust
Unaffected
Holocaust of segregation
I'be been sold
Segregated holocaust
Unaffected
Holocaust of segregation
In my own peaceCan you feel beyond the horizon
Simplicity soars behind the sun
In which one can evolve from fate
My everlasting hate is day to day
And with the stare from my serpent`s eye
I cast darkness upon your lightening skies
Lighting up the souls who chose thou holy woes
Your final steps shall be walked down this winding road
Capture the thickness that soothes the mind
Like a cloud hazed with thundering cries
Upholding one`s head to withstand the cleanse
I never agreed yet to make amends
It`s time now to take yourself from the strings
The strings from above that have you jumping yet all around
falling deeper. closer to the ground
Cloud formations blackened beneath the eternal eye
Shrouding me over demoralized
Blinding me from the inhuman lies
Slaves driven directly down into the depths
My lust for life remains highly enlightened by human`s death
necrophiliac nuisance sliding through a cataleptic trance
Victimized through worship they cry for the son of man
Unveiling the master plan
The deck is stacked against the holy lamb
Unknowingly they play directly into the Devil`s hand
Dreary visions envelop and swallow the void inside
God`s deceiving lies have been shovelled from the Devil`s sties
Sacramental sewage swept under and away from sight
Only the darkness can bring the light
A broken word from a father too great to save his own son
Is that your lord your god the only one?
There's no shame in the flame
For a few have fallen just the same
Undignified beings must create a new source to blame(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Cheap nostalgia fills your head
Pretend rock and roll isn't dead
Believe in nothing but media lies
When the fuck will you realize

Propaganda Control

Big Brother's hand will seal your fate
His mind works 'cause you've got no brains
Advertising game is a trick on you
They control everything you do

The truth is hard you must realize
Think for yourself what to do with your life
Don't be a part of the corporate scam
Think for yourself while you still canIt's the flesh that I wear 
It's the flesh that I wear 
Use your eyes, and I'll believe 

Swim in the ocean 
Be always obeying 
Live the nothing 
I believe, I believe, I believe 

It's the flesh that I wear 
It's the flesh that I wear 
Use your eyes, and I'll believeI'm lost in here 
 Where no one lives 
 Alone laying here 
 No one will find me 

 Dying wish 
 To live with hope 

 Because no one's here 
 I'm falling asleep 
 Whispering word 
 To fall 
 Fall into me(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Verse) 

Behold the mighty king of metal. 
Mighty warrior, of the night 
The God of men, a man of gods 
Sent to fight the dark horse 

(Chorus) 

In the night, we fight the horse of death. 
The nightmare hellspawn of the slain. 
The dark horse of death will fall to the ground 
And Rawonam rides again 

(Verse) 

Raise your sword, to the sky 
Honor those men who died 
For one has lived, to tell the Tale 
The Tale of Rawonam, all shall hail 

(Chorus) 
In the night, we fight the horse of death. 
The nightmare hellspawn of the slain. 
The dark horse of death will fall to the ground 
And Rawonam rides again 


(solo) 

(Chorus) 

In the night, we fight the horse of death. 
The nightmare hellspawn of the slain. 
The dark horse of death will fall to the ground 
And Rawonam rides again 


whoa oh! Heavy Metal Sing Along! 

And Rawonam rides again.Does it really matter that nothing will live
Truth and lie now you're in their minds
Creeping ahead in this narrow tube
Violence encloses me against the whole system

Can't have a reason to believe them
Dismount away my life deed
How did my mother fly over me
A chain tears apart her head

Creating shock with overload
In forces to escape this sanity
Abstaining from their oppression of pleasure
This is all done in a minute

Fading faster to the immaterial
Happy occasion at the modern time

Using this gone unconscious to save
The manners of your memory
All goes through obeying and bowing
This organization's core is doneOften with a benign curiosity we look to the dreams of men.. Never pondering with any real significance upon the world that exists within our sleep and perhaps it is best left this way. For the things I have seen and heard I cannot unlearn. Though I will do my best to relay them here in hopes that it may provide my own mind with the smallest bit of clarification that I have been seeking for months and have yet to find.
This is a personal documentation of the past year of my life as it has been... Please bear in mind when I say a year that I am referring to solar time such as that of a calendar yet time as I have seen it has been much longer. 
Perhaps even decades as though I am yet to reach the age of 30 my hair is streaked with grey and my skin cracked with wrinkles. I live alone now in a remote and small town where I am no doubt referred to by the local people as an eccentric and perhaps very strange fellow. It is not by chance that I live in such a desolate area for it imperative for my own safety and the safety of others that I am alone with my own diseased mind. It is not my intent that these writings be found or read by any one other than myself. Should you happen upon these writings you would be wise to abandon your reading at this point to save your own sanity and let what I know die with me. It began in the most modest of ways.. I had studied many years in processes of the human mind. It was my goal you see to help people who were besieged by their own minds and unable to help themselves.
I have always held a keen interest with the mind and its secrets. 
Upon graduating close to the top of my class from psychiatry school I soon found a small practice and due to a close personal relationship with one of the local asylums top doctors I would occasionally receive some of the reformed patients upon their re-entering society. 
All was going very well and I had begun to earn a modest living at the job I enjoyed so much. Then one day that all changed. I received a phone call from my doctor friend at the asylum and he asked me if I should like to visit the asylum as he would like my opinion on a particular patient. I of course accepted the invitation eagerly and made off the next eve to see him. 
After arriving the doctor and I spent a small amount of time discussing the patient of interest. He was apparently found wandering outside a small mountain town a couple days carriage ride from here. His hands and face were covered in blood and he was staring vacantly at the sky. He was locked in the local town jail for one night until they may be able to assess his identity and where the blood may have come from.
The first morning the sheriff arrived at the jail he happened upon the man in the cell and noticed that in his sleep he would seizure in very short rapid movements and was uttering something that the sheriff could not quite understand as English.
Within a few days he was transferred to my colleague at the asylum and was observed exhibiting this behavior several more times and upon waking up he would slowly stand with his arms folded across his chest very tightly and stare upwards, sometimes uttering strange phrases.. 
Upon entering the room leading to the patients cell I could not help but shiver due to a rather rapid yet slight drop in temperature... The patient himself was a man of about forty with a ragged and long yellow tinged beard and deep sunken eyes that I could not quite discern the color of. He was a slim fellow with very rigid facial features... It appeared to me as if he had been starving himself for weeks or even months. 
When I entered the room the man's gaze set upon me and as his vacant stare disappeared a look of desperation and woe filled his eyes (which I could clearly distinguish as green now)... 
He began to utter strange sounds which I could not distinguish as English but some other dialect or perhaps not even a dialect at all. My colleague excused himself and remarked that should I need anything I should bang on the door and I will be seen to... At that he left me with the man and we sat staring at each other for what seemed to me to be hours. I could not release my gaze from his eyes. They seemed to swirl with a dark shade that drew me into them. 
All at once the patient then suddenly spoke to me in barely discernable English... His words were minced and yet seemed to make perfect sense all at once. He spoke of visions and dreams which plagued him in even his waking moments. Of unspeakable horrors which tore at his mind until little or nothing remained. 
When pressed on the origin of his visions he would stop speaking suddenly and stare to the sky with his arms folded so tightly across his chest his hands would turn pale with loss of blood. After several hours with the man I returned to ask my colleague if I could spend the night in his room and observe his sleeping moments.. The doctor reluctantly agreed under the condition the man be restrained. 
The first night I observed the man I was astounded to see him in total sleep state open his eyes and stare at me when suddenly with a voice so loud I had to cover my ears lest I fear I should go deaf he began uttering strange words that I had never heard before... even from him... 
The attacks were frequent yet lasted only minutes and the man would close his eyes and lye down once more... By the morning I was exhausted. After at least 50 episodes the sun had stared to flood into the man's room from his thickly barred window. I rose from my chair and was about to ring for the orderly to open the door and permit me leave from this room when all at once I heard a large intake of air from the mans chest and turned to see his face a pale green color and his eyes rolled back into his head... His hair seemed to take on a life of its own and began to whip and twirl as if there was a fan under the mans head... 
I rushed to his side and knelt over him... Looking back now I curse myself for such a thoughtless action for as I knelt before the man his eyes flooded with a black liquid and I felt something that I had never imagined any human could ever feel.. It was as though a hand was coming from this mans body and grabbed my forehead... Then it began. I felt a fire coming through the air and seared with a cold burning sensation that seemed to scorch to deepest part of me.
Then I was gone... My physical body could or would not contain me any longer... The horror I found when my mind retreated from my physical self could not be explained... The forms of unspeakable abominations grasped and clung to me and the eyes? those empty vacuous eyes that held nothing but death and pain... I tried to scream, but no sound would come... I was somewhere else now.. It felt as though I had plunged to the deepest depths of the black ocean only to find the edge of time and space... I was being pulled in every direction at once and if I could have I would have removed my eyes to offer some relief at the horrors that surrounded me... 
All the while the voices... those unexplainable voices that entered my brain though not through my ears were deafening me with sounds of torture... Through it all one voice came to me in clear English and silenced all things surrounding me. The voice was not one of man nor woman... It simply was. 
?Inna sogoth... Mortal you are not known to this world. The one before you had not the capacity to accept the things it saw and thus was an unusable host... Your kind is frail yet here you have come and here you shall stay.. Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."... As quickly as it had come to me it was gone... I woke to find several men standing over me including my colleague who understandable was very pale and full of concern..
Not wanting to alarm anyone I told them that I had been lying there watching the patient and had slipped and fallen when I heard him make those terrible inhaling noises. 
The look in my friends eyes told me he most certainly did not believe me but accepted my excuse anyways...
As I steadied myself I looked over to see the patient lying still strapped to the bed... I asked if he was alright and they informed me he had died shortly after I had my little accident. I didn't know what to think... All I had just experienced was too much at the time for me to accept it as a reality... Though the feelings at the back of my head told me otherwise... 
I left for home shortly after regaining consciousness and was terribly relieved to be back at home in my own manor... I spent the day running errands and trying to distance myself from the events of that morning though the back of my mind could not move past them...
I had a very troublesome sleep that night... If I slept at all.
Visions of the things, shapes and forms I had seen plagued my dreams and that voice... Filled with an emotion I had never experienced before in my lifetime simply replayed itself over and over in my mind... The last thing it said to me especially. I had no idea what it meant but I had the feeling that it was possibly the key to all this horror... 
The next couple weeks passed without anything substantial and I began pushing the thoughts of all of it out of my head finally and then one night after a rather indulgent evening out I was found once more in my sleep... I felt the sensation of drowning and through the blackness I could see eyes... staring at me... some angrily and some appearing to be full of sorrow but all were intently looking to me... Then it happened... I looked down to see lights and what appeared to be a city... There were buildings and apparently manmade structures that existed here... As I descended upon it there was a shrill shrieking noise that pierced my senses and flooded my body with pain.
?human... the city of r'lyeh holds him... dead but dreaming... Cthulhu fhtagn?
It was then that I arrived upon what I guessed was the city of R'lyeh... I spent an immeasurable amount of time there... Most of it I spent in the darkest shadows hiding from the forms that moved through the alleys and buildings... I had no idea why I was there or what brought me to that place... I just wanted out... Then it happened. I came upon a large open area and in the middle of this area was a circle with strange symbols inside of it... One was a star and also some partially formed triangles... When I stepped upon the circle I was suddenly awake in my bed.. Covered in sweat and trying to catch up to my breathing... And the sky opened and giant tentacles came from it... Something was coming out.. I screamed in horror and fell to the floor and then I saw it... A giant arm first and then the head of it... It was that of a sea monster... An almost human face surrounded by tentacles and emitting the smell of the dead.. It was then that my mind finally shut down... and visions of the apocalypse haunted me... The world is a sea of flames and cloud... Unspeakable horrors befalling all of mankind as it walked among us... 
I spent much time in that world of death... So much now that I am unaware of life's true reality... And still they come to me... Dead but dreaming?They come to me... As I sit here now and prepare to finish the last of this testimony I cannot help but think back to that patient and hope for my end to come soon... Perhaps I will get in touch with my old friend at the asylum.. I'm sure I would be quite the study...
Still it calls.. It finds me where I hide and I can no longer run... Death is waiting and I have many miles to travel...In my head, distant thunder rolls on,
Blue thunder with distant hooves.
Cloud formations in my head,
Are looking set to burst anytime.

A satellite in time, drifting on the waves.
Eternally spinning round and round.
You can't find me, far away.
And your mind cannot say which way I am,
For I am gone...

"I'm drifting and spinning on the web of thought,
trying to anchor onto something of substance.
Now I am falling like an angel from grace,
but with a soul-felt emotion of being free..."

A paranoid fly on the wall,
I cannot be caught by mysterious webs.
At sundown I travel to the stars,
To gather my disciples at the sonic boom.

Gods of blue thunder, riding chariots of gold.
Super-sonic sound blast, heed one and all.
Sub-atomic lightening, it shatters your soul,
And it's echo resounds on and on and on and on...(Instrumental)She's flying
On a wind of
Desperation filling time
With inspiration
Seeking wisdom
Followed by barbed wire bell
Into shadows
Who can tell?

Lost in floating
Streams
Seeing things

Contending
Into the night
Gathered feeling
Gathered continue sight
Gathered continue deep
The weeping sleep and lost forever is the soul

Climbing deep
Lost forever in the soul
Lost forever in the goal
Lost in the nightmare grow
Down into the nightmare grow
Down into the nightmare grow





Flying
On a wind of Desperation
Following by barbed wire bell
Into shadows
Who can tell?
Lost in floating stream
Seeing things
Creeping things
Dash away

Oh light
Oh sight
Gathered to fight
Contending
I am able to fight


I am able to fight
Gathered continue deep
The weeping sleep
Lost in the soul
Climbing deep
Singing leap
Fall down
Fall down into the nightmare grow
Fall down into the nightmare grow
(c) C. Poupoutsi 2012Raping me and my friends for our weed 
Smoke your life away, driven my greed 
Selling your shit for a small cash in 
What you need is a good fucking thrashin' 
I'll beat you 'til you're black and blue 
Forensics won't have a clue 
Bleeding from your mouth, your eyes 
Screaming to me 

I want to die 

Melting brain pushing through your skull 
Radiation glow, now you're not so dull 
Once he's granted you the highest power 
Your soul he'll take and slowly devour 
Pizza dick, paint a target on his back 
Smash him now with a sweet attack 
When you see the hate filled up in my eyes 
You will see it's you that I truly despise 

Bound and gagged 
This is your demise 
Pray for your god 
Pray to the skies 

He can't help you now 
6ft underground 
Maggots feed on your corpse 
That's where you'll be found 

It's kill or be killed(Instrumental)Impotence against reality
Your mind see, your mind feel
But your mind can change your destiny
The wait, the rage and this is for...
Revenge!Sick 
To my stomach and mind 
To find I'm already in hell 
And I'm spiraling down 
A worm-hole's 
Never ending curve 
Turning end over end 
Let me out 
Won't you please? 
Let me loose of this 
Spiraling dream 
Continuation entrapment 
Caught in a perpetual sewer 
Corridor of concrete flesh 
A flaming vomit simulation 

Tell me am I 
Just another 
Mechanical tool 
Made to and for the cycle? 
Perpetual motion machinery 

Set to clean 
Set to clean 
Set to clean 

Scatter me in pieces 
Free my spirit out 
Shatter me in ruins 
Rid me free of doubt 

I beg you please 
Release me of this 
Cubicle abomination 
Make me nothing 
Cancel me delete me 
From all recollection 
Mend my suffering 
Rid me loose of all this 
Agony ever circling 
Its way around me 

Around me 
Ever circling its way 
Around me 

Scatter me in pieces 
Free my spirit out 
Shatter me in ruins 
Rid me free of doubtLovely creature I cannot resist
Twisted web of maiden witch
Need to see her all undressed
She has something to confess
I know well just who you are
Mark of satan not a scar
Sadistic intent masked as god
After death we crawl in the mud(Instrumental)Hey it's me again
So lets not pretend
That we can mend that we can send this pain away

I suffered so long
Please take this pain away

Save me from ignorance my black and blue romance
It's faithful and pleasant and fooled by circumstance

You mustered up the sun again
Whispered the sounds of time
Feeding the mind with rhymes
Then vanished again

Lovely irrelevance that keeps us interested
While moving slowly in hast, yet patient

I lost my innocence
Disappear hesitance
It warns me it warned me
It warns me to fear

Safe from ignorance, my black and blue romance
It's faithful and pleasant and fooled by...

CIRCUMSTANCE

Always gets its way
So lets all pray
This love's here to stay
Silence wants me to fade away

You were not supposed to know
The cycle begins againSearching for the lifeless
The departed
Are my own

Not Breathing
But still seeking
For one final place to rest their heads

A past so long buried
Forgotten wounds worsen in time
The dead will cry to be revived
Beckon you to join their side

Waiting

Waiting for a hand
To guide them to the promise land
Afterlife, there's only hell
A barren land where shadow's dwell

Endlessly

A place of nightmares waits
Unresting place

Restless are the breathless
Searching for peace in this paradox
Crazed fear of the unreal
Grips us all until we become one

Your death bed's an open door
That leads to the other side
Nothingness, Eternally
There's no hope you can be freed

Locked In

Trapped inside, scream in vain
Can the dead go insane?
This is your fate, no need to wait
Soon enough is still too late

Join Them Now

You sacrifice yourself
To save their souls

SOLO: Fischer

Possess to be reborn
Live your life through captured minds
You will be heard, and us in turn
Use their voice to speak your words

Death is foreshadowed by life

Cannibals engaged to make you a horrible death,
Cannibals good cook : tasty smell of toasted flesh,
I 'm just one of these "cordons bleus"
You know, 'miss me so I eat a delicious feast!Record what transpired
Don't let those who follow,
deduce in strain
Let the disc illustrate,
why our children's bones are flayed
Our axes fell not in vein

When the water retreated,
star shaped stomachs remained
Digesting those too slow
The rest were simply maimed

Sadistic spines on hellacious hides
A sting would mean,
extra arms growing from your sides

Ceremoniously,
we severed each ill placed limb
And buried them deep,
so as not to crawl again

Let the disc serve as warning
Never unearth these graves
For I fear our progeny,
would sprout from the remainsThe precincts of the city have rotted
The work of giants is rotting away
No coiled gold
Nor splendors of the earth
No ravening grey wolf
No sad-faced man tasked with burial
One easily divorces what was never united
Body from body
Particle from particle
The world falls apart into facts
Time fades away
Grown dark under the helm of night
As if it had never beenObssessed by what they see on TV
Drugged up with the fucking magazines
Idealism of beauty, imposed perfection
All this shit trusted by a retarded generation
"Be like that or be nothing !"

Can you feel the fatal destiny ?
The shame of being yourself
The fright of being rejected
The dry taste of exclusion
Its cold breath in your flesh

Being different is often a hard price to pay
The despair of staying unloved forever
Chained by a thick loneliness
Unkown and nameless creatures
Lost in the dark marches of the nothingness

Despised by the fashion fanatics
You don't exist on that rotten earth
Nobody wnats to know you
Your world is too ugly
For this lobotomized herd

The stupidity is out of limit
For whom the eye is the first judge
Of what they see
For those who don't know how
To hink by themselves

Fuck you !!!Pt I

Above the black land
Above people of blackness
Above black weather
Above relations of black

Under the black sky
Beneath the black stars
Under the gods of black
Below the void of black

The black sun

Are the eyes closed?
Or rather just picked?

Pt II 
I scoop a handful of black earth
With fingers I touch the black glass
I kiss my hands and lips of black
Chew black meat and bread in my mouth

Even white coffins of blackA pulsative universe
A gauntly breath
The birth of life
An unaccustomed process

The scar evolution
Based on routine mistakes
The human race
Was never inspired

A matter of luck
And divine coincidence
A mortal idol
That inhaled consciousness

The atrocity of war
The triviality of death
How did you manage?
To rule the earthSome sights remain unseen, 
though fundamental is their meaning. 
Slipped through the fingers of vapid cynics, 
who fancy themselves philosophers. 
A display of unearned ideas, 
stolen by clammy hands, 
and earned by calloused ones. 

Wiser in my ignorance am I, 
than those trained in lies. 
A white shell. 
A thin veil. 
A lingering rot, 
masked with perfume. 

Impaired by arrogance, 
and hatred, 
unable to see, 
the simplicity with which your life takes it's course; 
And takes flight in the form of us all. 

A flutter of wings. 
The loss of a feather. 
It is I who understands. 
Trees tear from the earth, 
the wind gives breath to man, 
and the sun to us all spills the ink; 
And the call is answered by nothing. 
And so it is and forever was, 
simple. 
And so it is and forever was, 
Nothing.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Lies consuming
 Ideals falling
 Wrath inside growing
 The puzzle is scrambling

 Blinfolding
 Hate becomes consuming
 Me versus the world
 Composition is interesting

 Ohh ultimate destruction
 Last war
 For chocolate bar they are fighting
 Wrong leader is leading

 You are my ride away
 Personal angel of death

 End misery

 Listen emperor talking
 Flood gates opening
 And after a second
 Damage is done

 You are my ride away
 Personal angel of death
 Please format c
 End misery

 Desire for destruction
 Pleasure from chaos
 Lust for armageddon
 MePlease forgive me, for I've been gone
For far too long, to the other side.
I was searching for somebody else,
But all I found were reflections of myself.
Apologies - Escapologies,
There's no place like home.(Instrumental)Vast ray of light
Warm amidst the shell
Take the breath out of me
I just want to be free
I just want to be free

You are my saviour
Hope within an abysmal darkness
Always and never
Butterfly - a blinding lie

Poison the senses - denial
So comfortable in hell
We will never be free

Put the gun to my head
All I ever want to see - butterflies...Trapped upstairs waiting to heal. 
Trapped upstairs waiting to feel. 
Numb calves in a stumbling haze. 
Crippling pain that lasts for days. 
Pressure leashed by palisades 
of muscle wall which, slashed by blades 
of chronic cough and social silence, 
GI tract punched through the violence. 

BREACH! 
Thoracic breach. 
Friends hurting friends. Wits at their ends. 
A season half lost. Sewn up and tossed away. 

Weakness genetic in origin. Rotted by illness and business demands. 

Shaved like Samson, swabbed and gassed. 
Incarceration ends at last. 
Shocked awake by searing pain. 
Stabbing needles in my brain. 

BREACH! 
Thoracic breach. 
Friends hurting friends. Wits at their ends. 
A season half lost. Sewn up and tossed away. 

1 2 3 4 Go!I hear the 
Water 
Backfire 

Drawn to the clouds 

Violently dilapidated ozone 
Can't hold ultraviolet from the sun back 
In anticipation of a dead half life 
Chlorine deep inside of me 
This pale outcropping of water 
Sounds a death rattle for us all

For everything a last time.(Instrumental)You like the danger and so you return 
To touch the fire, but the fire will burn 

You will see Only what I want you to see 
You will hear Only propaganda 
that I want you to fear because.. 
You like the danger and so you return To touch the fire, the fire will burn 

you will see 
Clear and present danger is real 
It's under your skin, and it's over your head 
And your fallin apart as you find that I'm all around 
Fire - Get closer to me 
Fire - Feel my third degree 
Fire - No matter what you say 
Fire - You cannot break away 

Time is not your friend Your moment has arrived 
Power is mine to give If you want to survive 
Believe the lie and forget the truth 
Will you live or die 
Power I give, or your right to survive 

Feel the burn all around 
Let it take you higher Fire - Get closer to me 
Fire - Feel my third degree 
Fire - No matter what you say 
Fire - You cannot break awayDedicated to kids born at the times of the dawn of the Soviet Empire)

Standing on the edge of this industrial world
Looking through the wall of eternal fog
Deadly sun burns slow I feel you are so old
Filled with nuclear poison, covered with toxic smoke

Black skies squizing me I can hardly stand
Air that I am breathing; now burning my lungs
Trying to close my eyes full of dust and sand
I am calling for the rain that never comes

I am lighting the fire
And I am burning the past
I am leaving forever
I don't want but I must

Smoke's getting higher
Nothing's left of before
But only my heart
Now it hurts even more

Watching some children playing in the ashes
Drops of fire raining from the burning soldier toy
My past hunts me again, my memory flashes
Once upon a time I played this way as a boy

Thinking of this now but my thoughts dying fast
Nothing I can change so what else remains?
Dusk arrived as fallen curtain to eat away my past
I will find it once again in eternal flames.meeting the elder ones

From day till day
From hour till hour
another personality
A lost identity

I... I am lost
I am waiting for the eternal search
I... I am afraid of myself
I have no life I want to die

Terrible pains inside
Constantly voices from nowhere
Good and evil are the same
Suddenly rising from where they came

Visions....
Visions of my religion
Visions of the anti-christ
who shall be... there next time

I want my old life back
I want my second soul to go
Don't wan't to be a slave
of the dark one
Rotten brains, flashes of death
before my eyes
There is no place for me
my last hope.. is to die!

An.. An empty soul in light
An empty soul in darkness

Terrible pains inside
Constantly voices from nowhere
Good and evil are the same
Suddenly rising from where they came

Alone and confused
Please tell me who am I

Suicidal tendencies are teasing
nobody will understand
Two different thoughts
The opposite of eachother

Visions of my religion
Visions of the anti-christ
who shall be... there next time

The pains inside me
I don't want this eternal fight
I want to life my own lifeEverything is balanced well
Life and death equal scales
Peaceful silence lights all spheres
But
Ignition
Perdition
Unrest shakes the ancient grounds
There goes a new messiah

There is a day to come
The pathway into our own demise concludes
And our work is done
The mother of all speech silences our words
And earth awakes on a perfect day

Everything we multiply
Nothing but a spark in time
Only leaving insignificance
But
Ignition
Extinction
Exponential orgasm of life

Assume de boekhouding!
Kapitaalschuim!(Instrumental)When I open the door in my chest and let enter the plague and death
My lungs inhale vast screams, every cell filled with downfall
I'm the gate for the lost travelers, the exit for hopeless men
Break your spears and leave your swords
Swallow the poison and walk through me
This is the eve of the battle that will change this world
Kingdoms will drown in blood and a new order will be born
I'm the gate for the lost travelers, the exit for hopeless men
Break your spears and leave your swords
Swallow the poison and walk through me
Blades grow from my fingers, my feet are the watchtowers
Use my eyes as beacons for the salvation painted red
Because this is the sacrament, the last landmark
Leave your body, carry your soul
Walk the path inside of me, soles cut by the sacred thorns
Smell the stench of victory in your burned and rotting flesh
This is the purest form of triumph
When you fall to your crushed knees
Nothing left to feast or share, just the barbed throne of pain
Leave your body, carry your soul[404]

The Web as a holistic approach
for us to collect all information
A dream of more accessible world
in this cybernetic ivory tower

Powerless as it appears at our monitors
The world of imperfectness, the world of ours

3 digits on a dialing code
to access departments of rescue
Numbers known for help-assistance
related with a social security

Lines of governmental services
working in a complete duty
Units seemed to be flawless
with funds that appropriately flow

Still, the world who never sleeps,
it will never give up its darkside
Even the rescue code can be taken
as a symbol to create one big tragedy

When the very eyes of the world
moved by a singular defining moment,
those numbers became a point for another meaning
at time when people both cry or rejoice
in the awakening of war!

[70x7]

How often shall we forgive?
Up to 3 times? Up to 7 times?
No, it is up to 70x7

We hear a sound of weakness in our minds
The rhythm of the twilight, and rhythm of the night
To give the guilty ones their second lives
And death was only price, a suffering and pain
for us, the unforgiven who get redeemed for free
So can't we give our "enemies"
the unconditional state of forgiveness?

To forgive is to be hurt
To forgive is to suffer

Whore of many subjects
Your face is my canvas
So with every stroke
And with every grasp
You'll lose more than you will gain
Master is my only name

View my world behind the veil
Leather strikes your bleeding tail
Choke on what I feel for you
Inches deep and turning blue

My disgusting physical pallet
Heartless cunt, whom now reviled
I strip you of all self worth
On your knees and in the dirt
Do not ask me to restrain
When all you've given me is pain
Grinding you into a pulp
Hands wrapped 'round your dying throat

Who are you to contemplate?
Take your punishment, ingrate
Each blow brings me closer to you
Dressed in skin that's black and blueIn the air. Prayers, confessions. 
Tools of pacification. Of a silent dark.

Cleaning your soul of dreams full of death. 
Each day you rise, your redemption. 
And your scars will continue bleeding.

And you believe. That the time will heal to you. 
It will erase your wounds. And that your lies will be hidden.

Your fears aren`t mine. And I blame to you. 
Your lies will be the same mine. It won`t resign. 
To a God that doesn`t want to be my God
 I won`t resign.To a hell to live. Just mine to live. 
Your sins burn my skin. Like silent shouts. 
When forget you it. I don`t find my peace.

Rigid silhouettes. 
It move within a dim light.
Devious movements in its eyes. 
The breath goes away with the lies.
Closing the book for the final words.
Liquid that runs by your back.
Drawing a line of confusion.
Congealed fingers mark its wrecks
This is its liberation.Baby when we're together
Everythin' is just so right
And when you hold me and caress me
Gently through the night

No matter what happens around me
You always pick me up
You're always right there by my side
So I'll never give you up

Do you remember
The starry night with me
The dawn on the sea
That felt so right
How could we be wrong
I never felt so strong, I love you

No more silent sorrow
No blue tomorrow
The winding road that we ride
Is just a rainbow through the sky

Remember that night when you told me
The Earth needs the sun
The sun's unable to shine
Unless your love fills my heart (chills my heart)

I need your love
In the sea of emotion
You fill my heartHardware of slavery, treadmill of dogma 
A realization of the Orwellian dream 
Among the blind and under scrutiny 
Adjuncts figment as auspicious 

Sense the omnipotence of function 
Restless whims of mechanistic affairs 
Laid to waste by regulated proxy 
From a subordinated perspective 
Dubious problems from which disillusion projects 

Obstruction 
Collage 
Being 
OccludedBled dry are the waters of Jordan
Crumbled now golgitha
Ransacked are the ancient Citys TURNED TO RUBLE
The oasis of Jesus now destroyed

Through the eyes of Azazel i watch there end
One by one the churches crumble
Holy civilization destroyed
Nothing now but worthless smoldering bricks

(chorus)
Tearing down the framework of idiocrisy
Iconoclasts Of the ancient ways strike
Sign of the horns in the distance
The feeble threefold spirits overthrown!

Let the blood of the shepherd overflow the rivers
Let the head of the god of man roll
Set ablaze on his meaningless cross
Cthulhu Awaiting in the mist for its holy sacrifice

 For its time to Thou Now Show Thy Power"

Paranoia near omniscient 
Updated files accessorize 
Flow my tears, the policeman said. 

Flow my tears 
Along the platform track, narrow blind line 
Hostage management a formula, for a new kind of lifeless life 

Assimilation seen through 
To an incomplete, a prototype, rote. 
Infocentric time line driven 
Ready? Die.A war of lies infest my dreams
Ghost weapons that make me sick
The preacher calls for duty
For breakfast to the lord you will kneel
Raise your rights for mediocrity
Bow, pray and obey

These are the rightful commands
That forge the shit you are everyday
Puppets are freedom's enemies
The strings that are tied to your soul
Your advices are poison to me
Step aside for I'm cross tormentor

Ch:  
Cross tormentor - Born to desecrate you blind
Cross tormentor - You''ll be consumed right before my eyes!

Institutionalized slavery, the path that leads your soul
Cowards! You build your own sancuary from fear, lies and mind control

Brainwashed in chains your highest ambition
Your pathetic vision cast in the rocks of time
Empty believes, gospel of the sheep, pervert's benediction
Moral infestation, the cross tormentor will draw the line!(Eklundh)

Sanity takes a vacation
You're on your own from now on
Exploring the cracks inside you
Primitive mind...

One step towards separation
One step towards confrontation
Exploring the cracks inside you
Primitive mind...

I'll stun your resistance
I'll drown you in lies
Your waiting is over
Tear it, tear it, agonize

Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking's on your mind 

I'll stun your resistance
I'll drown you in lies
Your waiting is over
Tear it, tear it, agonize 

Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking hour's here now
I'll spank your mind right here now
Spanking's on your mind(Instrumental)We ride towards the open West
Grave of the weak, Hell for the rest
A serpent's eye shines on the shaft of my Colt
Satan shoots you down with a burning bolt

A silver bullet screams avenging my brother
If you don't want to die go home to your mother
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad

We ride towards the haunted West
Tomb of the meek, Hell for the rest
Where women are loose and gold abound
Death is the friend of the meanest band around

This is the desert where our legend began
A bottle of whisky for the life of a man
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad

Whipping our horses on towards the West
End of the frail, Hell for the rest
When gold is the matter we are your men
Let Destiny settle if or when

Rivers of blood, churchyards of dust
We kill if we have to and die if we must
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad

We ride towards the haunted West
Tomb of the meek, Hell for the rest
Where women are loose and gold abound
Death is the friend of the meanest band around

This is the desert where our legend began
A bottle of whisky for the life of a man
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Weird tenderness struck me with her kiss
beating warmness
knocking smell of sourness

swelling thorns covered my hands
swinging shades with colours

the scent of coldness is of clay
the memory of her is of moonface

(knock knock knock)

O invisible tenderness!
rushing towards behind a tree
I have (all) your fingernails in my hand

I'm turning upside down!In my mouth the winds were gone in a moment's time
Men never saw them or heard their sweet rhyme
Their sweet rhyme...

We felt their presence during daytime bliss
So we slept and dreamt of night in serpent's warming kiss
A soothing kiss...

What you cannot see
What you will not see
That all you shall dream
That is all you shall dreamPosed to reinvent
Liquids mauve, sometimes mere
Cavorting but cold and
Lucky to know their origins
Tumbling wreckage
Undo underneath where symptoms war
Collude in atoms to
Retrofit evolution's disclosure
But know how qualities maim
And coax bitterness
Without but without and 
A cough when blessed to churn
Can ameliorate none but the deaf.Inside the church is the smell of ages,
incense smoke and deviation
Old pictures, silent whispers,
submission and deviation.

The name of christian religion
is blemished again.
One of the ten commandments
has been dishonoured.

Holy desecration
Sacred deviation

It seems now that christian members
live quietly a wild life.
The sacred bible and commandments
are only for the church mice.

A priest to a second priest sucks his dick,
a preacher to a pastor kiss his ass.
So where is the selibacy?
Where is godly humility?
Parsons abuse our young boys,
nasty actions in sacred places.

What is the idea
and face of christianity?
Profane love is the love between
man and woman
compared to the love between
God and humanity.(Instrumental)1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,
what comes next...10.
Yeaaah!
Stick it to 'em one more time Shagazz.(Instrumental)Why oh why?
Floating inside my exsistence
Floating away thru time inside my mind.
Come the day the light will be upon you
The road it travels far and wide
The goal I see you shinning
Oh your so wonderful
Journey full of wonder you help me rise
Oh your so wonderful
Journey full of wonder you help me rise...

Battle of the spirits
No more I need to say
You try to make me weak
Your power wrapped you sneak
Rape all you can from women and man
weapons and arrows your torturing plans

Filth rotten, in decay not forgotten
Strong Your stench spew
Your posionous lies,
Traverling in darkness
With shadows for eyes,
Open down deep, the first beneath
Swim therein your whirlpool of shit
And then no more, the silence bell
Submit to heaven your living hell
Where lives within your cunting fucking smell

Why oh why?
When darkness dwells in hidden
Without expression ridden
Convincing you to stay
Pain and torture driven

What is evident in void
We live, we learn, Wr Trust and in turn
What we find is not real,
In moments sereal
Hidden in darkness
The truth to it all,
A complicared puzzle
Uncoded for fools.
Pure from filth
That lives within your claw
Cold and lonely
Miserable whore
Save yourself and let me be
You do not see what I see
You can never be me
Stop trying stop trying stop tryingKings across the sea
Coming for your land
Sending mighty armies
Come to take your homes
Inhabitants of your lands
Fighting for their lives
Smashed to the ground
By the over-powering

Leaders march their armies
Taking all your cities
Crusade across the sea 
To rule a new land
Hopeless battle lost
Supremacy to reign
Bringing forth a god...
A god for your worship

See the Kings....
In purple robes
Sat aloft
On golden thrones
Gods among men
Dominating
Gods among men
Forever conquering

Ancient rituals torn away
Dictatorship enforced
Follow the new order 
Brought from foreign lands
Bringing forth advances
Bringing forth the wise
Technology so superior
That lived in your dreams...

Deserted lands left by Kings
Constructions still stand
Left for the memory
Of this conquered land
Summoned by their Emperor
To go and save their homes
Land left to be haunted
Haunted forever more.......(Instrumental)Midnight six sixty six

GONE AS YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATHIt seems so easy and it seems so wrong 
Some say they'd rather just run along 
But what I say to them's so great 
Though it takes a special human trait 
They want a solution to every problem 
But with that solution I would not be welcome 
As I'd rather do as I would say 
And line my stomach with adhesive clay 

And I take it that you 
Aren't into solvents 
Though I take it that you 
Would not condone it 
Though I take it that you 
Just want an answer 
So therefore you should 
Take an enhancer 

When your car breaks down 
Or been in a fist-fight with a clown 
You know there' a problem 
And what to do 
Grab a tube and eat wood glue 
Perhaps you broke your expensive door 
Or received a package that isn't yours 
You know there' a problem 
And what to do 
Grab a tube and eat wood glue 

And so we've landed here again 
You're tied to the train tracks 
There's an oncoming train 
So don't think about it, don't question your gut 
For your gut's going to deal with some pastey much 
And so it may not taste good, and so it may not taste great 
Well simply say 'fuck it', or face that oncoming fate 
Or would you rather do as I would say 
And line your stomach with adhesive clay 

And I take it that you 
Aren't into solvents 
Though I take it that you 
Would not condone it 
Though I take it that you 
Just want an answer

If your rabbit has died

I think I could turn and live with animals,
they are so placid and self-contain'd,
I stand and look at them long and long.

They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of
owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of
years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.Know me broken by my master
Teach thee on child of love hereafter

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Drifting body it's sole desertion
Flying not yet quite the notion

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way


Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone?
And left you here alone?

If I would, could you?battle within begin. life after life. death after death.
suffer. die. resurrect. all those karmas in my face.
further and further away from grace.
cut to pieces. death house walls me in.
bodily dismemberment. renewal of organs. celestial ascent.It deteriorates to the point of indefinable shadows
Nothing left from which to feed this basic contemptibility

I have come from the bowels of the earth
Born unto this world by the marriage of disgust and rage
To feed the flames and stoke the fires of his will
I am the anti-divinity and true soul of man

To spread my crimson wings upon the earth
Draping an inescapable shadow over all of humanity
Concealing all light from an already shaded course
Drown all in a void where none may enter and none shall escape

There be no feeling in men which I have not cultivated
There be no thought in men which has not been given
Pass unto me the symbol of your deity
Be repentant unto the cross as you burn
Inhale the sulfur of our new torment and prepare for eternity

Welcome our faustian spirit of the earth
the binding of flesh and fire
Wreaking is affliction upon every screaming nerve
A marriage of pain and horror

There be no redemption here you whores of the flesh
Your erroneous ideology has hastened your descent
O' children of god you're welcome to Milton's paradise lost
Welcome to the meal of saints.. The eternal feast

The unity of black souls, a creeping of fractures
The source is hidden, the undefined shadows
Children of tomorrow
Eternal eyes of the goat

I have come from the bowels of the earth
Born unto this world by the marriage of disgust and rage
To fee the flames and stoke the fires of his will
I am the anti-divinity and the true soul of man

As the locusts gather, the flies surround flesh
The viper's venom courses
Imprisoned in blackOnce upon a storm
An old man came to me
And in a twisted tongue
He told the prophecy
"A young man will arise
From the common folk
To end all tyranny"
Were the last words
He ever spoke

Yesterday we showed them mercy
This cursed day we gave our lives
Yesterday we fought for freedom
Melancholy in our eyes
Victory or Valhall
The gods will choose

Our gods stand beside us
Our gods they will guide us
Our gods fight with us
Our gods won't betray us

Now I open my eyes
And I see the blood-red sky
Look at the pain around me
This ain't what I am fighting for
My brother's eyes are empty
Melancholy in their eyes
I can barely hear them screaming
Melancholy in their eyes

Open the gate to
Welcome us all
Embrace our fate in
Odin's great hall
No one will remain
Behind the golden door
Freedom we will find
Forevermore

Victory or Valhall
We can never lose
Victory or Valhall
The gods will choose
Victory or Valhall
In the great warrior's hall
Victory or Valhall
I hear the great gods call

Open the gate to
Welcome us all
Embrace our fate in
Odin's great hall
No one will remain
Behind the golden door
Freedom we will find
Forevermore

A chill creeps through my body
And now it downs on me
How to win the battle of life

[Solo Jan]

Open the gate to

Embrace our fate in

I scream my heart in hollow words was I didn't know before
I sang my song just to clarify
Let you were be cold this hollow words I told you so before

But tonight I'm nothing

I know, I sense the time
Tonight I'm nothing

I know, I sense the time
Tonight I'm nothing

I never thought we'd would regain
I should have known that something's gonna happen today
I can't control anything I said
Life is full of darkness and regrets has come my way

But tonight I'm nothing

I know, I sense the time
Tonight I'm nothing

Behind the fields
The shudders sing their climbing blow

To the glowFog,
take your misty clothes off
the windswept hearts of men.
Sun, fail me not
and I'll go out to the wood every night.

Wild nature- lay your laws down.
As above, so below.
I'm dark, the stars and clouds, the Night in the shape of a man.

Standing in the secret Earth,
there's wind in my dream.
There's a mist in my house.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Ben zi bena
Counting roots and worms
The sound of slowly rusting metal
The whisper of the rocks
Yesterdy seems thousand of years ago

Bluod zi bluoda
Chants of an old woman in white
This leg won't come off
Winds blow above my head
Seasons change
Though I do not notice
At night I hear the Hares dance
Though I can but imagine the moon

Lid zi geliden
I can still hear the footsteps
Of those who placed the rocks
I can still see the sword
That entered my head
But I can't remember the pain
I can still see the stars
I count them: one for every day
Fortunately, there are plenty

Sose gilimida sin
I keep my sword sharp
For I will have need for it again...In eternity, I'll cause pain
My burned soul, fulfills hate
I'll grab his hand, play his war game
Those cozen eyes, I am his aim

Why change this unreal? I am lost in a void
I think it's surreal, my soul is destroyed
A world into haze, words are in a grieve
I am deluted, by death's own deceive

Forsaken years, I haunted life
I obsessed birth, in blood I dive
When will this end? I want to die
To rest and cry, my goodbye!

Why change this unreal? I am lost in a void
I think it's surreal, my soul is destroyed
A world into haze, words are in grieve
I am deluted, by death's own deceive

In eternity, I'll cause pain
My burned soul, fulfills hate
I'll grab his hand, play his war game
Those cozen eyes, I am his aim(Instrumental)when I look around now what do I see
the faces around they won't answer me
the bit I know is just a part of entirety
show me a place from where I can see all
take me to places above, take me away

when I look around I stop making a move
people as far as my eyes can see
I feel the world is passing me by
take me to somewhere out in the sky
where I can see all
take me to places above, take me away

The world I know the ways that I go
Won't take me away to a foreign sight
I spread my wings and fly as high as a satellite
Circle around like a bird of prey

Can you see something
Right when you look into the light
Let's take a view from a distance
Right into the mist of the night

See the sunrise - raise your head
Keep your distance - break your window pane

When I look around I stop taking a breath
I'm breaking the seal of secrecy
The people around they just walk on by
Measure the size of an empty space

So tired of feeling something
So tired of the tragical life
Let's take a view from a distance
Right into the mist of the night

Will you follow/ will you care?
Will you sorrow? Will you dare?(Instrumental)Hot diggidy dog!

I wish for a beast
A sacrifice to please a god
Must claim my right
to the Cretian throne.
Given to me was not a beast
But a gift
A sacred white bull
My worth upholds
I have kings rule now
Slay a lesser cow
Not unnoticed
Poseidon plans
As she sleeps, she dreams
To lay the beast
Open her eyes
Between her thighs

Mary had a little lamb, the fleece was white as snowSorrow shades a bunch of love herbs
Who taugh you love in the Night?
I harvest a bunch of love herbs.

You shattered behind a bunch of love herbs
I explored my part of them, sprayed the light
We mourn upon a bunch of love herbs.

Sovereign under a bunch of love herbs
a fag(g)ot of henbane lighted up a fight
I steal my bunch of love herbs.

Raise the token with a bunch of love herbs
Night erased those clouds from my sight
Vitality gnaw our bunch of love herbs.

Sow a bunch of love herbs
murder buried, blood from your breast shed
They sit upon a bunch of love herbs.

Sour weeds, burdened Cicatrices
I inhale the backdoor rumble
Hoar flow, trashy shells
I rend my bunch of love herbs
They 'd cry from distance
My love for you embeded in a shriekThe journey ended, the time has stopped
And I feel nothing. I am nothing.
I shall never realize that I am one
Of the creatures made of smoke
EVANESCINGHalo guards leave you, black ether embraces you. The seed under the frost, gathering slaves and tears. Heart-shaped seed, chambers full of anguish. Wasteland of altruism, potential for the catharsis. Rambling through these days like hanging with the ravens, like gazing to my own grave and seeing the emptiness. Mysterious... So bewitching... Myriad of colours... When has pain taken a so beautiful form?(Instrumental)Larilah wahai Bangsa;

Lari, lari, lari!Through The Shadows I Clearly See 
By Itay Necrofog Krasilchikov

Through the shadows
I clearly see
Through the shadows
I clearly see

The woods, home of mine
My peace within turmoil
A world in flames
My soil forever remains

Through the shadows
I clearly see
Through the shadows
I clearly see

A cemetery of living spirits
Floats within me
When the moon rises 
Their clamor torments my soul

Wrath grows
Nails bury inside the skin
Power intensifies
A power of an ancient king

The one that sees through minds
Controls their future, the damned
The one truth behind the counterfeit
He stands tall, for he is dead!

Gaze upon the conflagration
Relinquish all determination
Hell on earth has arrived
Now the time of Satan will thrive!

Now the time of Satan will thrive!

In darkness forever we shall be
Through the shadows I clearly see!Slender the light we ride for, steel eyes 
 Inmortal the riders we are 
 Millions the bastards we hate 

 Stardust fragment 
 Lost horizon 
 Stars and comets 
 Absent cry 

 She was my grieving, she was the weeping 

 Show us how to spell those two-fold minds 
 Lost and running, stop this turning(Instrumental)It's payback time. He stole your rake, you'll steal his soul.

Time for the rake-fight. Fernando take no prisoners!

It was a blood bath

He killed everyone

He's fuckin' hungry 

Tacos 2 for 1My ship stranded on a rock
Colonised by sticky beings
With unsound perception
I stood and stared into the rat's eye
Malingering gleam
Betraying the organ 'Kundabuffer'
I severed the tail
And ingested the poisonous tentacle
It tasted not of home
I dined on my loved ones
My smell was not my own(Eklundh)

Hurry! Hurry!
I know you can do it

Faster! Faster!
Never mind that bleeding from your nose

Always under pressure

Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers, 
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take! 
How many memories of what radiant hours 
At sight of thee and thine at once awake! 
How many scenes or what departed bliss! 
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes! 
How many visions of a maiden that is 
No more - no more upon thy verdant slopes! 
No more! alas, that magical sad sound 
Transrorming all! Thy charms shall please no more &#8211; 
Thy memory no more! Accursed ground 
Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore, 
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante! 
"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!"CARNIVOROUS WORMS COLONY

(music by Vadim Nikolaev; lyrics by Alex Pishikin)

infected organism
 can't manage with the parasites
 they are propagating themselves
 multiplying rapidly

eaten from inside

consuming you body
 the're swarming in
 the abdominal cavity
 you feel them crawling in

eaten from inside

worms are devouring the living flesh
 killing so slowly and cruelly
 the pain is driving you mad
 profuse bloody discharge

carnivorous worms colony
 inside you eaten away body
 they're propagating themselves
 multiplying rapidly

eaten from insideI wandered obscure chasms; I sought a vacant glyph: a sign, a Portent in the dwelling-place of the underworld. When you pulled my fingers back and my limbs gave way, gave way...(Instrumental)Never stop at appearances - There is always something to discover and understand. - Everywhere - Irony, lies, truth - you choose where to STOP.(Instrumental)Listen to my sword i hold high
Praying to my gods
Listen to the words of our gods
And fighting for them

The pagan knights will fight
Fight for freedom

Without any fear we march into the battle
Blood will cover the path, the path to freedom

With proudly raised heads and crossed swords
We are ready to fight and to die

We protect our country and our faith
The faith in the old gods

The pagan knights will fight
Fight for freedom

With proudly raised heads and crossed swords
We are ready to fight and to die

We are odins warriors, prepare to die for him
With proudly raised heads and crossed swords

The one eyed old man is our king
The king of wisdom and freedom
If you're invited to his great halls
You are free, you're always freeFrom the beginning of time some have tried to enslave mankind.
Religious zealots, political puppets, the ruling elite behind the scenes stage attacks to gain approval in order to pass fascist policies.
You are are a slave to the media, slave to currency, slave to greedy bastards, slave for eternity!
You are under the control of the New World Order.
Don't take everything for face value.
There is more there than you can see.
They rule out of fucking greed.
They are here to rule your fucking life.a vanity rises in the middle of our motion
with ever-changing colours of illusive existential components
unfictitious presence, scars and withdrawal, leaving us to wonder...
i want to see, but my eyes are blind
should i seek for a guidance of my life?
beyond a flock of confusion
i ask for a return to original form
without any agreement or concensus
determination has already been chosen
free us from a process of decadence
free us from a procession to our graves
back to the state where things just started
back to the place where i belong
i want to see, but my eyes are blind
should i seek for a guidance of my life?Dip in boiling oil
Rack and guillotine
Squeezing on purulent boils
Penance for your sins
All methods mentioned
Are lovely toys
Now I'm going to tell you
How I fill my joys
The saw is my favourite instrument
That will provide your slow end
Into a sort of huge screaming pupper
Writhing in rivulates of blood
Raw and slimy, shapeless flesh
Mixed up with splinters, of bones smashed
Blood and guts lying on the floor
Soon you will see tons of gore
Pregnant women used for the saw
So make sure you will never break the law
Stripped and tied, head down
Soon you will lie, lifeless on the ground
Spread eagled, I start to saw
"La sierra" is notched and raw
Upside down position, adequate blood
Oxygen, reached the brain
Preventing you from bleeding to death
Keeps you from losing consciousnessPlain clothes 
Duck decoys 
Continue steady 
Observation 
Rapt in the expansion 
Of an impregnable circle 

Imminent circle 

Canceled eyes scan 
For like minded divorce 
A dance with the damned with carpal tunnel syndrome 
My binary self-portrait operates like a traffic jam 
With obsessive resolution...pressing on. 

Damned. 
Step up foresighted blindness to a Panopticism 
Player piano spits out Pollyana noise 
Rehearsing for the death...of Gilgamesh. 

Growing out of patterns of ruin and grey into a knot that resolves itself 
But lifeless to your touch, I am content to distribute torque.Tonight we're summoned for a divine cause
Remembrance - No
But for their future loss

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar...

Bedouins and nomads
Carried through the times
Through pestilences and famines
These ancient scrolls of rhymes

"Our fallen angel vexed
Was banished from the sky
Recite now from the text
Pray for all to die"

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar bed
On this night of ritual
Invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard

"Our father
Who art in hell
Unhallowed be thy name
Cursed be the sons and daughters
Of thine Nemesis
Whom are to blame
Thy kingdom come
nemA"

Tonight we summoned for His unholy fiend
Now celebrate
The End

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar bed
On this night of ritual
Invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastardwords meant to express
assumptions without the facts
blood boils, anger flares
vitriol i spit forth

freedom, my hatred expressed no alternatives
there shall be no redemption

hell hath no fury than an ocean scorned
maggots, a stab in the back
a dirty cunt to bring me down
who made you god? your shit does stink

wake up to yourself or perhaps you need
a violent lesson or perhaps karma
the anger i feel cannot be described
i want to see you dead

eternal extroversion receives persecution
confrontational delusion

strike me down with your blindess
suffer the blows of my resurrectionThere is something in your eyes
That make them back in fear
There is something in your scent
That make them run away
They know that you're strong
They know that they're weak
They want you dead, but never dear
They lost within their fear

Sign of Kain!
Not for the weak
Sign of Kain!
Make them fear
Sign of Kain!

Why should you live in fear?
Why should you suffer?
Why you can't just kill
Same way he did
But you prefer instead
Lie to yourself

By right of the strongest
He always takes what he wants
Who tried to protest
Strongest always right!
Kain you are right!

Not afraid to kill
Not afraid to die
Nothing to hide
Everything to lose
Our sight is your sign
You wasn't cursed Kain
Man of spirit is awarded
While weak are laying deadThe heated sky upon my head
Shows me nothing but true hate.
The fog is blurring me your sad and cruel truth.

The night is born, the day is dead
to realize it's now too late
I own your doom and it will last forever

I feel my grandeur above the rest
no one plays on my decisions
the weaker we get, the stronger you are
The power of my impunity
Turns my sins into ambitions
the order won't heal, makes our infection grow up

I am the truth, the only truth
you do what I want you to do
How easy is to lead with all this power
the wind of hopes, the wind of lies
it swept away all you could trust
Now get down on your knees or die in silence[Lyrics: - Macey]

The fire in the sky He who gives us light The sun - our lord Giver of all life His coming has been the herald The dawn of a new cycle For as long as it has been remembered It has been this way

He is life eternal The focus of our worship We dared not look upon him Until this fateful day

[Solo: - Macey]

His flames diminish! Shadows begin to fall At the apex of his journey This cannot be so! In terror i look into his heavens I need not shield my eyes Dust rising from afar Is swallowing our lord 

[Solo: - Macey]
[Solo: - Macey]

The ground trembles In the distance thunders roar His powers blast the lands Fierce winds whip up the sands How have we displeased him? Not in lack of dedication We cower as the skies darken Our lord is nowhere to be seen

[Solo: - White]

He did not return Deserting us in twilight Without his solar powers Our crops withered and died Terrible winter froze the sand Killing the sick old and young Our faith is all that binds us to These lands our lord has left us toListen! So listen to the news!
A next affair is here.
We have hot news, so true facts
about politicians and their parties.
With the covert support of reign and
power.
Does massmedia really work for the
public?
They twist slickly the truth and
they control the masses and quietly
manipulate the voters.

The massmedia control
The massmedia lies

One statesman attended a bizarre sex club.
A second senator smoked pot 
20 years ago, but he didn't know that
it was grass?

Vote, vote, vote!
Vote for the shit, vote for the liars,
only they are the best.

We are an independent journal,
we are the true tv, we are here for you.
We also have the pictures from a holiday
where also the president have been together
with a prostitute. They work for political
parties and they accept millions from them
for guaranteed news and lies.(Spoken Words)

Bleed dig (x4)
I will the channel wound 
Consecrate your tomb
Bleed dig (x4)
I will the channel wound 
You've drained down to your tomb

You're cut off and left behind
The product of a weaker mind
Self evident, flayed and spliced
Way down and locked inside

You trust me, 
I lie
I cross you, 
You die
I dig deep... 
All night
Claws and teeth
I'm blind

Excavate
Eradication
Excavate
Eradication

I will the channel wound 
Your hopes drained dry, entombed

Dig deep(Instrumental)Some kind of desire is growing in me,
I need to release my soul,
To awake from my sleep
No, I can't wait no more. It's time to go!
So many things to see... So many things to do...
Now I see, I see the way,
Please don't stop me now, and say...

There's a fire that burns inside,
I don't wanna miss this light,
There's a passion that fills my heart,
Emptiness is gone away...

I didn't want to hurt you,
I don't want you think I'm bad,
Please don't you hate me,
I know you'll carry on
Now I see, I see the way,
I know you'll understand

There's a fire that burns inside,
I don't wanna miss this light,
There's a passion that fills my heart,
Emptiness is gone away...

There's a fire that burns inside,
I don't wanna miss this light,
There's a passion that fills my heart,
Emptiness is gone away...Climb, rise up to the bottom
Where every inch is several miles
Higher, yes higher it's not the last of it
The bridge of ignorance has been reduced to ashes
So seek and you'll find
Everything you've ever cherished
You chose to leave behind...
On the wall

Climb alone, your insecurities shown
Your weaknesses exposed
When you arrived you've accomplished nothing
And feel empty inside
So you sit and you wait
And you remain stagnant
As the hours turn to days

Or you'll fall to the side and hide
Watch them as they all pass you by
You must decide it's time
Do you join them or continue to climb

And possibly stay alive

Rise up to the bottom, before I let you down
Be not afraid, I go before you always
No, not this time
Together we shall both be
DerailedBitterness awakens
From its sleep in the heart of man
Cold shivers incest the young ones...
In our greatness we fall damned
Hatred imbeded
Deep within our putrid souls
Bloody hands still remain clad
With the torture of humanity
We live in a world of
Individual lust
No one can save us
From ourselves
Human nature...Or maybe animal instinct
Here
upon,
The screams turned cries remain
It makes a slave of me
Slowing down my personal thoughts
Escape the fallacy
Of cleanliness unbound
Slit my wrists...Free me from the pain of life
Let blood flow
Down my arm and from my soul
Seal my fate...To torture for a thousand years
Kill yourselves...No one cares about your tears...
Happily married am I
To the soft home whence I came
But the torment of your find
Interrupts my eternal dream of life...
Neverending agony
Fulfills your precious cause
My eyes are bloodshot red
From pondering killed innocence
We will never free ourselves, we're
Bound to pathetic lies
To continue-to exist like this
Is living suicide
Now is the time to admit our fault
The dark embrace is yet to squeeze
The purity of this ugly clan
You are a horrid sight to see
The perfect likeness
Of oppression and guilt
Morality Does Not Exist
Except Within Your Minds
Reality Is An Opiate Plane
Created By All Mankind(Instrumental)Astral Conversions, spiritual modes
Invalid termination of a tyrant yoke
Parasites of innocence, the accident of god,
the plague of suffering reminds the coming of the fall...

Depraved emotions, a sanctum place.
Zodiac circle, the signs of Hell.
The law of heritage on a chimera based,
labyrinth of genesis division's parade.

Electric perversion for a human being
perpetual motion like an infinite sin.
A schism of holiness, the science of will,
crossing the universe with nails and dreams

Religious archetype, the parody of a mass
the void solution like a God with mask
Artificial silence, a never ending faith 
the roots of abhorrence command the instinct of hate...

Insulting the virtues of a sun with an endless light
Between... between the ruins of the mind
Defecting to the esoteric isolation like an eye
You are incited to betray...

Possessed by visions, an ultrasonic end
Chemical systems... of the broken DNA
a soul with chains
the egg of knowledge

Depraved the spirit of those who keep the flames
Behold the eruption of the cosmic seer

A vortex of renewal - A whirlpool of soulsA worthless island in the lake of cold, the wholeness
broken by the power of higher laws. If unable to grow, a
one is sentenced into depths, into endless dark night
when the other self must awake

All I see and seem is but a dream within streams of creation
- sediments of falsities growing upon the well of illusion.
The shapeless eternity reflects in a soul (the seed of
essence) and yet the ramifying spring of artificial being
perceive what once was before the alpha, the genesis and
the aeon per se.

The essence trapped in a body remains blind to
manifestations of great cycles and deaf to a voice of
numinous. Struck mute by the horror of the great other,
unfeeling of the vibrations divine, Murder your senses
and read from the books that have never been written,
seen and tainted. Accept fruits from the tree of ideas
forbidden to the sane that grows in the aphotic
nether world nourished by despair of all that has ever
lived and will live.

Is the awareness of one`s my world's so cruel

Hell, Is where I lie
Now take the power, When we all die

We all dieOne chance, one life, do you beg to exist?

I've been thrust into disarray
My mind's in ruin and my body's in decay
Take control of your life, stop running..
Take control of your life.....stop running.....
stop running......

Burning from the inside, rotting my brain
numbing from the outside, rotting away....
away.....all of our wonders, fortified strongholds 
steles, and pillars, and temples of the earth -
everything will crumble; all empires fall; 
every gene, every cell, every synapse
every last helix of the human DNA 
will surely be cleansed with death -
kingdom after kingdom after kingdom perish;
martyrs of gluttony, apostate emperors, usurpers of the ruby crown
will quiver in the quagmires of the sludgy vagina
out of which we have crawled as a family
with the filth of birth as our only common denominator,
but with every fucking choice we make
and every fucking thought we think 
as the differentiator that rips open an abyss between us 
that separates us; isolates us
in the complete solicitude and loneliness 
of existence, the horror, the curse of life,
the massive conspiracy against all that breathed 
and will ever breathe;
so, choose your death! for it is all that we do...
choose your death, destroy yourself; 
can you really do anything else?
no excuses
no solace
no fucking circumstances
just the harrowing angst
of responsibility. 
hypnotized 
ad nauseam
by the pendulum of doubt 
that oscillates between nothing and something
we are 'til death, 
and sunburnt to crisps of cancer
proliferating existential melanoma
under the raving nihil sun
we feel sick; weak; shivering, 
and we perspire cold sweat;
and we throw up from the whiffs 
of the effluvia of fear and trembling
belched from the pharynx of life 
we have felt 
increasing
like lyme disease
since our inception
now, many years ago;
we throw our nets from towed boats
and watch them sink deep in oceans of questions 
and we carve ourselves a totem in situ 
out of the megalith of an existence accursed; 
however, life is merely the parable of truth, 
and many plankton escape the fishers' net;
many meshes are sawn asunder
by the ferocious teeth of viperfish,
and to this day, no one knows what really is down there,
we just know there is something,
deep
deep
in the deep sea graves of life, life, 
life - 
the horrible disease, the bitter prognosis...
...what the fuck will happen when all spiritual antibiotics fail, 
and the sickness will carress our embarrassed shoulders 
in tasteless mockery?
welcome it, or walk forever in circles:
the complete dissolution 
of the human emotional-intellectual immune system;
reason, logic, laws - fuck off - 
the cunt devours mercilessly-
 so, choose your death! for it is all that we do...
choose your death, destroy yourself; 
can you really do anything else?
no excuses
no solace
no fucking circumstances
just the harrowing angst
of responsibility.The sewer's a place where a Ghoul can relax,
Comforts abound that the surface just lacks
Bubbling toxins that ooze from old pipes,
Barrels of goo; discarded wipes
Crumbling corridors covered with slime,
Rivers of sewage and trickling brine
These caverns are harboring something undead,
Some wretched creation is rearing it's head

Hatched from a maggot, he is quite bizarre,
He smells like a cess pool but he shreds on guitar

He crawled into the catacombs one day
I swear we could smell him a mile away
He grabbed a guitar and proceeded to kill
He blew us away with his mosh riffing skill

We welcomed him into our ranks
The hood he proudly wore
We eagerly present this fiend
Ladies and germs, it's Dissector!

I came to shred faces
And shred them I will
With archaic chords
That possess you to kill

Up from the sewer and into the pit
We three now are four and we're taking no shit
The villagers won't know what hit them tonight
We'll show them the meaning of horror and fright
Dissector's axe will cleave them in twain
I will dismember and harvest their brains
Fermentor will brew up some rot gut to choke
Cremator will burn all their corpses to coke

YOUR BLOOD FOR HIS GLORY(Instrumental)Smoke and fire are burning bright, we'll set the tinderbox alight.

Rising from the ashes the phoenix lives, life and death the red flame gives.

Give me fire, on which I feed, give me fire, 'cus it's a need.
Real fine, I can tell, real fine really burns in hell.

Take a breath the heat surmounts, your mind wanders, you have your doubts.

Brain goes numb, in the heat, body glows, you cling to your seat.

It's on my head if I burn, sit next to me and take your turn.
Don't blame the flame by which I'm fuelled, one day by fire we'll all be ruled.Frequent atrocities, a habit of onslaught
Feasting upon limbs, of a non-Caucasian sort
An immodest being, unleashing his needs
Devoured by excitement, that comes with the deeds

This ivory with an ill disposed mind
Mutilates voraciously from the ebony kind

Inside 213
The horror breeds
Inside 231
Of the dead he feeds

While malign grabs his heart, and illness infects his mind
He takes away their pride, and coerce them to the other side
Collections of maimed parts, placed around in random
Repugnant sights distinguishes his repulsive acts

Bashed his first victim, at the age of eighteen
Several years after he made his frenzy killing spree

Inside 213
The horror breeds
Inside 231
Of the dead he feedsIf you were to sever my arm I would grow one more
As I regenerate I'll still have another four
It would not be the first time autonomy has saved me
If you were to sever my legs I would grow two more
As I regenerate I'll still crawl on the floor
These pieces please feel free to keep all for yourself
They'll eat and breathe and grow into unsightly things
Haunting you with their resemblance of me
Though lacking any sort of heart I figure they'll fare better in your company
They're all yours now

He waits for the sunrise, but I know he won't see
He forgot is was hopeless with the tubes in his veins
I could feel the same!

I fear the pain in my brain
And I don't know how it will end

My life will change into a darker place
But I don't care I'll beat i when it hurts

I know where I'm going this way isn't new to me
But will I get a strange mind
Will I still remember my name?Split and burning,
Coiling in mouths,
Like snakes,
Ready to attack.
Soul, captured.
Fever tongues, adored.

Syllables formed to holy curses, emerging from throats, spawning profane death.

Soul, captured.
Fever tongues preach.
Split and burning,
Coiling in mouths,
Next to rotting teeth,
Vibrate tongues
That never sleep.Magic Nights

Exhausted and near death,
Tyrael percieves a light in the dark.
A few steps in front of a little house
he drowns in deep unconsciousness.
Dagaz, a nice young demigoddess,
owner of this house,
picks him up and cares for him
until he arouses.

[Ref.1]
Whenb he looked into her eyes
both fell in deep love,
it's clear! They'll spend some magic nights.
And hope they'll stay together so long.

Attracted by her smile,
Tyrael knows that he found the one,
the one to stay near by,
the one to live with side by side.
Dagaz is now sad and worried,
she knows that she'll get a child,
but it's not the baby, it's not Tyrael
it's the premonition of war that makes her wild.

[Ref.2]
When they looked into their eyes
both fell in deep love.
Now as they spent some magic nights

When we embarked on our journey
Yet the flaws born so far away
Still continue to lead
The blissful man by the hand
Stranded vessels upon her waters
Feet wet with quicksand
Relentlessly wasting their seed

As we take off from the surface
And behold the sunken blooms
Their fate shall further guide us
And nearly divide one division in two
From the initial radiant seven
United by their work (to become one)
Exceeding perfection to eleven
To love nothing but that which is true

Tapping into currents of destruction
Has lost all of its significance
Buried under the anvil of reason
The almighty omnipotence (of nothingness)
As the roots reach the sky from my casket
They impale my illusory skin
From our Chaldean dungeons and crosses
Blindness is our treasure to winYou can find it on the street
Can read it from the face
It''s waiting for you
In the gutter
How long must we wait for it?All time, being,

Identities shaped
and persisted

Spawned past death

Cosmic holocaust
and transmutation

Before it could
be finished,

Persoanality's test is freeIn spring I did not sleep for forty nights
Nor did I change my underwear
And the grass-stalks along my arduous path
Sang that it was good
For they witnessed my fasting
Surviving on spiritual beer
I became Christs; a whole bunch of them
We flogged each other
In our ferocious dance
Spinning like dogs behind our tails
And none of us changed his underwear(Eklundh)

The bitter season's here
The lies, the pain, the fear
And you'll see inside of me
You've never seen before 

The bitter season's here
Won't shed a single tear
Wish you would turn around
And walk right out that door 

My face is whipped by rain
The wind eases the pain
But when the silence comes I pray that you'll be gone 

The bitter season's here
This time I see it clear
But it took me years and years
To see what was going on

Look into my eyes...

Give me the days we had
And make 'em last forever
And I will cry for you
If you will cry for me 

I've met eternity
Brother insanity 

It was too late for us
A long, long time ago 

The bitter season's here
The lies, the pain, the fear
Got to be movin'
But where I just don't know

He lives all alone
Unable to find his way out
Scared by the thought 
Of forgetting his land
Will he ever go back home again

Always counting days that never end

He's cast away
Now he has to fight for his own life
He's far away
In a  lonely place
But he'll survive       

Learnt to live
Just by looking at things
Nature is his friend and enemy
Building a new ship
To find his way back
Dreaming of sailing on the blue sea

Deadly encounters
Bad surprises
Storms destroy his best devices

Stronger than steel
He's determined to live
He's tough enough to not go insane
Reading the Bible
To strengthen his faith
His skills will lead him to victory

Pain and darkness will not win this time(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Millions of people kneeling down 
Before our fluffy friend in disguise 
Blindly obeying a newfound leader 
With a skillful mouth full of lies 

So why are you following it? 
Financing all the crimes 
Another twisted religion 
In a group of thousand of its kind 

This is my personal 
Grievance for the gods 
Treating us like ragdolls 
A grandscheme puppet show 

So it's wrong to have an opinion 
Oh sure the evolution was a lie 
I get it, it's easier for the masses 
There goes another million with blank minds 

This is madness 
In the line next are 
The infidels 
Losing their lives 

It's useless 
Like dolphins 
Converting to christianity 
With no reason why 

This is my personal 
Grievance for the gods 
Treating us like ragdolls 
A grandscheme puppet show 

The end starts now(Instrumental)Tied to a iron "bed"
Feet and legs were greased
And then a brasier
Was placed underneath
Decompose the melting flesh
Repulsive stench
Of hot roasting flesh
Flesh is roasted, bones are showed
Limbs are lacerated, bodies are desecrated
The fire would cause burns if you are guilty
But leave you unharmed if you are innocent
Innocence presupposed
Withstand any trialthere was a time when I felt strange
I felt like losing my mind
driven by thoughts and memories
lost into the depths of my life

cannot return into the past
and to the one I was before
stranded insane and paled with fear
I saw my life has turned to waste
now that my time has come
please bear me up tonight!

things will never be the same
life will go on this way
it takes time to get to know
the way things go on this way
I will never be the same
after drowning this way

there was a place where I felt safe
with both of my feet on the ground
remember the lazy moments
a warm and easy summer afternoon
now that these days have gone
please save me from the night

things will never be the same
life will go on this way
when I shout against the sky
i hear no one answer
I will never be the same
After drowning this way

Things will never be the same
The tide is rising in my brain
Sink into the waves of time - save my soul!Day-light cuts and tears my form
With golden whip of ancient curse
Accursed famine's endless course
A lust for crimson flowing life

In raging waves of Wolvish lvst
Within the grip of poisoned blood
To drink the ink of dying light
The torture of an endless life

In dusty silence listen and behold
Breathe and choke in final solitude
Stand as one in blasphemy -
Light of a thousand dying stars

AND TO BREAK ANOTHER LINK
FROM OFF THOSE CHAINSYou know exactly where it's been 
Why would you put it in your mouth? 
You let it marinate for days 
Then you expect to suffer less? 

You didn't just throw a rock at the hive, 
you forced your tongue inside. 
How could you expect anything less than the worst? 

Now no one will hear your cries, 
because they choose not to. 
You've played these cards before. 
Now, you're alone in a boat with the rest of the world. 
But I think you'll make it, 
no one yet died from a cold.(Instrumental)Ascend, faceless
Naked, I am yours

See me naked, I'm dying
I needed you, my face is _f..._

Ice Nerveshatter, dead and dreaming
Bow to me. Bow to me.

I am defeated, I gotta walk away
I won't walk away. Let me see.

And I needed this you watch me
I'll bleed to death, watch me

Do you feel it?
When you're gone you're gone
Do you feel it?
Why did you leave?

Feel it.
Feel it.Do you want to see another side of me 
A side of me that you have never seen 
You can only push me so far and you soon will see 
When I become your sinister, your sinister fiend 

I do not recall me ever asking what you think 
Your opinion matter more to you 
I have seen the brink and I am not about to sink 
Into that hell you wanna put me through 
I decide if I will hide, Or face your evil deeds 
And I will draw the line That crosses you and me

I've got a thing or two for you 
For all the hell that you have put me through 
I'll deal a blow to leave you high and dry 
A fistful of regret straight for your eye 
So now I see, and you're gonna see 
The end of the line 
It's the end of the line 

I've got a thing or two for you 
For all the hell that you have put me through 
I'll deal a blow to leave you high and dry 
A fistful of regret straight for your eyeOPEN. THE SHADOWS ARE OPEN.
AND THEY WILL HOUND YOU
AND TEAR YOU DOWN.
FOOL! YOU SAW THE COMING WINTER
FROM MILES AWAY.
YET YOU DID NOTHING.

(RAVAGING WIND.)

STAY IN HERE. THE NIGHTS ARE LONG -
THIS WILL BE THE DARKEST ONE.
COVER UP YOUR BRIGHT EYES.
SEE NOTHING MORE.

COME DOWN TO THE GARDEN.
THIS IS THE FUNERAL FEAST.
STRANGER, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
YOU BROUGHT THE PLAGUE.

REVEL NOW IN THE MURDERING HOUR.
ENTER. WE, TO THE CONDEMNING FIRE.
BEWARE YOU THE BURGEONING SEED.
BLOOD FEEDING ITS NEW ROOTS.

SHADOW. LIKE A CANCER.
GROWING UNCHECKED HERE.
FOOL! YOU WANTED THE WINTER.
WELL, HERE IS THE WINTER.

COVER YOU IN SOFT WHITE CLAY.
OVER WHERE OUR BODIES LAY.
YOU AND WE ARE ONE.
SO, YOU WERE THE LAUGHING ONE.
LIKE A FLAME TO SHAME THE SUN.
LIKE A FLAME, YOU FELL DOWN.
AND BECAME ASH.I cannot carry on, 
Drifting beneath the canopies, 
I pass a rotting song bird, 
A sign as the sun sets for the last time, 
In search of a home for my bones, 
I've torn myself apart, 
Over something I can't fix, 
I reminisce over past days gone by, 
Shedding a teardrop for blood, 
Thriving off my own decay, 

When I'm forgotten, 
You'll be given the comfort you needed, 
A warm place to stay, 
As my days remain grey, 
Though before I'm gone, 
I mark these words in stone, 
Engraved with one thousand razor blades, 
In scathing blood, my body swayed.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Wanting, Nothing Asking Nothing
Bleak is her absolution from god
And she holds him tight like vines
Clutching and climbing a pillar to heaven

Nothing seen and nothing heard
The weakness displayed by abandon
Abandon the mind and the body
Let the wolves in and kneel in hope
All is great and good

To those whom speak and the name of god
in broken passages and burning arches
Let your end be slow and pitiful so you know
He is not with you and you are alone

Swear off the wonderment of neutrality
Wrap your eyes in the cloth of theism
For we are the children of the god and yes
We are here to hold sway over all life
Let all who disbelieve lay in waste

One true god one true path
Follow suit fellow humans or suffer his wrath
Lest ya suffer the fire of hell here on earth
Or be bound and sent to the deep blue sea
One god, one path

Her eyes are sewn shut
Blindly she follows the whims of her god patiently
Until her will is submerged and she learns to serve
As your god taught and blinded you with crosses
To me it simply appears discourteous to wear the symbol
Of a deity long dead...

Can you look around this world and  believe
In the goodness of a god who rules it.
Famine, Pestilence, Squalor, Disease and Death
They rule this world.
There is little hope I assure you.
If a god of love and light ever did exist he is long since dead
And someone... something, rules in his place...DystopiaExposing skin to hidden solar bites
Radiate me with your midnight sun
The beauty of insomnia starts to hypnotize,
clinging to my disrhythmical sense of hope.

No permanent cycle for us, the unseen
In quest to find a glimpse of tomorrow
Foreseen nothing less of an exact rotating order
reaching out from within, a constant state of change.

Believing in a nearest doorway
to find real sunlight as I awaken
Having a goodnight when the sun comes out
Dawn or dusk, it does not matter anymore.

Feeling somewhat lacking, thinking somewhat deceiving
Confusion is here and now in my collateral windows.The painful discrepancy 
Between the ideal and the real. 
The melancholic nostalgia of Brahms. 
A wind upon the open fields 
Like a burnt offering. 
The banished one listens 
In his night-dark lair 
To the songs of the ancient ones. 
An old, old fable haunts me, 
And will not let me rest.The lyrics to "Der Michelin" were
confiscated during French class
by Mr. Lurgens when he caught Graph
Head writing them on the inside back
cover of his French workbook. Therefore,
we are unable to reprint them here.
Those who wish to protest can try writing
to Mr. Lurgens, c/o Coalinga High School.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The ultimate desperationInside emptyness
Subhuman isolation
On edge of society
Troubled existence and total indolence
of all these hungry homeless
With no justice with no food
Searching something for the point of living.
We are at the end of second millenium
and we are being fucking of pressed
Hunger, dirt, infections, rats.
Crying, death, insanity, stench.
This is a scorn so where have
all the equal rights gone?
Everybody is watching it
without any conscience or remorse.
Is there anybody who gives a fuck about
the tremendous desperation
and sorrow of this people?Denial, no function, loveless, no meaning
Fearless, system, suffering on, existence 

Meaning, distorting , shapeless, feeling
Fearless, system, suffering on, existence 

Why am I, such a void
[repeat]Music and lyrics: Gustavo Sierra H

I'm gonna fight AGAINT NATURE...
I will show you now (why) I'm RIGHT 
I Don't care about your stories so just

Disturbance in the acts
Around the world
Neo bastards screaming
For another time
Hate and fear
Belongs to our
What to do

Nightmare
Into myself
Don't ending
While I live

Disturbance is fact
For worldwide
There's nothing to say
There's nothing to do
Only hateNot enough from year to year
People still live in fear
Raging battle in the streets
Violence rules in here
Every brave new day
Victims go away
Kill each other for ideal
For hatred and for fears
For constant beeing in weed
Over worlds drawning deep
Confusion overloads
You anger grows
Stand up just say no
Thing and get it under control
Never surrender
Just say noIn the east a storm is rising
One dark horse appears on the horizon
Sowing seeds of chaos and confusion
Time to buy weapons and learn how to use them

Genghis Khan, Napoleon and Nero
History decides - villain or a hero
Who's your king? The leader or the liar
Take the oath and meet the new messiah

One dark horse with no rider in the saddle
Will soon come forth to lead us into battle
An ancient bloodstained flag unfurls
As we wage our war on a dying world

False prophets - cheaper by the dozen
Fools all, name a one who wasn't
Slaves of God - witness the millenium
One dark horse will come forth to free them

Bow down to the true messiah
Receive the mark for all that you desire
Deny Christ - lunatic and liar
One dark horse rises from the fire

One dark horse rides toward destiny
Everything i've done finally comes back to me
Paid in full for all that i've sacrificed
Black knights in the service of the antichrist

A new age is dawning
A new breed is spawning
Last generation - final confrontation
This war will be won
A new kingdom comeXenu, confederation's lord, free me
Lord, might lord, take my hand
God, evil god, blame my soul
writer, sci-fi writer, tell this story

hatred, space, star, DC9
tax, planets, aliens freezing bodies
flames, volcano, fire, eliminate enemies
minds, religion, god , body theitanNeurophenomenological cave 
A cell without doors or windows 
The silence of infinitely open spaces 
The abyss of human illusion 
Blind unorganism in darkness 
An island of pain in an ocean of indifference 
A worm crawling upon the cosmic carrion 
Confronting two mirrors 
A boundless black veil 
Swallowing all dimensions 
Pain and awareness neurologically fused 
Sever the living branch lest it puncture the void 
Destroy the present tense of memorySeems to me was yesterday
Two young hearts under this rain
So don't call me, and don't think
I'll follow
Better you'll come back to him,
Your sorrow.

It's the end of your world
Stay away from my cold
It's the end of the fairytales
We belong to planet Earth

We believe in trouble and sins,
We are wrong in everything,
I don't change my point of view,
It's law for me!

Better walking on the fire than slavery,
It's the end of your world
Stay away from my cold
It's the end of the fairytales
We belong to planet Earth

It's the end of your world
Stay away from my cold
It's the end of the fairytales
We belong to planet Earth
It's the end of your world
Stay away from my cold
It's the end of the fairytales
We belong to planet EarthI wake to the dead night where the shadows rule
A thousands bats flying above me as if to welcome
A new blood brother
Far away from life, my soulless shell is glad to be here
My veins are drained but still alive
I scream to the sky begging to see the light, again
But light seems to be far away from reality
I remember the life I left behind

My fate an eternal journey and this the beginning far away
From life, my soulless shell is glad to be here
Far away from life, my soulless shell is glad be be here
My veins drained but still alive

I scream to the sky begging to see the light again
But light seems to be far away from reality
Reality, far away from reality
I remember the life I left behind my fate and eternal
Journey and this the beginning far away from life my
Soulless shell is glad to be here, glad to be here
My veins are drained...
My life, an eternal journey and this the beginning
Far away from life I scream...
Reality, far away from life my soulless shell is glad to be hereAs I behold our brave new world
I feel the anger rise
A world of hatred, greed and pain
Deceit and global lies

The blood within my veins
Seething with rage
Against the human race

I was a stranger to myself
Until I realized
Our world is nothing but a fake
Illusion for the mind

The blood within my veins
Seething with rage
Against the human race

Existing without living - dead for life
Selfextinct - mindbending suicide

Realize all the lies you've been tied to
dehumanized in this souldevouring gloom

This is the time to learn and wise
Up to a greater I
To rise against the ones who keep
The left-brain-prison tight

The blood within my veins
Seething with rage
Against the human raceWith eyes to the sky, I walk into the ocean
The calm surrounds me...
My spirit bends to the pattern of gravitone winds
My heart plunges forth into the silver waters
The creatures are closing in
I am foreign
I do not know this place
This is folly
The coral hands place a liquid crown upon my head
The stillness has found me
My passing has come
I stare into the eyes of the deep
nothing stirs
A thought burdens my mind...
Can I exist here? 
"Can I exist here?" 
My words echo from a voice that sways above
It speaks an ancient tongue of the deep...
I in hale
Air fills my lungs
"Welcome," says the voice. "You are home."
My mind spirals out of thought
Am I home now?
The voice is silent.
The creatures circle around me
My feet touch the ocean floor
The kingdom under the worldAs i gaze into the sky
I can see the ravens fly
And as i hear the northern call
In battle is where i will fall
When axes clash and blood is shed
My path is paved by the dead
In battle i will reign supreme
On victory i am so keen

As i gaze into the sky
I can see the ravens fly
And as i hear the northern call
In battle is where i will fall

In battle we will stand or fall
Waiting for the northern call
To asgard we're gonna fly
Ravenlike we'll soar to the sky

In battle
I will reign supreme
In battle
We will stand or fall
In battle

In battle we will stand or fall
Waiting for the northern call
To asgard we're gonna fly
Ravenlike we'll soar to the skyMy inner sanity is slipping through the chains
Answers of the night are shadowing my mind
When do I have to follow, the tension thrills my guide
Now the spirit leads my sight to a land without a light

Enter nowhereland, enter nowhereland

This time I need to know, each time I've wondered
When they told me about the lonely man
Sitting in his wonderland
Could it be the man in the streets just begging for a smile?
Why do I have to be afraid when even angels die?

Enter nowhereland, enter no-mans-land

Hope is my devotion, trust is my belief
So the stories for the child still living in my mind
Could it be a land without light, a silent misery
A kingdom of infinity, this time I need to know

Enter nowhereland, enter no-mans-landI saw into the grave
grave
the day I first struck light
felt woe as time grew
clear
in the belfry
of my unmade brain
sucked
gall from the flooded tit
of a hanging cancer matron moon
grew
bitter in my flesh
as I grew hoarse in my throat
crying
vengeance in my mother-hold
drowning in tides of foam
across the fevered flowers of coming age
Struck dumb the mouthing
kisses
of my elders bending low
in love at cradle height
tore the napkin from my crotch
placed a jock-strap
deep
in my challenged male
cursed God his choice
blasted
the blessed in his will(Instrumental)Mankind's kept under control
(By living) within a constant state of fear
A raging war for our souls
Spiritual warfare to sear
The truth within ourselves
A truth for millennia concealed
To keep us all asleep
Believing means to be deceived
By the wolves among us sheep

Reconquering the soul
Your lies losing control
Our lives in our own hands again
Your reign shall finally come to an end

A secret that has been untold
Yet it is hidden in plain sight
As tyranny unfolds
While the masses stay deaf and blind
To the real powers that we all hold (inside)
Inside the mind's I
Occupation of the throne

Reconquering the soul
Your lies losing control
Our lives in our own hands again
Your reign shall finally come to an end

Knowing subconscious - all secrets revealed
Genetic wisdom - thrive cosmic seed

Reconquering the soul
Your lies losing control
Our lives in our own hands again
Your reign shall finally come to an end

We've been supposed to be slaves
From the cradle to the grave
Tied to invisible chains
Gods and ideals make our days
Through all the pain we've to take
In this (eternal) spiral of self-betrayal
freedom fell from grace

...reconquering the soul...I have come 
With weight on my tongue 
To Speak 
The Devil's words 
And To 
Set fire to your heart 
Only Satan is real 
Our Dark master 
Of this world 
Behold the great serpent 
Behold the kingdom of Hell 
For the glory of Satan 
I have com to speak 
The Devil's words 
Only Satan is real 
Our Dark master 
Of this world 
Rise from the gallows 
Rise up to the Earth 
Set fire to the sky 
And watch it bleed a thousand times 
And rise 
For the glory of SatanIt was just another sunny day on June, when men of pride and dignity arrived,
they spoke of us in a different tongue, they claimed earth as their kingdom,
and the truth as its defense. They said they knew what was our best and what we better
follow their path so eager to reveal the womb of paradise.
Threatening with fires that have served so well.
But no northmen seem to fear the flames of hell.

Faith hardly find its way, for the crucified one finds hard to obey, but like a common
thief stabs in the back the christians moan until lies become true

Raven eyes, will you witness this
Raven eyes, envoked by bloodstained cries

The times will change, right before their eyes, they will only hear the wind cry revenge
Fire in their sacred towers but no force wasted to save their pain

The mighty old man, now stares out over the sea, with his wind  teared eyes,
and a bleeding heart.
remembering so well, when fearless men conquered the waves, without
fear of death.....
The thunder roars, like never before, and lightning cracks the sky,
and in the flashes of the light, you can see our banner, and
thousands of men gathered to reconquer the land thatg is rgihtfully ours.

likesom vargen skall vi fruktas

Raven eyes, will you witness this
Raven eyes, envoked by bloodstained cries

The times will change, right before their eyes, they will only hear the wind cry..REVENGE..
Fire in their sacred towers but no force wasted to save their pain(Instrumental)Here in Slowland, we don't do much.
It seems too much being done is no good.
Here in Slowland, we slow people know where we stand.

Where's it lead, all this begging to please?
Yes, a maze of sick hearts to console.
When you go, go in a good way to a better place.
Don't be ashamed of Grace.
Go in a good way.Night a ghastly night
Daylight died long time ago
Voice ominous roar
Wakes fear inside
Stealing sleep

You can hide no more
You'll be found even in hell
He knows your thoughts
Knows your every step
Will find you

The shine of his eyes
Is burning your face as flame
Will use power
Of his claws to have you caught

King of darkness
Ruler and king of darkness

Blow
The killing blow
Of rotting soul
The very last cry

Bring shine of the day
Nightmare is fading away
Silence taste
Before nights
Comes again
Comes again
Night(Instrumental)weighted is the crown... buried in the ground
standing on the corner of franklin and bond
a girl of sixteen, her innocence is gone
weighted is the crown... lost her folks to the needle
how many years she isn't sure
little dottie don't remember
last ten years are such a blur
weighted is the crown... she grew into a woman
in these streets and alleyways
turning tricks and picking pockets
the one that god, forgot to save
hands... I can't escape hands... around my neck
stranglehold of failure
maladjusted wreck
she will leave this town... burn it to the ground
flooded by her memories
little broken frames
room in this old brothel
first thing set aflame she will leave this town...
these nights are getting longer
drag by like a chain
I'll ask god for forgiveness
I'm the one, he couldn't save
she will leave this town...
a match, a can of petrol
are all i needed for the start
a liberation of the spirits
the demons, will depart
not afraid to die
terrified to live
from this old room it grows hotter
across this hateful town
from main street to the harbor
I'll burn these people down
this town, it's got a feeling
and awful, wretched smell
the stench of that old whorehouse
this life I bid farewellHot August night.. when the hammer fell
A dark force was set in motion
To open up the gates of Hell
A rite of extermination.. a ritual of hate
A curse upon the human race
To force the hand of fate

Somewhere in the darkness
The wolves began to howl
The son of man and his warrior clan
Were the first to heed the call
Young lions.. alone with their pride
Always keep a weapon by their side
Pig-sticker, Jack the ripper
There's nowhere left to hide

There's a method to the madness
but it's always misunderstood
We can't change the world we live in
Without shedding some blood

Creeping-crawling in the Hollywood hills
Looking for a sacrifice
Rich pigs with impressive digs
Were the first to lose their lives

Morning never came.. a generation died
War declared, the Devil's children
Licked the blood off of their knives
No sanctuary, no shelter
...in a world gone Helter Skelter
The Devil's music took their souls
and now they've lost control

The music is the message
...and the message is clear
Listen closely, and you will hear

A rite of extermination, a ritual of hate
A curse upon the human race
to force the hand of fate
Somewhere in the darkness
The wolves begin to howl
Your children are writing in blood
A warning upon your wall

But nothing's gonna change the world
Short of violent revolution
We can't change the world we live in
There's no, there's no.. final solution
No final solution! No final solution!
It's coming down fast motherfuckers!
No final solution! No final solution
It's coming down fast motherfuckers!Vishnu, Fuck, Iblis, Fuck, Elohim, Fuck, Christ, Fuck, Zeus, Fuck Ishtar, Fuck, Isis, Fuck, Mithra, Fuck, Thunor, Fuck, Jehovah, Fuck Odin, fuck, Enlil, fuck, Reshep, Fuck, Allah, fuck, Indra, fuck, Buddah, fuck Typhon, fuck, Astaroth, fuck, Dagon, fuck, Ea, fuck, Ra, fuck, Donar, fuck Milcom, fuck, Teshub, fuck, Cronos, fuck, Lucifer, fuckEuphoria lifts my mind skyward
As my heart is buried
Sinking into the Earth
Into caverns that were Lost
And forgotten
In darkness lay forever

Memories of Love
Of blood and loss

Take them from me
As a burial gift
A body and it's history
Now Wind is my only kin

The cocoon of ignorance
The stab of reality

The child must grow
The moth will die

To find the LightIt came to pass 
Our dream is finally coming true 
Be careful what you wish for 
It's the beginning of sun's demise 
Demise 

Violent explosion 
Damaged our eyesight 
We're facing extinction 
Solar system's collapse 

This expedition is our only chance 
Our only hope 

The waiting is over 
And we are getting what we truly deserve 
As less we know it coming to an end 
Bringer of light sets the cosmos ablaze 

No more delusions of grandeur 
Our mission's in jeopardy

No signal(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hashish-hashin, Hashish-hashin

It is written in the soul of the desert
It is written in the signs in the stars
It is written in the sands of the hour glass
It is written

It is written in the eye of the falcon
It is written in the shade of the scorpion
It is written in the wealth of the sun
It is written

It is written that man's truth is a mirage
It is written that death is an oasis
It is written for all unbelievers
It is written(Instrumental)A mental scar
Reported mad
A mental scar
Brought to heel
And then become an icon of the herd mentality


I couldn't live your humble way
I couldn't breathe the pious air
Your waiting for a judgment day
It's an awful mind control affair


With one swift cut
Turned handicapped
A single cut 
turned handicapped
You're just another in a row
Surrender to the directive from above


I couldn't live your humble way
I couldn't breathe the pious air
Your waiting for a judgment day
It's an awful mind control affair

I couldn't live your humble way
I couldn't breathe the pious air
Your waiting for a judgment day
In a state of a poor mind control affairLight has been cast away
War ther bringer of pain
We won't survive
No more hope until we die

Sentinels control our life
We must give up  all our rights
To stop this mass genocide
We should obey to their lies
Eternal dark in the sky
The legion is going to rise
We must give up our fight
Soon we'll be closing our eyes

Worship the tower of doom
The kingdom of perpetual gloom
Bow to the tower of doom
The tallest building the world has ever knew 

Mayhem all across S-9
Missiles shining through the sky
Sounds of crashing cars at night
Faster than the speed of light
Shaking the earth from side to side

Serving the King and his knight
Make us believe in his rights
We have to pay with our lives
We are his holy sacrifice
Fire will turn into ice
The tortures will never suffice
Beaten to death and despised
Nobody will hear our cry(Instrumental)Behold the sky as it gets darker
And listen to the rumbling thunder
You are about to witness the flames
Of Heaven as it casts out its army of angels

When the sun dies and his sister rises
Darkness reigns over all
And the clouds redeem - form a circle
Allowing the rebels to fall.
When the sun dies and his sister rises
Shadows engulf the world
Fear descends and takes its righteous place
Unconscious hate starts to form shapes.

A shape of blood and clay
A specter old as life!
Moments of falling descending from the sky
Through beams of light

"Thus it was that Lucifer
The light-bearer,
The sharer of God's glory
The attendant of His Throne
By transgression became Satan
The Adversary"

Lay next to me 
Let me tell you a story
Hidden beyond the biblical myth
It is a tale of struggle and falling
Written with blood and guilt.

Walk with me and witness the majestic fall of angels
Behold the skies revealing the spiritual black light
Feel the grounds shaking at the mighty strikes
Of the fallen - Embrace the serpent's fire!

You cannot see - your eyes are drowned in blood
You cannot hear - your ears are filled with dust
You wish to scream - your lips are sewn from within
You can't escape the Moments of falling!We may not be, be at home
You know, that we got a tape on our phone
You know that you just got to wait for the tone
You know...

spiral downwards.
inwards. torn apart into multiple i's. the totality of which i used to

contracting. dissolving. freezing out. tidal gravitational forces tend to

theoretical maximum value for potential.
spatio-temporality inverted. space and time are turned inside out.Rising, take shape, from underground
Buried beneath this unholy soil
Writhing, contorted the lonesome road
Dealer of death, I have seen the core

My delusion, blind to the trust
All-consuming, cold to the touch
My confusion, numb to the truth
Retribution, retaking what's mine
Retake what's mine...

Reaching, below me, the underground
Half as my shadow, half nemesis
Offspring of that begotten road
Linger behind me, await my fall

My affliction, release my hold
My redemption, regaining my soul
Regain my soul...

(Spoken Words)Why all dies
In the end of the age
Cult of sin
Together as one... one!
Believing in blasphemy
Tearing nerves,
I feel the apogee of sensivity
Rotten truth
Ostentatious rationality
In the end of the age
I clearly see
Beauty is sold
Love for cash
Fat fingers hold the leash of morality
Get away if you cannot resist
Or open your eyes and behold this with me...

You plead me
To giive your faith
You speak the killing lie!
You cry like
A weak child
You pray for bastards gods
I say that you're blind
You are blind!

Don't think
That death
Is a decision

Look now
In my eyes
And put away your weapon!

In the depths of my dreams
I clearly see
Planet of graves... graves!
Harvest of insanity
Scorched earth
Acid rains
The sense of fatality
Formlessness... godforsaken place
Lifeless reality
In the depths of my dreams
I'll never see
Laughing kids, singing birds
World without cruelty
Understanding of what depresses me...(Instrumental)The world exists but doesn't listen. 
Reality is a cruel mistress. 
Apathy will get you nothing - 
you must beat her into submission. 
No shelter can stand forever. 
You have to learn to stand alone. 
When time and humans leave together, 
you'll have to live with just yourself. 

If you ask, you shall receive, 
or so we're told until the end. 
The end's less bitter, I believe, 
if we decide when it begins. 
If asking gets you nothing, take! 
Reason never wins alone. 
I forcefeed fists to the mouth of hate 
to make reality my own. 

1 2 3 Come on!First the roof was falling... then floor... after floor
Everything was moving... it all broke down

"What happened?... What happened to me?
What happened?... What happened to me?"

Trapped in silence... fearful and alone
It's hard to breathe... in this doomed tomb

"It is dark!... I don't know where I am!
It is dark!... I don't know where I am!"

For frantic hours I'm diggin' with my bare hands
Exhausted and scared
It feels like ages... am I still alive?
Or am I dreaming with open eyes?

Struggling for my life... for my life
In the wreckage... wreckage

Unbreakable chains - invincible force
Undetected - imprisoned below
In this dungeon death reaches me
Embedded under debris

Buried alive... soon to die... 
buried alive... soon to be dead

The most brutal experience... I have ever made
Cold sweat and blood... I need to be calm

"My heart beats... with a magnitude of ten! 
My heart beats... with a magnitude of ten!" 

For frantic hours I'm diggin' with my bare hands
Exhausted and scared
It feels like ages... am I still alive?
Or am I dreaming with open eyes?
 
Struggling for my life... for my life
In the wreckage... wreckage

Unbreakable chains - invincible force
Undetected - imprisoned below
In this dungeon death reaches me
Embedded under debris

Buried alive... soon to die...
buried alive... soon to be dead

Help me... I hear them digging
Uh I am dying - I'm on my own
The roof of my dungeon 
It is trembling... it's collapsing - oh noThe force which shapes blades on a hill of sickness 
The grafted skin and clinging cerements 
The overwhelming indifference of nature 
The procession of each successive moment 
The appeal for pity resonating in the void 
The black-lipped wound that mouths oblivion 
Machinery that renders debt infinite(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Nothing left to rise
Silence to infinity
Strong touch of tomorrow
Back from the destiny

Life in between
Around the eyeblink
Forever and ever
Getting touch the world
Mastering the art of fear
Invention science
Won't last anymore
Digging that grave

Auh!The time has come, to heed the call.
Days of darkness are abound.
We've lost our way, somewhere in time,
There's no compassion to be found.

Lost in the dark years, an entity of light.
Breathing life to it's future, mankind's past holds the key.

Search through the pages of history,
Find that which is lost.
Find that which is lost!

An empty cask, an ark of souls.
An ocean of feelings lies within.
Release these auras, unto the world.
The flock shall learn the way...

Speeding through alien terrain,
All colours of the spectrum,
This flight of rapture enflames my soul.
The only way, the only way...
As the aeons pass, so we fade.Vecchi e inquietanti 
Tetri e cattivi 
Fermi qui 
Con questo vento 
Con questo brutto tempo 
Da prima 
Da sempre 

I vetri rotti, tutti 
Ragnatele d'inchiostro 
Suture come crepe 
Irrequieti 
Disabitati 

E il vento, e i respiri 
Cigolii

E poi le ombre 
Guarda le Ombre 

Siamo Case Stregate 
Non domiamo MaiDecapitated body
Of information
Reassembled wrong into a smile
I always took this
Prescribed carcinogen
And watched my aura
Fall to grey
Delusional liaisons for spring loaded images
Stalking words

Dry lunged from tranquility
Cancer clustered, going nowhere fast
Turn style
Unfree mentality am I suspect?

Life tuned to a time table
Scourge rhythm, accelerated
Discordance axis spinning
Like a roulette wheel

I'm a split personality torn
In between a flat calm null
Awestruck and spellbound
I can only watchAnswer me the Slavs, what for you Jewish god, 
What for you covered boards
And golden cupolas of churches!
What for you the lying orations,
Why you get like ships!
But born the new wolves
And they tear the christian lambs!
Open your mind people!
Stops listen a shit, take the old knives
And we kill all christians!

Destroy the church kill the priest!
Build the new world!
Over fragments of rotting civilizations,
The pagan sun rises again!Hinges slowly creaking
Staggering voices leaking
With a faint memory of hate
Resembling our divine fate
Woes of winter are behind
Springs of light trembling
Hand in hand we return
Finally to sing in unison
We give thanks for your breath, father
Unto your name we sing loud and wide
With silent tongues we speak
Plugging the srings of soul
Listening to the tunes of nature
Hear the unsettling melodies
It's the dawn of a new age
Pipers yielding at the gates
Mankind dressed to mourn
Ascension of Antichrist's reign
The master's returning to reap
Sorrowful, sorrowful, filled with joy
In glory and mercy the noble destroy
Dreams of men in rigid cloth
Struggling for nightsky to touch
An ending in the uttermost fail
With a breath divine the righteous bail
Elderly Saturnal men as moon's children
With a dying soul forsake the darkened coilKobe Bryant!Take me to the twilight kingdoms, 
In your inter-planetary craft 
Give to me your wisdoms, 
Of truths yet to be revealed 
Sanctuary in the faceless landscape, 
A vacuum of emotional content 

Your dark eyes of sleeping discontent, 
Revealing to me the horrors foreboding 
Flee my loved ones to your heavens, 
To perpetuate your brothers of man 
You shall guide my heart when the time is come... 

Hope from the heavens, gods manifest, 
Must I wait till the end, 
While I alredy know the way? 
Tenth planet, nameless and black, 
Home of gods, my salvation... 

My salavation...All my life I've been waiting 
For you to bring a fairy tale my way 
Been living in a fantasy without meaning 
It's not okay, I don't feel safe 
I don't feel safe, oh 

Left broken empty in despair 
Wanna breath can't find air 
Thought you were sent from up above 
But you and me never had love 
So much more I have to say 
Help me find a way 

And I wonder if you know 
How it really feels 
To be left outside alone 
When it's cold out here 
Well maybe you should know 
Just how it feels 
To be left outside alone 
To be left outside alone 

I tell you, all my life I've been waiting 
For you to bring a fairytale my way 
Been living in a fantasy without meaning 
It's not okay, I don't feel safe 
I need to pray 

Why do you play me like a game? 
Always someone else to blame 
Careless, helpless little man 
Someday you might understand 
There's not much more to say 
But I hope you find a way 

Still I wonder if you know 
How it really feels 
To be left outside alone 
When it's cold out here 
Well maybe you should know 
Just how it feels 
To be left outside alone 
To be left outside alone 

All my life I've been waiting 
For you to bring a fairytale my way 
Been living in a fantasy without meaning 
It's not okay, I don't feel safe 
I need to pray 

Oh yeah

Please safe me

Open earth with greedy deep
Demands next victims
I enter her of mournful

As living symbol of their cry
Me - slave of eternityLoneliness - covered in clouds of sorrow
Grief - irritating the corpse of your feelings
Your mind out of control
and your head like a desolated light house.
All alone and naked in a polar desert
You can't feel xarmth nor cold.
Condemned to die in hell
Your heart is desperate for little piece of feelings
Your brain is begging
for a trace of hope...
All my efforts came out
like a waste of time.
Hopelessness and frustration
to end this life...
Where are all your friends?
What does it mean - friends?
They are tearing you apart.
The smiling hyenas.
Poison doesn't taste
as bad as you've expected
So, see you in hell...hyenas...It tends to be extreme
This self destruction in me
It tends to be extreme
Bale of calamity within

Theater of delusion
With the rood of celestial intrusion

It tends to be extreme
Manifestation of Apop's kin
It tends to be extreme

KINGS OF SPACE AND TIME.There's a place I'd like to find, somewhere in the center of my mind
Where sweet euphoric flowers grow, in every color of the rainbow
As you close your eyes and float away, you can hear the demon gardeners say:

Hellflower -- Satan's power, you grow more beautiful by the hour
You feed our hearts and you free our minds, with the essence of the souls that you devour...

Shrinking violet makes the scene in the formal garden of the queen
Bloody Mary, so contrary, how do your flowers smell?
Like pederastic priests and hypocrites, burning in the pits of Hell!

You are the butterfly, I am the honey-bee
You stop to smell the roses then you drown in the poison of my sting
You fight to keep your sanity, then you fall into a deep narcotic sleep

You slip into a dream without a care
You can see Hellflowers everywhere
The scent of evil fills the air...
You can taste the magic if you dare...

Daisies and daffodils, valium and placidyls
Marigolds and violets, dilaudid and percocets
Everything beautiful contains some evil...
Flowers always smell sweeter through a needle

Hellflower -- Satan's power, you grow more beautiful by the hour
You feed our hearts and you free our minds, with the essence of the souls that you devour...

"Hi! I am Princess Samantha! And I am surrounded by a
Sea of flowers! There are daises and daffodils, and
Dandelions! But my favorites are the poppies! They are so pretty!
And they make me so happy! And so tired... I'm so sleepy, 
And tired. And my eyes, they feel so heavy! I LOVE poppies!"

"Would you like one of my flowers?"

You slip into a dream without a care
You can see Hellflowers everywhere
The scent of evil fills the air...
You can taste the magic if you dare..

Morning Glory tells the story of Hellflowers throughout history
Growing like weeds in the Garden of Eden, 
Where the master spoke to Eve
Judas tiptoed through the tulips with a kiss that would live in infamy
Then they dragged your savior through the mud..
In the flowerbeds of Gethsemane

Where sweet euphoric flowers grew
In every size and shape and hue
And as the centurions dragged him past
He heard the demon gardeners laugh:

Hellflower -- Satan's power, you grow more beautiful by the hour
If I could I would destroy this world, and build something beautiful
That we could call ours...

Hellflower -- Satan's power, you grow more beautiful by the hour
You feed our hearts and you free our minds, with the essence of the souls that you devour...Wha-? Hey! Hey! HEY!No matter who you are
No matter what you do
You'll always be nothing
Just like everyone else
You may be famous
You made history
But it matters not
When the last man's dead

In the end everything expires
Nothing lasts for an eternity
Your life will mean nothing
And all returns to ash(Instrumental)take a moment, take your time
you got yours, now they'll get theirs

the little ones have armed themselves
with bailing wire and knives
send 'em out into the night
old men and preachers on their minds

REVENGE OF THE INNOCENTS
who's fallen, who's smiling now
REVENGE

those crosses they hold so dear
raise them to the sky
the young souls are dancing
screaming clergy heard for miles

REVENGE OF THE INNOCENTS
who's fallen, who's smiling now
REVENGE
who's crying, who's laughing now
REVENGE

the little ones are dancing
the fire has been set
raise those crosses into the air
where is your God?
he is not there

REVENGE OF THE INNOCENTS
who's fallen, who's smiling now
REVENGE
who's crying, who's laughing now

Bastards and tramps, sons of the evil
Hide behind this filthiness
You try to make justice but and is condemned

Children die for unjust causes
Children go to war to get hurt
Powerful men ferment disgrace
Like a game and innocent people will pay

A high price, a high price

Killers of power killing for pleasure
Your pain will never end
Your loss is more precious
Your life will never return
Nobody else believes in miracles

Each minute justice is drained from your hands
They can't see that wars don't take you anywhere

Someone in this place dries the tears away
Someone somewhere has something good

In their hearts, something good
In their hearts, something good
Without bad intentions

Guess how many heartaches 
These people try to hide
In this world of terror

Will we see peace someday?
It can't go on
It can't go on(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Wish me luck, wish me luckier
than the luck itself.
I have traveled far,
to the edge of distance,
guided by divine hands
through all these sufferings.

Many walls have been broken,
many have yet to be.
With both feet on the ground,
my wish will never expire.

Clinging on the urge
to stay on track
and keep moving.
The core of life is not about
how we end an episode,
but on how we dare to begin
another after another.

Wish me luck, wish me luckier
than the luck itself.
So many plans to do in such
comfortless time-frame,
as change is the only constant
in life on Earth.

Stagnation never takes its course
within oneself.
Praying at the crossroads,
hoping things would go well.

Ahead of us lies
a different standard of meaning,
adding concrete facets to
the once so-called oddity.

Time will tell should things function,
or vice versa...The intellect steadily dissolves from its slumber awakening from the sounds of weeping hallucinations running and trickling down the neck and onto the lap of a now subdued man fingers tremble at the mere simple thought of the present lifestyle a life entangled and smothered in isolated rejection  only to awaken in a pond of depressing notions and ideals submerged in flawed conclusionsAqueous...

Visual perception glazed over from the displeasure of loathing 
Perspiration simmers on the human anatomy as the torso beings to twitch 
Fists clench as the nails lodge and embed through the torn skin
 Teeth compress against themselves from top to bottom 
The jaw folds as the mental judgment races toward Self-DestructionWould you like to share the pain with Me?
Experience those darkest moments I once had.
You have bcome a part of Me and I'm inside you,
reflecting all of Myself through this suffering.

With pain, I have gained a victory over your death,
entered the darkest realm to give a light for you.
I was here, born as "a loser" in the eyes of the world,
bitterness that was taken, flesh that was torn.

Would you like to feel the pain that I felt?
Experience those darkest moments I once had.
If you said that you love Me and believe in Me,
won't you leave your glory and carry your cross with Me?

The wound, the blood, the torture,
the mockery, the humiliation,
entered the darkest hell to give a light for you.
I was here, hanging on a tree of hate and disgust,
bitterness that was taken, blood that was spilled.

Does it really matter now?
In this age of technology,
will you forget all My pain
and refuse your suffering?

A cross to take, your cross to take.
Suffer with Me,
suffer with Me...Profaner of the vices

You kneel before the crucifix
Praying loud
A thousand prays that don't exist

It makes me sick

When you caress that cross
Wearing it around your neck
My fingers itch
Want to break your fucking neck

I would love to kill you

Taste the fist of hell
Awaits you does Misery

Dead fucking the dead in the house of god
Born a Christian you were already dead from the start
Like a parasite you feed from others
Suffering I will deliver to you
Stand in my way and I will give you some pain
Like you never have felt it before

I hate your existence
I hate your existence
I hate your existence

Beelzebub(Instrumental)In the end, that's all it takes: the choice to be numb, the chance to forget what little might have been. It's not from the sky; it's born from within, ephemeral as vapor. From the back of the mind to the tip of the tongue, inevitably changes. When I say blood is a chain; when I say death is a gift; when I say I'm not coming back - what you should hear is a song from a cage. Move my lips in sacred shapes. Everything is a twisted echo in dead space. It has to be enough, because it's all there is. Writhe, mouth on mouth,a velvet tongue. Stick it in: a brand new sacrament every time. I remember you well, although you're gone, lost to the years. There's a stranger in your skin. Up in the sky, it hangs likes a curse, a scar in the center of my eye. And like a fire, it consumes, though it's burning miles away, and every shred of hope, every scrap of warmth has been denied. I rise from my worthless sleep, a worm on the ground at your feet. If miles and years melt away, I see you shining high, clear as the dawn. I should die that day. It hurts for a second and then it's gone.Nothing, Bleeds like you 
Feel Me, feel me 

Deep... Inside 
Deep... Inside 

Nothing, Nothing 
Feel me, deep inside 

Deep... Inside 
Deep... Inside 

Bleed yourself 
Bleed for me 
Bleed to death 
Deep inside(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I forgot her name.
you've gone away now..
I go far away now..
This easy farce,  you really like it
I go away now.. without another sound
A lucky time you really stole my.. 
I forgot her name
To die for, to die for, to die for(Instrumental)Aflame as it tells of my wrongdoing 
Without the life which I have chosen 

Dragging me down 
judging, repeating words 

What may escape my broken lips could never comfort them now 

So many others would have lived another life or more 
Another life for me, another taken, nothing gained 

Dragging me down 
Visions and memories 

I have forsaken 
Without reason 

And nothing is what remains 
So many others would have lived another life or more 

Judge me, take me down 

Without reason 
What is taken is with fear 
The inner monologue will not silence 

And it screams at me...Look at me, Turn away, You just can't decide 
You can't seem to break away Even if you tried 
You even think you have a choice 
You know it's up to me 
Go ahead and raise your voice 
In the end - you're comin back to me 

Stand you up And knock you down 
That's how the game is played 
So you think it's time to leave 
I think you better stay 
You even think you have a choice 
You know it's up to me 
Go ahead and raise your voice 
In the end - you're comin back to me 

You'll come around So I can bring you down 
And you'll beg me for a little more 

This is gonna hurt you more than me 
It's gonna bring you to your knees 
I'm lookin down at you, you want me now, to show you how 
That's when I'll set you free 

But you'll come around So I can bring you down 
And you'll beg me for a little more 

truth be told, I enjoy it more than you 
like a favorite mistake, I know you like it too(Instrumental)Reincarnation, is a dead refrain 
So this what it's like to be a butterfly 
Reborn 
Dead. 

Is this the gift of fire? 
Or the making of a perfect diamond 
Digital climber plummets 
In a canceled dive. 

Like a flower petal in autumn I'm brittle to the touch disintegrating the pieces swim. 

Intelligent toasters, troubleshoot through caffeine 
Backwards engineering a death span, without dreams. 

Invisible shadows slip into mirrors through ceilings and out into floors.Praedulcis lambendo labia sua libine ut eam vim et daemonium delectatur enim penetrat Watch where you step you fool, you think you know where you are going I laugh sardonically as your flesh is ripped away Black tears and severed tongue, you have no more to say Your Insolence has sealed your futile fate No hope for you, it's much to fucking late Your lover came to me the other night And begged to be part of my harem Her hips convulsed with frantic terror and delight She has forgotten what your name is Plunging deep I hear her screaming, crying out my name! Heed my warning if you think you've got something to say Your words and deeds may cost you more than you have to pay So shut your mouth you motherfucker If you do not wish to pay the price Go ahead and pray to your imaginary christ! Come forth, O Coward. Show your disfigured little face I'll still be laughing when you're gone without a trace Take back your words or I will make you eat them I'll shove them down your bloody hole Your desperate screams will echo through the forest As I devour your worthless soul! Shut your Hole!From above the thick of the woods
It's a clear path out, which everyone can see
But me, 'cause I'm down in it,
I'm lost beneath these trees
I can't see, I can't see clearly
I'm at the threshold of the crossroads
My mind is so clouded
I don't know which way to go

Don't know where I'm going
Where I wanna be
I cannot find my way thru all these twisted trees!
Gotta stop following trails I can't see
Tonight we shall see what's on the
Other side of the uncrossing
This quest can be so haunting

So I cleared a path
Where nothing stands except for me
Amongst the fallen trees
Face to face with the uncrossing
The voices can be so taunting

Before I can relax & enjoy my victory
I realize once again, my life is in
The weeds of the uncrossing
The repetition can be so exhausting

I've finally found my place in this world
It's out lost...
Lost in the woodsWelcome to my special world, "no life" man
Welcome to my real emotions
Snoop around, listen in, why do you look at me?
What are you looking for?

You're living with a tendency, a terrible dependency
To say whatever comes to mind and take us all down
From your dirty little hiding place with your ugly poker face
Are you really sure anyone will care?

So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me?

Listen to me now motherfucker! Fuck your web generation!
Dumb vox populi: decadence of our kind
What are you looking for?

You've got a disease, so tell me, tell me, please, please
Do the words and ranting keep the symptoms at ease?
A confessional - filled with the irrational - it is unbelievable
Save me from your disgrace

So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me, bring me down?
So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me?

You think you're so important, that your silly opinions count
All your trolling and your verbal instability, get the fuck away from me!

So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me, bring me down?

Try me, hate me!DECAYING INNARDS

(music by Alex Pishikin; lyrics by Alex Pishikin)

decay process
 inside my body
 I parasitize on myself

digesting my own flesh
 intestinal juices are
 corroding me from within

the innards are decaying
 unbearable pain

internal bleeding
 organs covered
 with ulcers
 smell of rot comes from within

wild cutting pain
 dreadful disease
 deadly virus
 killing me

the innards are decaying
 unbearable pain

decay process
 inside my body
 I parasitize on myself
 digesting my own flesh
 intestinal juices are
 corroding me from within(Instrumental)Duistere gangen,de eeuwig durende zoektocht.
Naar een verlangen, dat nooit vervuld wordt.

Muren die me steeds insluiten.
In het doolhof der waanzin.
Geen we bestaat naar buiten.
In het doolhof der waanzin.
Een zelfgevang gevuld met vragen.
Waar je innerlijke demonen zijn losgeslagen
eeuwig dwalend.
In het doolhof der waanzin!

Symbolen van blasfemische leer.
Hand in hand met een verlichte sfeer,
Samen naar het diepste punt.
Waar 's werelds leger werd uitgedund.
Mezelf herkennend in elk lijk.
Zag ik beelden van het vlammenrijk.
Toch bleef ik de weg bewandelen.
Hopend dit te kunnen afhandelen.

Muren die me steeds insluiten.
In het doolhof der waanzin.
Geen we bestaat naar buiten.
In het doolhof der waanzin.
Een zelfgevang gevuld met vragen.
Waar je innerlijke demonen zijn losgeslagen
eeuwig dwalend.
In het doolhof der waanzin!

De ultieme test.
Schaduwen in de duisternis.
Omgeven door de zwarte pest.
De laatste hindernis!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Let it go - stop resisting
Don't you see this for you
Your salvation
Please hold still
Don't wanna mess you up too soon
Every single hair must come off

First just a touch of the gentle steel
Barely feeling it I reckon?

Tiny trickling drops of blood
Release you

Surgical removal
Of your evil thoughts

Small incisions round your skull
Gently, gently take my time
Finally I lift it off
Throw your scalp into the flames
Must feel so good
Opened all the way
Fresh air streaming in dark corners

Let the sunlight burn
Another path
Can't control it
I have no touch

Surgical removal
Of your evil thoughts

I'll have you
Consume them yourself
Let the gastric acid
Destroy it as you die

Tiny trickling drops of blood 
Release you

Surgical removal
Of your evil thoughts

It's not over until you've paid
I feeli t clear - your evilness
Only one way to rip it awayWho made the son sinful in heed to the father? The lie will keep us alive as it always has. He who puts salt in sea and deserts land teaches us to be smoke in his fire. Only a shape inside a cloud can open the eyes of past wrath, sloth, envy. Towards demons of bodily assault I fest by sadness, decrepitude, sickness, hunger and thirst. Death will be the final triumph of demons over me. Pierce my be-ness, how did such nothing come to be? All these angels and demons no different than me. They are all stepping stones to that which we can't perceive. All I ever want is to feel close to its existence.How many lies, can people take
How many emotions, can people fake
All there is is time
Be what you are, don't fucking care
I fail you, you know i do
I'm just the fool, always the fool
Be what you are, don't fucking care
Be what you are, I don't fucking carecolourless walls,
silent, dumbed
are throwing into my ears
groans, noises, cracks, squeakes
mixed with flashes of lightnings and peals of thunders
tanks, trucks, trams drive in
elephants, ants, giraffes run in

colourless walls 
white, black, grey, yellow, pink,
flat, smooth, soft
are seating my eye in this theatre ,
where shapes, colours and forms
dance and bend
one, two, twelve, twenty four,
one hundred, a million frames per second...

due to all the delicacies the head grows fat,
towards the ground more eagerly bends 
draging a deadman along
in the abbys of this bottomless pit 

LET THE WORLD BURN!
LET THE WORLD BURN!
LET THE WORLD BURN!
I scream and i don`t spill a tear.(Instrumental)She lets down her hair and it's black as the basement of Hell.
And we go arm in arm in the next life, we're the next ones.
The love is tired, heavy & begging for rest.
But if I won't tell will you not tell?
Hedonist, Heavenly body of law.
In your thighs I'm a burning animal.
Straighten out the rivers & bind them all into a braid.
My true love's true legs are finally opening up.

The body is a miracle, put me back to sleep in a womb.
Good little bedroom, be my cocoon.
Delirious, delirious hysterical man.
This fevered pelvis, asking much, begs demands.
Inamorata, erotica's aura, oh Eros, erotic Aurora.
The thirst to whom I am slaved, big like a mountain.
Sit me at a mirror, tell me things I already know.
I'm not at peace. This is no home.(Instrumental)The fog is a sinister form of nature 
And it is creeping slowly above the ground 

But on the highway, it kills people 
A sacrifice for Mother Nature?(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Welcome to your funeral 
 Your life has just begun 
 Lie in the hearse 
 Into the morgue 
 Where the dead unite as one 

 Into the shrine you fall 
 Hear the dead, they call 
 Angel of the damned 
 Walks with me, hand in hand 

 Fly through the night which has no end 
 Into the land where you're condemned 
 Messiah from the grave 
 Lead the corpse from hell 
 Behold the morbid saint 
 Come forth from whence you fell 

 As you walk through the valley of death 
 Phantasia waits for your last breath 
 The demons stride with the Devil's bride 
 Rest in peace 

 Phantom, spread your wings 
 As the black coven sings 
 Eyes which mesmerize 
 From the crypts they riseBlood marks the sign
Fire rain
The spoken incantation
Cloaks the demons

In a way the eclipse rouses
Through the void of silence
--- if the spirits where hiding
From a storm that was soon to come

Summoning of hell
Pentagram circle sacrifice
Draw the trinity in blood
Desecration, redemption

Into your veins
And forward, inside
Black...
...in the pentagram sign

--- thousand candles light
But with pitch black darkness
We await Him
The darkest of all mysteries

Visit us with fire
Just like a dagger that cuts open
The rotten cunt of the lamb
Flames cut open our tongues and eyesMesmerized by the outline of a shadow cast by a phantom 
 This torn wet-smelling hallucination of the body 
 a pitiful remnant torn from weak old fingers 
 The smoke trembling under the roof 
 The sound of wind against the elm 
 The thin perilous condition of negative entropy 
 Discourse is not life 
 Its time is not ours 
 These are the arrows that kill sleep in the night at all hours 
 The flood is gone, the ebb has comeI AM THE ORDER, I AM THE LAW
I AM THE SWORD IN THE WIND
I AM THE EARTH, I AM THE STONE
I AM THE FLAME THROUGH SNOW

LOOK AT THE STARS
LOOK AT ARCTURUS
LOOK AT THE CONSTELLATIONS
LOOK AT THE STARS
LOOK AT ARCTURUS
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL SYMMETRY

I AM THE MAGE
THE ARCHITECT
I AM THE VISION
BEHIND THIS CHAOS
I AM THE ORPHAN
I AM THE HERMIT
I AM THE PAINTER
BETWEEN THE YEARS

SEEK THE TRUTH
SEEK THE UTOPIA
SEEK THE GODLESS REALM
SEEK THE TRUTH
SEEK THE UTOPIA
SEEK THE WOLF
AMONG THE SHEEP

COLLISIONS IN MY MONOLOGUE
ARE TAKING SHAPES
GHOSTS MATERIALIZE
TO BE REBORN

LOVE FOR LIFE REVEALS TO BE A CRUEL LIE
MY ROLE IS THAT OF A PRISONER
NOT A GUARD

IN THE VOID
MY FEEBLE SOUL 
IS CARESSED
BY NIGHT RADIANCEI shot my face and it was bad
So I had my surgeon make me plaid
Why, God, why?Voices From The Outer Space
Chanting Lines, Moving Like Slime
Propagating Their Ideals Slowly
For Being In Their Claws, Finally
Twisting Words To Bewitch,
The Followers, Blind Masses

With Their Cutting Edge,
They Remove The Opponent
Enchanted By Their Promises,
To Take Part In Their Symbiosis
With Any Question We Fully Trust,
Though They Can't Shake Down The Frost

Voices From The Outer Space
Chanting Lines, Moving Like Slime
With Any Question We Fully Trust,
Though They Can't Shake Down The FrostRuptured life!
Ripping out, blinding light, projection mesmerize
Need to heal!
Hidding wounds, caused by fools who still don't understand

The faith of we!
Human race, disgrace, slowly digging it's grave
On sacred ground!
Counting down, years of hate till we become extinct

Human cries, till the end
Awaiting the fall of skies
A species faith, no one can take
This cruelty we face each day

Eclipse of earth, sign of the curse
We finally fell to worst
All races pray, must not hate!
Still more attrocities fill the graces

Wrecking ball!
Closing on the shell but will it break this spell?
Shell of man!
Life's old dream sealed in tight we still don't understand.
The faith of we!
Showers of pain, rain of tears from human cries til the end of time!

Ruptured lives!
Wasted time in this hell look in the eyes of death.
Do you see?
Life's old dream long forgot I think I understand the cost of dreams
Each sacrifice, a little time, as world of lives unite.

Alien eyes watches us
Wait for the fall of skies
Innocent race, put to the test
By galaxies beyond our reach.You see
their truth
You know
their lies 

give me fire
give me air
give me fire
give me fire
give me air
give me fire
You see
your cross
We'll blame
our loss

I sense a presence in my surrounding environment
The night is as calm as ever, yet I feel the tension
Something out there is calling my attention

Wandering through the night with staring stars above my head
The moon directs me with its cold light on the plains
Suddenly it comes over me, the feeling of being watched
I stop and look around, but all is quiet

Then again I notice a shape, not far from where I stand
Coming closer, a figure dressed entirely in black
The mistress of the night stands before me like a twilight dream
Driven by lust I walk towards her, but she has already faded away

Confused by my sight, I continue no longer knowing why
Was it her presence that brought me to this place
Don't know where I am or where I've been
Still I got this feeling that someone is calling me.

The moon keeps laughing at me as I progress through the night
I keep following a path that seems to lead nowhere
My presence have awaken the cold misty forest
I can hear its whisper in the distant wind

Then again I notice a shape, not far from where I stand
Coming closer, a figure dressed entirely in black
The mistress of the night stands before me like a twilight dream
Driven by lust I walk towards her, but she has already faded away

I can still feel her eyes upon me
As I walk into the forests misty depth
Thunder cracks and the rain floods my trails away
She is calling me to her gloomy domains

Her dark throne rise before me, but no one is upon it
In desperation I close my eyes and try to believe
She's not a twilight dream, she's for real
Sacrificing my own beliefs I open my eyes

Then again I notice a shape, not far from where I stand
Coming closer, a figure dressed entirely in black
The mistress of the night stands before me like a twilight dream
Driven by lust I walk towards her, and she waits for meCongressional hearings, the apocalypse nearing
Speaker of the House: a deal with Faust

They come from all over the world to be here
Immigrants in search of a brighter hope
They come from the womb of the evil whores
Locals who sell me gloom through dope
They come from Kettleman City down the road
Pretty woman offering me Amway soap
They come to Coalinga to build the gallows
Search our stores for some good strong rope

Albert Gore has the guts
To lead this nation of goddamned nuts

From the dark abyss came a man of peace
Holding a torch aloft to fight the beast

I hath fathered deceit..... 

Of council to Lucifer, Belial spoke of treachery among the Zonei.
To render wretched dogs from whence they came.. 

I hath fathered hypocrisy.. 

I feel their gaze upon me
Eyes of freezing fire
Burning of funeral pyre
The aura of deceit..
None must be spared..
The crown of bitter night..
Of stygian council rebel angels took host to rent the heavens of the elder menace.. To fill the seas of beasts that Leviathan herself should take heed of. 
Vast was the expanse as Marduk strode upon the rebel angels host.. Hear me summoner! Hearken and know that your time upon the throne of disease is diminishing.. With stature of behemoth Lucifer took up arms..... 

(Scorching of the Skies)
Time of strife..
Path of war...
With haste Satan's host of rebel angels unleashed fury upon Marduk..
Unaware of elder fathers waiting upon the wings of unfettered fury..
With blinding rays of venomous light elder gods lashed upon them..
Sanguine sky.. Angelic entrails rain upon the earth.. Remember!
Lucifer.. Upon throne stands with fear of twilight.. Summon malice!
Burning gaze.. Eyes of malice, freezing the night.. Hear my cries!
Ruination.. Your time has come to pass master of flies.. The fallen! 

(The Tranquil Storm)
A great calm crept over the lands.. Once more the sun laid its rays upon the lands of earth. A new beginning had come to pass. Malice had fallen from the skies.. Tho the earth in ruins, spirits would be born anew to cleanse the lands once more.. As mother earth lamented on that day... 

Ishtar, lady of the gate of the gentle planet.. Open wide thy gate..
Queen of women, Deity of men.. I pray to thee.. Hearken and remember!
Race of Men!
O' bright and eternal rising, torch of the heavens and earth.. I beckon..
In the name of covenants sworn between gods and men.. Barra Ishtar!
Race of Men!
Eternal tranquility..
Placid Eternity... 

The black seas are swelling.... The darkly shining abyss.. 

Marduk, God of victory over the dark angels
Lord of all the lands of the foreboding earth
Son of Enki, master of magick and magicians
Vanquisher of the ancient ones of times ago
Who assigns the wanderers their places
Who assigns the wanderers their spaces...Unwanted guest in my domain
I'm not sorry that I don't feel your pain
Of your slain victimized body
Who chose to lead the herd
Of all the world's lost souls

The final certainty
What is left to bring me to soar above
What has sunk me down.
The hours go by as the sounds seem to fade

Hoow can one be mislead and over run
By some other being who has not even won
Need another chance just to look to the sky
Maybe he'll answer your last lie
Silence is at night
As the sounds rebound and pass me by
Misery takes the shape of me. and nobody's there
The distinct thought in my mind

Will I wait. wait for some beyond my thoughts
Lies wounds that can only be felt within
Progression led to death
And I am made to feel nothing. mentally unbalanced
To be somehow wrong. forever enstrangled
There are cries that do not exist
Have emotion as the sounds of death.
Paint portrayed trapped minds

Words are being spoken to me.
Words that i've always longed to hear
How can this. without doubt. my love
A forever lasting hate of every little thing

Guided by theses footsteps that were made as a dream
Prior to this outcome
It's all going to come together
As the seasons change (as the seasons change)

I hoped that time would have told me why
Why I chose the path I have ridden
The darkness in the mind. and the voices in my head
have brought me together
Otherwise. everything means nothingIn the time before my birth
My dad did not possess his land
He lived on the farm
On his older brother's mercy
My dad only had a room
Tiny little chicken coop
Wife of uncle needed space
As many rooms as possible
One night daddy jumped awake
From a primal scream above

No! It was demons

They came the morning after
Dragged uncle downstairs
Put him in the waiting car
Drove him into town
He only sat for three days
Then the county judge arrived
Lined him up in the old school
He stood up all the time
And screamed until they
Pushed him down:

No! It was demons

It seems they found my uncle
Standing over my butchered aunt
Her head was under the bed
My uncle was standing
In the middle of the room
Frozen to the floor with
Trembling hands
They took my dad in
And questioned him
If he'd heard anything

Strangest thing was
My dad's room was next to my uncle's
But pa swore
He didn't hear nothing before the scream
The whole night

No! It was demons(Instrumental)Wandering in silence by the empty streets of this town. 
Remembering moments of my childhood. Each happiness through my life.

Day after day, moments of hapiness.
The wind brush my face and it caresses my young skin
with innocent games the days spend with slowness.
Seeing the sun illuminate my way. Seeing the night protect to me in dreams.

Wandering in silence by the family memories of beautiful days.
Thinking about my parents and their caresses
Smiling in each photography.

Night after night everything is madness.
The wind brush my face, but it hurts my skin with its knives
with innocent games years spend quickly.
Seeing the darkness fill my days. Seeing to madness to handle my acts.

Wandering between the death.
Through the ruins of a forgotten past a extinguished life still latent.
Lamenting itself by its sins.Shame on me, now I'm standing alone
when I turn my face far behind
the shadow of yesteryear's sighs.
Gradually his shape fades,
degrades under the law of time,
swallowed by the book of memories.

Forgive me for what I've committed.
Many times I fly, in the light, in the dark.
I just did it pointlessly,
reaching for something,
so distant...so alone.

Dreaming for another touch, I fly so high,
I just let myself falling,
wildly drifting on the air.
Marching the sounds of my inner ill,
hear the weeping of the bleeder...shout!

Crawls...reveals...this drowning hope here beneath.
Many times I give my mind a crown and lay down,
stiff unmoved and yet posed a dying mortal flesh.
Piercing the limits, stretch upon my hollow painted nest,
keep on questioning my daily breath...what a day!

No matter how intense I strike,
the anger still here and breed inside.
I hate myself, hating the light,
this pain I feel kills me outright.
What should I do to break this chain?

It's only you, my only strength to fight,
facing my mirrors of ideal reality.
Morning's pride arrives, enter my two wounded eyes,
brings her another ugliest blazing wrath.
Will I keep survive under this earth burning sun?

Why can't I seize the dusk,
the only chance I give my misery eulogy?
Dear Lord, I chocked by the plans of Thee.
Severely amazed, torture in doubt,
questions I've drawn, left and forgotten,
I pass the answers, I let my light dimmed.DIE. DREAMING HEART.

Turning their crosses upside down 
Laughing like diabolical clowns! 
Darkness shall rule the earth 
Darkness shall rule the earthRain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain
On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me
Remembering again that I shall die
And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks
For washing me cleaner than I have been
Since I was born into this solitude.
Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon:
But here I pray that none whom once I loved
Is dying tonight or lying still awake
Solitary, listening to the rain,
Either in pain or thus in sympathy
Helpless among the living and the dead,
Like a cold water among broken reeds,
Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff,
Like me who have no love which this wild rain
Has not dissolved except the love of death,
If love it be towards what is perfect and
Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint.

Magic is in the air. As many miracles,
as many gods there in this land.
- Asgard, land of the gods -
I saw the path to him, there's no turning back.
My entrance in this world was beautiful.

[Ref.1]
Walhalla the holy land.

Hall of the proud warriors.
Place of Wotan's throne.
Am I good enough?
Ruled by the one-eyed, old man.

Murderers and scum will go to hel.
A woman who rules her reich by herself.
As the loneliest majesty.
Her face, half woman half beast.

[Ref.2]
Helheim the unholy land.

A hall of pain.
Far away from light.
No turning back.
Where ever lasting darkness rules.

[Ref.3]
Asgard, the land of the gods.

Hall of the proud warrior.
Place of Wotan's home
Am I good enough?
Ruled by the one-eyed old man.

My power becomes bigger and bigger.
Magic lives in me.
- Forever and ever -
Don't you ever forget what's been told,
or die...
- Die by my hand -Let's Go.
Oooh!Running for the hills
I find myself
In my dimension
But something come low (?)
They always here
The sounds around me

So yesterday
He really should me again
But I say
Need a little time to
win the pain
And ___ my saviour (?)

But I never sent before (never sent before)
This morning light
I can see you on my side (I can see you on my side)
From this moment 
I'm not tie (?)
I've play in
This melody is like an angel

Did you realize
No one can see
Inside my view
Can anybody see
The morning light
Does a new reality

Somewhere I am
I don't want put up to you (?)
For the reasons
But I thought be try a true (?)
Deny ourselves (?)
They can be so sweatA God Ruled Time

In a time,
where magic spells and gods ruled.
In a time,
where Wotan held his hand above us.
Welcome in a time,
in which we can live as once.
Spread your wings...
Spread your wings and fly.

[Ref.]
Life in the dark you open the wrong door.
Life in our Asgard we know it's our endevour.

I - I don't tell you lies.
Close - Close your eyes and hear.
Follow me into a time,
where father and son go on journey.
To teach to fight.
To learn to kill.

[Ref.]

Three trials must be passed
Fight, kill without fear.
When the son would be pass (as a warrior)
Fight, kill without fear.
In a time,
where magic spells and gods ruled.
In a time where Wotan held his hand above us.

Welcome into a time, ruled by Wotan.
Sooner or later you must understand.You fell from the night like an angel from the stars,
To hold me tight,
I saw your burning eyes, lips of ice, wings of fire and snow,
Together are we until I die.

You are the moon above shinning light on me
Like empty clouds we dance across the sky,
Watching dreams falling from your tears,
Together are we until I die.

Weeping tears of angel light, will you recall my name?
The blood warm mist within my veins,
The end is always the same.
I chase your dreams across the sky, how far is it till the end?
Weeping tears of angel light, take me to lost Eden.Rocking by eternity of empty abyss
I'm walking along lanes of forgotten lands
Watching dirty colors of your imagination
Paint landscape at bottom of tears lake
I wish I could only touch it's surface
And destroy this artificial neatness
Cross out forever fatal prejudice
Deliver truth of rejected suffering
Every steep is building foundation
And many unsuccess is strengthening it's stem
Every darkness is heading inside distant light
You must only catch it with hard handI have no fear.
I have strength.
I have love.
And a sound mind.There's a demon inside
It will possess you
Enter the bed
Torment begins

Sleep comes fast
You toss and sweat
Foaming from the mouth
You curse your god

Spirit runs through you
Your skin starts to crack

Profanatic laughter
You're a Satan's child!
Fallen from grace
Under Hell's spell

Old legends and myths
Of demons and witches
Not just stories... No, not just stories
Some nights are possessed
Some folks are possessed
You are possessed
I surely am...raw, roaring, with angry breath
the sea is calling me to herself
i ignored her signs
now i shoud be destroyed
lifelong suffer, dreadfull damnation
she is calling me

hear the wrecked sea
now she's calling me
she wants me to pay back
by nautical rack

north - south - east - west

goodes of the tides, ebb and flow
escort him to his end
now i will show you what it means to deceive me

goddes of the tides
goddes of the tidesSomewhere there's someone like me
Living like a gipsy in a fairytale
Somewhere around the world
Dreaming something, feeling passion, singing songs

Oh it's like an endless journey
Oh it's like falling in Love
Oh it's like a hurricane inside of me
Flowers need rain, I just need this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Tonight I break the chains
Oh oh oh oh oh! With a dream I fly
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on!
I know my friends you know my appetite

When you need love, when you need rage
It's a way to open your cage
When emotions are so strong
Try to find the notes to write a special song
The stage is like dope to me
It's all I've got and it's a cure for my disease

Oh it's like an endless journey
Oh it's like falling in Love
Oh it's like a hurricane inside of me
Flowers need rain, I just need this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Tonight I break the chains
Oh oh oh oh oh! With a dream I fly
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on!
I know my friends you know my appetite

I wanna get high every day and night
I'm addicted to this funny paradise
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on
This is where I do belong

Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Tonight I break the chains
Oh oh oh oh oh! With a dream I fly
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on!
I know my friends you know my appetite(Instrumental)(Instrumental)As rain was pouring down on the ground 
soaking every span of land 
Revelation came to mind 
Visions swarmed my eyes. 

Stranded in a sea of faces 
a sea of million faces 
Blackness- as the sky above me- 
surrounds my floating body. 

There I finally stood 
in the monstrous mist 
waiting to get vanished 
To be swallowed by the Beast. 

My hands were holding infinity 
Eternity seemed like a gasp 
As time stood still 
Like in a fall to bottomless hole. 

All was distinct and distant 
just like the smile of a familiar face. 
Only that thing mattered 
and for that I only cared 

A light. A sound. A thought. 
It scorched my mind. 
I felt sunbeams upon my face. 
I came back to life. 

Now look! A gate opens ahead of me! 
It leads me to the unknown. 
A world opens up in front of me. 
Shadows circle me in silence. 

Light springs from every corner. 
It blinds me. It cripples me. 
This place creates my memories. 
It is not the past. It is not the future. 
There is a town. I see a crowd. 
Tall buildings. Loud people. 
They spread like a disease. 
Now the city sleeps beneath my feet. 
I'm flying. I'm reaching for the sky. 
The moon dives in the water below. 
It is reflected. It is distorted. 
Those waters are greedy. 
They slowly swallow everything. 
They come in waves. 
They go with the tides. 

Where am I though? 
This place is not home! 
This place is hostile! 
I must run away! 
I must fly! 
The answer is in the sea! 
I have to find the truth! 
This place is rotten to the core! 
It has killed everyone! 
Look around! 
I must run away! 
This a nightmare! 
Is this a dream? 
Am I dreaming? 

Am I dreaming? 

Watch the bodies! 
They dance around the fire! 
Did you notice the bloodstreams? 
They flow from the top of the hill! 

Gallows surround them. 
Soulless bodies hang. 
Screams break the silence. 
Blood comes down as rain. 

They kill all those who are different. 
You must be like them. You have to. 
You must turn to whatever they are. 
For you to live. For you to survive. 

Please. Save me. 
Please. I want to live. 
I will do whatever you want. 
Please. I want to live.

Copious dark secrets within
The eyes of the owl are now upon us
Piercing through all who serve him
And as as darkness fall at it's feet
A congregation of the occult gather in robes
To burn an effigy

The flames of the pyre rise higher
Billowing above the trees
Burning 'dull care'
Fully aware of their disease

Blackened majestic forest
Tinged with the blackest intent
Of the darkest forces
Scorn of lament

The flames of the pyre still rising
'Dull care' is burning away
A sacrifice unto the owl
Beneath it's dark gaze(Instrumental)It all began with myself, the fragrant wisp of trials
Strolling through gardens blind, seeking a blossoms smile
A came upon a mortal dream, sougt its permanence
Caught a glimpse of a world fleeting from my conscience
I can feel a calling, I can heal this longing

I understood the amber swells, the ocean in my mind
I embraced tears that gave, the inner child a place
I live these lives with a course, and sailed uncarted sea
A blessing found in itself, foretold sacred release
I can feel a calling, I can heal this longing

The cycle begins, a constant bloom, no errors known
Just understanding, thoughts collide, confusion clears
There is but love, growth and change, never exchange
What is lasting, truth will never taint or spoil
Costumed in grace(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I can hear this voice in my head
Can't find the words to say
With this voice the quest begins
They need to know my name
Coming back to remember
'Cause I'm lying now
I could never remember
'Cause it's my desire

I can tell I lost my mind
It seems to be the same
You can try to tell me now
'Cause I hear the sound
I don't want to remember
I play a new game alone
I would never remember
I saw this sky tonight

But I can't forget your face

I want know until I die if you know who I am
It's time to kill who you are
I've just looked into your eyes and nothing will last in this life

My voice can take me down
Everything I hate
Everyday I see
If nothing ever change
Kill the pain when I'm bleeding
I'm just here alone
I've been dead for so long
The broken promisesPeople are in big confusion 
they don't like their constitutions 
Everyday they draw conclusions 
And they're still prepared for war 

Some can say what's ineffective 
Some make up themselves attractive 
Build up things they call protective 
Well your life seems quite bizarre 

Bridge: 
In the sky a mighty eagle 
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal 
On its wings the rainbow's light 
It's flying to eternity 

Chorus: 
Eagle fly free 
Let people see 
Just make it your own way 
Leave time behind 
Follow the sign 
Together we'll fly someday 

Hey, we think so supersonic 
And we make our bombs atomic 
Or the better quite neutronic 
But the poor don't see a dime 

Nowadays the air's polluted 
Ancient people persecuted 
That's what mankind contributed 
To create a better time

Together we'll fly somedayGoing back forth at the indelible pace of erasure, stifled and filed human staple 
Paper weights 
Chambered 
Into everything at once, now 
Well all chime in like metronomes, fluent in scale, submerged in mercurochrome, dribbling air 
Double 
Lie 
Identity 
Squared. 
Blind deafen deaden, a new retreat syndrome, that acknowledges compression, with a nod its head 
But 
Presses 
Backwards 
Just the same 
Statistical chains are fitted with teeth, in a harping audit that never will end 
To calculate 
The value 
Of life's net worth. 
Ambient claustrophobia hangs like a drop of ink in the air beneath dead halogens 
Bound to expire.Now as I walk through the scenes of disruption,
I see the dying of our generation
Adolescents are trapped, bound by chains of sin
Live as the living dead, putrefy until total death
Not to be the fools of the dark
who are deceived by father of the lies

Life goes on, the Earth still spinning around
But one day it shall be vanished,
be reduced to ashes as destruction comes
No hope or no mercy for the putrefied ones
Not to be the fools of the dark
who are deceived by father of the lies

We don't want to follow,
don't want to be the rotting youth
(x2)
Leave the scenes and follow Christ(Instrumental)Hermit haunter of the lonely glen
Common wild and heath
Lone heath and melancholy pond
The desolate face of rude waste landscapes
far away from men
A feeling I cannot describe
of lone seclusion and hermit joy
Smoke curls upwards through the naked trees
For a moment the lie becomes truth.When bullshit's on top of you with no clue left of what you should do: Forcefully align your mind and all deep cuts will heal in due time: Because - this is - your one - chance at - life: Persist - and shit - will be - fine: It's so hard to dismiss all malicious shit you're forced to deal with: But if we can laugh it off then it's apparent soon enough that: This is - this is - our one - chance at - life: Persist - and shit - will be - finne: Life is - too short to - give time to - the haters: The jealous - the spiteful - whose comments - they'll bite you: Direct - your time to - the ones who - stand by you: Who'll justify you just for being - you: People get up in your face to drag you down with spiteful hate: To crush the dreams of those who can because they fear you'll better them: But know that - this is - your one - chance at - life: Persist - and shit - will be - fine: this is - our one - chance at - life: Persist - and shit - will be - fine.In question was a wind stronger than our memories
Stupor of dresses and cry of rocks- and you were passing in
     front of these flames,
Head graphpapered, hand split open, wholly
Seeking death on the exultant drums of your gestures.

It was day of your breasts
And you were reigning at last absent from my head.A new life! A new life! A new life!
A new life in a new home world
A new life! A new life in a new home world!
In a new home world!
Through into these
New era the sunshine of its list
We're loosing our world without green
No blue but just steel all around
It's not OK
I want to leave this sheet

A brand new system to discover
(I can't breathe)
We're living history
(I want to leave this place)
All solar system's not destroyed
(Life in neon light)
The starship points to galaxy
(There's no life)
Wherever we may explode
(I want to leave this place)
A wormhole portal to home
(Portal to home)

A new life! A new life! A new life!
A new life in a new home world
A new life! A new life in a new home world!
In a new home world!
The wind rose is just a memory
And there's who regrets
The old ages on planet earth
Like eagles who lost their path
The ship has stopped sailing o the sea
Cutting through skies
Life carries on
Human survives
The strength to react
Connected our hearts
It's not OK
It's time to leave this place

A brand new system to discover
(I can't breathe)
We're living history
(I want to leave this place)
All solar system's not destroyed

A new life! A new life in a new home world!
In a new home world!High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?
Oh I see his face!

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?

Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
Oh I see his face!

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With the whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many die
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
Oh I see his face!

Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly

But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly

Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look,
Look at the tower of stone
I see your rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon oh no, who's rising
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home

Time is standing still
You, give back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home

My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is lead ahead
But it's not home
But it's not home
Ooh

Take me back
You, give me back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Going home
I'm going home

My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is lead ahead
But it's not home
But it's not home

Take me back, take me back
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Calculated violence civil silence
Indifference of good people
Generated from the steeple
Tell us more lies
Our feeble minds are paralyzed
Evoke the truth and not demoralized
A perforated system
Walls forever go on
Minds congregating minds
Crucifying eye sockets

Not even God can compensate

Books of war and hate
Dictate the mottling masses
As the bodies lie
Freedom fighters streak the sky
Pampered prophets
Malicious heroes
Whittling of creation
Cradled by martyrs
Benefactor of chaos
Manufacture of decline
Predatory forces
Bleed the weak dry

Bastardizing children
Laminating cries
Electric chair stench
Fills the dead stale air
The wilting of life
Abolish signs of hope
Diluted population
Facing devastation
Stewing pressure cooker
Molding metalizing acts are crude
Force feeding mythologies
Moral ethics are subdued

Not even God can compensate

Carnivorous defenses
Skewered on fences
Mal-intentions arise
Families now die
Superfluous tendencies
Masking evil faces
Steamroll dependencies
Forever creasing lines
Disgust becomes conform
Devising guillotine kisses
Body counts amount
And heads will fucking roll

Benefactor of ChaosBorn in the shadows of my past
Wandering in the absence of light
Fading like the flame in your eyes
Suffering like a child without a soul

As if I never lived before
Created between the chaos of life
The source of my existence gone
Believing in eternal rest

Carry my soul into oblivion
Burry my grief in your hate
Swallow my fear and let it burn
Taste the pain inside my mind

These are the signs to end our world
These are lies that have been told
This is the source that kept us dead
Eternal rest

Dreams..
They will fade, they will die
Just like hope to ease my pain

Life..
It will end, it shall perish
Like a sunset that never was ment to be born

The curse that follows me into the night
That drains the life inside
That poisons my view on light
That hunts my soul forever

Continuing the quest for my freedom
The truth behind the lies
The reason of my existence
The meaning of my fear

The loss of my soul
The sorrow that burns
The silence that screams
The solitude never ends

Reqiuem EternatumRiding forth - For the greater glory of their god 
Riding forth - To rage against their infidel 
Taking by force - Claiming holy lands as their own 
Allachibar - Can no one withstand the power of their god? 

Sent by their pope 
They rewarded tolerance 
With no mercy 
To reclaim their 
Holy lands 
They had to have slaughter 
Diplomacy a concept 
Lost on these uncivilised barbarians 

Solo: Macey 

I come forth 
An unstoppable wind of the east 
Taking under my vast wing 
New lands for my governance 
Horsemen of the open steppe 
No one can withstand 
"If you had not been so evil, I would not have come" 
For I am the wrath of god 

Solo: Crompton 
Solo: MaceyI am the one who preys on weak
I offer everything they seek
And I am the one who comes richly endowed
Harvesting crops of fields that other have ploughed

I am the one, lascivious

I am the son of one below
The progeny of beast of woe
And i am the son who comes into the daughters of men
Destroying all and make them want it again

I am the son, lascivious

He is the one desacralizer
He is the son of the enticer
The all seeing subterranian keiser
He is the way he is the way

I am the way...
And you invited me to stay
How ever fair and pure. You crave the wand
You see through me what lies beyond

I am the one, lascivious
I am the one, lascivious
I am the one, lascivious
With magic potion niveousEverything here is so cold
Everything here is so dark
I remember it as from a dream
In the corner of this time

Diabolic shapes float by
Out from the dark
I remember it was here I died
By following the freezing moon..

It's night again
Night you beautiful
I please my hunger
On living humans
Night of hunger
Follow it's call
Follow the freezing moon..

Darkness is growing
Eternity opens
The cemetery lights up again
As in ancient times
Fallen souls die behind my steps
By following the freezing moon..I present to all senseless actions
Its presence against provokes aggressive reflections
A sick attitude against all the crowd
Unwillingly spilling all my proud

Hidden emotions crucify my guts
Respect grows thinner it really rots
Mostly I obtain
Oh so speechless
Spare you my opinion
And contain tearless

I mix in
Leaving you no point of view
A voice yearns for trouble
No respect from you
There is no scary explanation
It has chosen you as its location
No implant its very own seeds
Translating them into your deeds

The cause remains anonymous
It could have happened to all of us
Coming, leaving, unexpected
Can this ever be rejectedKill All Nations

Crawl under the stone 
Await the time of fear
Split the flesh from bone
Cry the rivers of million tears

Blind lead the blind
Just one step too far
A life to rewind
Get back to the start 

Silence is golden
Ignorance is bliss
Fell down from heaven
In a shower of piss

Build up a wall
Brick by fucking brick
United we fall
Under a flag of shit

Rise up - Burn the flags
Rise up - Erase the tags
Rise up - Rape the days
Rise up - Kill the nations

Crawl under the stone

Rise up - Kill the nationsIn this world, the land that God created
Men must join together as one
But now, when hatred surrounds
Then we ask, "can we share this life together?"

Won't you take a look at our brothers and sisters
How many of them
who let their souls being strayed?
Some people learn from all these tragedies
Bu themselves, they cannot help and save

So take a little time to think of it
Before everything's too late
About the world and the living
Which not eternal nor endless

"In years later,
all will realize what they have done
And they will try to throw the others the blame
Though it's still possible for us to cease
But it won't be the same as before"

Nothing same, every thinge changes
It's not the same anymore
This is Scripture before struggle
Before you go to the battlein the depths of ocean 
near the first of the three gates of hell 
sleeping a demon 
who look like a great sea serpent 

inspiring terror in the head of dreamers 
infernal guardian of the seas 
he wait for the final judgment 
to release all the demons 

Leviathan 
terror of the deep 
leviathan 
great god of water 
your reason is the instinct 
of the resiliant man who know 
at the science and the cradle 
of her species in the seas 

bringing illusions 
like the loch ness and kraken 
to hide her existence 
and make a non-sense 

once the god of atlantis 
now a demon for the sons of god 
her empire was destroyed 
but her ambition is now increaseWhat else should I be?
All apologies.
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay.
What else could I write?
I don't have the right.
What else should I be?
All Apologies.

All in all is all we are [x20]"For One Last Time"

Of blood bloted tears 
Filling up my sorrowful eyes
From personal fear 
And of all utterly lies .
The wrath inside 
Wait for the doomsday ,
The sinful suicide 
Veil into the cause of fear .

And so is the life on the own end 
No either already nevermore .
All comes with belief ,
The life in which I am never live .Appleseed
Free thought has been hollowed 
Furnished with myopia 
Spin drift misconception 
Inducements stagnate 

Appleseed. 

Life inside an envelope 
Built on lie after lie 
From complex layer of illusion 
Can you recover your soul? 

Choking down expressions of homage 

Reshaped desires prosecute attrition rate 
Slotted into a life of graft 
Defining said contours, through make-work production 

Processed stimulation in their ten thousand mile stares 
The sour taste of a mouth full of ashes, disordered introspection 

Head is in the sand 

While subdued integrity, surpasses recognition 
Perspicacious dreams of liberation remain illusions.you wanna be the way i am but you could never understand 
you shave your fucking head then you turn your back on your best friends,

Live amongst the human kind
Source of evil from below
Not from the church, or cathedral 

Out in the fields they gather around
And form a circle for the mass
Worship demons. devils, darkness of the night,
You can hear them call

Take thou my blood, my flesh, my skin and walk
Holy Bahr Moth father of my life
Speak now, come now, rise now
From the forest, from the fallows, from the fields and live...

Sacrificial death by the cross
To strengthen the cult for further mission
To overtake the Churches of God
Replace with Evil and Hale Satan
Dying wil be done on earth
As it is in Hell...
So prepare to face your doom
'cause no more I will tell...I cross the sweet catacombs of a morbid cemetery
I dig a sepulcher until the last grain of sand
I violate that sad and gloomy coffin
Infested of worms and rotten meats

Bones!
I take them to the mouth
Under a silvered and bizarre moonlight
To the beautiful eyes of bats, owls and candles...
...In my insatiable thirst for blood

Candles!
Which illuminate my way back home
But, before, I satiate my insane thirst
My necromantic pain which numbs Satan
With my untamable lusts and intimate depravitiesWelcome to my world I'm your shadow
You can see me in your night window
Don't be sad I'm starting a game
with your fucking empty brain
Wake up early in the morning you're clear,
you are beginning this day here comes your fear
Cause I'm here and I'm there
your shadow is with you everywhere
Throw your fear away let's go out
you're cool person wah
Leave your worries it makes you older
lift to paradise is out of order

I'm an ice and fire together
And you can't see the light never
Your mind there are only words
Do it again if you wanna be a corpse
You're crying but I'm smiling I'm singing you fucking dumb thing
I'm only an observer I don't wanna teach
my motherfucker my bitch

Hi, here we go again
we're PQ, we aren't like TQ
If you tolerate this you're lost in the earth
you are a living dead man
Now everybody tells you what you have to do
Stop and look around try to find the truth
There are so many children which can't breathe this air
but it's our suffocation their life is hate

Stop! Who do you think you are a fagot
for me you are a very easy target
We'll take you down 6 feet under
see you later in the next life you motherfucker!

What does it mean friends?
They are tearing you apart
The smiling hyenas
where are all your friends
Poison doesn't taste
as bad as you're expected
so see you in hell... hyenas...

Where are all your friends?
Say what? say what?
We play the grind hop shit grind hop shit
PQ and MP play the grind hop shit(Instrumental)These castle walls are finished at last
Will they hold out the elements or just the past
Bury it all out in the yard
Down by the pond and the old livestock

[Chorus:]
Exactly where I wasn't shown
The site of his ashes now buried in snow
Now take this flock far into town
They have eaten our fields down close to the ground
With the master dead and planted deep
Who can possibly care for these tired sheep

[Chorus]

I can't reap what you've grown
I can't plow these fields alone
I can't bring the harvest home by myself and myself alone
These castle walls are finished at last
Will they hold out the elements or just the past
And bury it all out in the yard
Down by the pond and the old livestockNormoal droag ik ne gele pul

Randomized, trembling steps of the god you once held high
Echoes throughout your falling domains
With bleeding hands this god lays within the temple
An eternal soul dispersed due to disbelief

Blackened landscapes, burning cities
Revolving endlessly is the cycle of time
Replaying the forgotten wars of total annihilation
Leaving your wold once again in chaos

Destruction caused by blindness - ends a world

12. Live to LoseI travelled far and wide 
Searching..... 
On paths trodden 
Only by so few 
I uncover the doorway 
My journey nears its end 
I complete the ritual 
Which grants me passage unto - 

This ancient tomb 
Of kings - I open 
I break the seal 
Of three thousand years 
What foul enchantment 
Will befall me? 
What will I 
Behold? 

Leaving the sun behind 
Down passages so dark 
The torch my only weapon 
Against this vault of darkness 
Soon I lose my way 
Attempt to trace my footsteps 
My torch fading fast 
As I see a chink of light 

My pace quickens 
Running towards the distant glow 
I stumble on the entrance 
The awesome spectacle brings me to my knees 

I behold the tomb of kings 

On huge pedestals they stand 
Mounted, weapons in hand 
Once kings of this land 
Their statues stand 
Monarchs long forgotten 
Rising towards the light 
Once proud lords 
Will rise again...... 

Terror in the air 
Ancient tombs opening 
Grotesque figures emerging 
Still dressed in regal splendour 
Followed by their servants 
Entombed when their lord died 
Empty eyes look towards the surface 
As foretold: They rise again 

Solo: MaceyDe pankraker legt bloot
geheugen en gedachten
Hij heeft een broertje; dood
Zij zullen de pijn verzachten

Pankraker!

Waar hij komt kraakt de pan
en gluurt de schors naar buiten
Zijn tedere kus heeft menig man
voorgoed de ogen doen sluiten

Pankraker!

Hoofdpijn is verleden tijd
hier helpt geen zwachtel of gaasverband
Je gekwelde geest voorgoed bevrijd
met pankraker in mijn hand

Pankraker!Morbid ways to live this life! 
Which is just fated to end! 
Condemned to relive the past 
Memories sharpen the knife. 
You stand waiting for your torment 
The fear is taking over! 
This pain is too surreal, 
Your worthless body has to kneel! 
Kneel!!

Fatal attraction led to your death! 
Absent minded you followed the blind! 
Blurred the image of purity! 
While taking your last dying breath! 
Be prepared for what`s behind! 
Drowning deeper into obscurity! 
This suffering overtakes you! 
The bonds of time breaking you!

Further Into Damnation 
Wanting salvation 
Further into your doom 
Into your tomb! 
Morbid Beliefs 
on your path. 
Into your heaven 
Into your grave!

Self depicted gods of this world 
How did you deserve your throne? 
Built upon blood and bones! 
Rotten the earth has turned! 
Disciples into death are thrown 
Into darkness that no one owns 
Too weak to live by themselves 
Too dead to find themselves!

Further Into Damnation 
Wanting salvation 
Further into your doom 
Into your tomb! 
Morbid Beliefs 
on your path. 
Into your heaven 
Into your grave!

This is a monument 
Built for my HATE 
From the bones 
of charlatanic GODS 
Fuck their prayers 
burn their BOOKS! 
This is a monument 
built from your FEAR 
From the bones 
of your GOD! 
Fuck your prayers 
and your HERESY 
Your god WON`T TAKE ME!Age, 
And separation, 
And cold. 
When winter comes 
Where shall I find 
The shadows of the earth? 
The walls stand 
speechless and cold. 
In the wind 
The weather-vanes rattle.(Instrumental)"Hey pizanos! It's the Super Mario Bros. Super Show!"

"It is a legend nobody will forget. Everyone thought King Koopa had left the Mushroom Kingdom, but then...his doom ship attacked! King Koopa was back with the greatest danger ever known, his Koopa Kids! Using their new super powers, the Super Mario Bros. rescued Princess Toadstool, and beat back the evil Koopa Family."
"I'll get those plumbers!"

"It's-a me! Mario! It's-a me! MARIO!!!"Moss- dress me and lay me in an animal grave with my woman
Oh Ground- lend us your name.
So the Indigo one will seek us to raise for her own, sincerely naive.
We'd been yearning for all of our lives for such peace.Come on back and hold me down
You took the light from out my eyes
Your gods are cruel
And your faith is unkind
And I will bury you

No matter this - they are blind
And I am helpless at their feet
Two minutes before
You were shaking at my side
Where are you now?

Lucius: Give us the proudest prisoner of goths
That we may hew his limbs
And on a pile, ad manes fratrum
Sacrifice his flesh
That so the shadows be not appeased

Tamora: Titus, rue the tears I shed
A mother's tears in passion for her son
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee
Oh, think my son to be as dear to me
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome;

But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets?
Come back, come back to me, my child
I will heal you of all your wounds
Come back, come back to me, my child

Tamora: I will find a day to massacre them all
And make them know what 'tis 
To let a queen kneel in the streets
And beg for grace in vain

If I had a knife
I would cut out your heart
If I could untie these chains
I would wrap them 'round your throat

I will find a way to take your life for this
Set me free for one more day;
That day will be your last

Aaron: Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top
Safe out of fortune's shot
And sits aloft, secure of thunder's crack, or lightning flash
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach

As when the golden sun salutes the morn
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
And overlooks the highest peering hills(Instrumental)I want to feel you veside me
Touch the arching of your wings
To know the taste of your flesh
Deep inside me

Gasping rutting filthy fucking
Flay the skin from off my hide
And ride me like your demon hound
I can't wait for ecstasy

I'd give it all up for you
You'd be my sweet demon whore
I'd give it all up for you
If you would swallow me whole
I'd give it all up for you
If you'd be my sweet whore

Dissolution for the putrid stench of rutting
Soon the taste of salty sweat
I'm licking off your ass
Breast so ape(?) and swollen
That they make my ball sack ache with yearning
Grinding on me so hard that you moan in demon tongue

Bite as we climb
Scream as we embrace

Gasping rutting filthy fucking
Flay the skin from off my hide
And ride me like your demon hound
I can't wait for ecstasy

Gasping rutting filthy fucking

I give my flesh to you
This carnal rapture
Is my only desire
My lust know no bounds(Instrumental)(Instrumental)evil's been making its rounds in this town
the preacher cries
it's time to exorcise your demons
oh my
if your body is a temple
then the devils in it

a serpent's lair
are you in league with the Devil?
or with the house of The Lord

cast him out
on this day
show yourself Satan
ya gotta kneel and pray
when the moment comes,
you'll be free from sinning

blessed father, what do you say?
can a man like me, come in and pray

am I cleansed, from the sins of man?
am I washed, in the blood of the lamb?
am I bathed in the light, hell yes I am
am I washed, in the blood of the lamb?
will I take up serpents, hell yes I will

we've been drinking the poison
and chewing the glass
it's a little more electrifying
than the same ol' Sunday mass

we got dancing in the aisles
and a rattle in the air
they call us crazy down in the
valley
as if our congregation cares

blessed father, what do you say?
can a man like me, come in and
pray

am I cleansed, from the sins of man?
am I ashed, in the blood of the
lamb?
am I bathed in light, hell y es I am
am I washed, in the blood of the
lamb?
will I take up serpents, hell yes I willLay you on the table 
Segregated to die 
Holding down your limbs 
Gouging out your eyes 
My maker came from the depths of hell 
To feast on your life 
Struggling, I'll tie you down 
I'll cut you with this knife 

Parasite, your dead to me 
Your time is up, it's plain to see 
Strapped to the cross, this is it 
Time is up you piece of shit 

Stench of decay, in this morbid hell 
This is how it ends 
Your future is not well 
Preach your catholic cult 
You must be fucking thick 
Follower of Jesus 
I'll put you on a stick 
Hand dipped in toxin 
Bone breaks the skin 
Wage a war with Satan 
You will never winI force through the opening
I claw through veil after veil

Absent purity
Painted dawn

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation

I choke the apocalyptic trumpet
With my power
Resounding though the arcangel
Like marrow

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation

Absent purity
Painted dawn
The future is nowhere
The past is gone

Its icy grip is upon my throat...
I feel the chill of its touch...
My mouth is frozen shut...

My spirit is covered in frost
And I have lost all sense of knowing...
A Savior's light... A Savior's might...
Give me strength through the endless night...

I shake the cold of death from my limbs...
Color returns to my flesh...
The enemy will pay for his deceit...
I grasp the hilt of my sword
And step from my tomb...

And with this blade of Light
I will now show you the true meaning of death...It's the end of the road
And someone had sold all of my gold
I'm so tired of walking in the sun
There'll be no race to run
But maybe one game to win

The long empty road and I walk alone
Because the winter is near
I'm searching for a place I can hide
Under favour of night
Would you fail me in need?
Because the days come and go
When it's dark there's still a candle in my room
When it's cold I feel something keeps me warm
Leave the cold outside be with me when I die
This time I'm reaching outer lines

I'll be where I can reach the sky
In a land where the blind have sight
And I don't need to fight, I want to know
If there will be an endless summer?
How long will the moon shine on and cover the sun?
How far will the night extend into my life?
Don't be afraid in there's no tomorrow

When it's dark there's still a candle in my room
When it's cold I feel something keeps me warm
Look at me I'm still a prisoner in chains
Now my time is running through the open hands
Until now I wasn't able to break free
Leave the cold outside be with me when I die
This time I'm reaching outer lines

It's the end of the road
And someone had sold all of my gold(Instrumental)Morte

C5H14N2Do you really believe your self? 
Whom are you kidding!? 
Of course there is no truth! 
You keep repeating yourself 
and I keep lying to you. 
I am you and you are me. 
But I have a mind off my own 
hidden deep beneath. 

You run and you climb! 
You run towards the mountain top! 
The outcome is still out of sight. 
Your expectations differ from reality. 
Can't you perceive it as I do? 
See the world like it truly is! 
You refuse to accept it!? 
You cannot change a thing! 
Wake up by accepting it! 
The melancholy of resistance will crush you! 
There is no salvation! 
The mountain top is the end! 
There is no way out of this! 
Yes! You must despair! 
Believe me! 
I am not your enemy! 
I want you to live! 

These are the words of a coward. 
Those who do not dare, they shall perish. 
To reach salvation I must cut all ties. 
To reach freedom I must be brave. 
I will give up everything that I own 
to be inside a forest of stars. 
No lies will interrupt my ascGlobal terror in the name of god
Drowning the godless in their impure blood
The ivory towers crumbled into dust
Ashes to ashes - now all reason's lost

Follow the trail of the dead
Towards the gallows pole
Innocent blood shall be shed
For the gods

War on terror in the name of god
Vengeance - you're sentenced - being responsible
Clash of cultures - new enemy stereotypes
Armies marching united by a lie

Follow the trail of the dead
Towards the gallows pole
Innocent blood shall be shed
For the gods

...blood for the gods...

Fear - we're blinded by fear
Freedom is dead, lies sold for truth - neither forgive nor forget
The harm done to us - we're blinded by hate
Reason is dead when we head for revenge

...head for revenge...

War on terror fought for freedom's sake
A new world order follows in its wake
A new age slavery for our brave new world
Freedom removed to keep it safe

Follow the trail of the dead
Towards the gallows pole
Innocent blood shall be shed
For the godsSodomize thru the night - who has killed the fucking light 
What the fuck do you expect to see 
When Jesus lying naked in front of me 

[Chorus:] 
Goat in pain - the satanic reign 
Who has killed the fucking light, 
Who has killed the fucking light, huh? 
You are all doomed to misery 
So fuck some goatcorpses in praise of me 

[Repeat chorus]Nobody in this palce
Tried to describe
Their own cemetery
Knowing his own murderer

Through a liar depressive
Many ingenuos are led to fall

In a world that only engenders
Illusions and curse
In the beginning everybody was upper
To all and every people inside

Everything is ridiculous and funny
But when they're caught
In their own disgrace
The regret is recognized too late to save

Everywhere  in this world 
There's someone who'll show
The destructive and murderous future
Where death and illusion growCrippled wounded puppets incomplete 
Weave silken drapes of misery and wire nets of grief 
Within us slides the worm of time and history 
Give yourself away 
A deaconry to vanity 

Rusted cog-wheels in the earth machine 
Carrying woes and minor misfortunes we raise a tower of sin 
Innocence opposed to claws and strings 
Give your youth away 
A deaconry to vanity 

Asleep and dreaming safe 
In the shade of the shadow of death 

Easy prey to the beast of guilt 
Our humble mortal art cannot describe the pains we feel 
Hereditary suicide epiphany 
Kill your dream and pray 
A deaconry to vanity 

Led by the vague footprints Chimera leaves on sand 
Content to hold dead unicorns buried in their hearts 
Acrobats and zealots come and leave en mass 
Until we leave the scene 
A deaconry to vanityLiving after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn

We're made as one
I've been denying the truth
Ignoring my fate of life
Is this the time to face tomorrow? (the dream is over)
No turning back (the feeling's gone)
This is the time to look ahead (and i'm still here)
No turning back (in pain)
No turning back

Images appear in dreams dilated
Far away from me
I've been denying the truth
Turn into words the revenge he deserves
The dream is over

Leaves your soul alone
People lives with their lies
Shouldn't live without you
Mind

Fuck you allA chronic complaint of dimness
Prevails your profound ideology
A romantic vision of a "master race"
Attained through coercive forms of authority
Your observance is negligence
If you see the threat from different cultures
We're all in this sinking ship
All of us together
Where does the white man stand?
Where does the black man stand?
Where do we all fucking stand?
KNEE DEEP IN THE SHIT!
Look into yourself
And you'll find the real oppressor
To a life of unchallenged hate
It's you who's the nigger!I am across the ocean,
Under the mountains,
Among the trees,
And above the sky...There are the ruins of us
Jagged edges upwards, clawing at the sky
There, our twisted bodies froze into these forms:
Daggers aimed at unseen hearts

White light came down
We died with a curse nearly past our lips
And fell six shallow feet
It could have been paradise
But the ground was frozen
And all our flesh was swelled with rot

Give us our peace, blistered and broken
So this day might end
Give us a home, barren and black
Shattered asunder

Take from our hands every song
Until there's nothing left
This is our grave, shut like a lock
Stronger than even the stones

Despite our fondest dreams
We won't ever fly from here
Although our hearts are young
It's true, we did fly once
For a moment some years ago
But failed to find the sun
And so we fell

And you are right to doubt us
To say we are all cowards
To think that we were weak
We could have fallen so much farther
Or bled for some much longer

But even then, its here we would remain
Were you there, oh father
When we died beneath the flood?
Were you there?

We called your name a thousand times
Please, let us be forgotten
Though our bodies stain your lands
We may hear your children's faces
But death is all we are
Not love, not life, only the death we died(Instrumental)You waste your minutes, knowing it's time from your life
The time is your guidance, leads you away from the child
And it will be with you anywhere
Looking back into the past shows me the days I was wrong
Even moments of pleasure were taken away by the hands of time
But there always arose a new day for me
I can't deny...

Time after time we return
Out of darkness into light

Day by day people astray, they're watching how the world sheds a tear
We are dancing on a tight-rope, sowing the seeds of a venemous game
But there's not even time for a little handshake

I know that we can't go on as we want
Even earth has changed it's way around the sun
But the seconds still run
Soon they will be lost forever

Time, what have you done to me?
You slow down this turning wheel
I know the years are getting colder now
Trying to get the speed again

You slow down this turning wheel
And a mountain you throw in my way

There's a place I've never seen, lend me some time from your life
It seems to be an acceptable
A lot of your dreams won't come true to you
As sure as this game will go on and on
I can't deny...
Night after night we're used to the hope
That the morning brings us gold...Surging crowd of people
You look at yourself
You first your blood
you want revange

You pick out someone from crowd
He himself, is the victim
He's sin is being god
Stake transfixes he's body

Corpses are around you
Cadaverous smell spreads
Desire still does not abait
You must kill again.

Your fate is sealed
You know it too
Pitchfork of evil
Strikes through you

You! Want! Revenge! Pain!Here we burn under the cosmos 
Spreading the ashes of death 
Some were dwellers of the threshold 
Others were part of the fire itself 
Some spoke with a dwellers tongue 
Others stayed silent of the fire's mourn 

In the end we are alone 
Meant to dwell on a solace path 

Cold and absent of life 
I carry the fire's scorn 
On the dweller's threshold 
Though the fire I'm born 

On the dweller's threshold 
On the dweller's threshold 
On the dweller's threshold 
On the dweller's threshold 


And in the fire, I walk alone 
Searching for something that can never burn 
And through the fire, I can see the end 
Where death waits for me to burn againGot demon's chills
Though it's hot as Hell
Should've ignored Pepe's coupon
Should've stuck to Taco Bell

Pepe Gonzalez cooked up some bad food
Pepe Gonzalez didn't wash the dishes
Pepe Gonzalez didn't check the date on the sour cream
These homey little businesses are not what they seem

Should have heeded the warning
Posted by the county on the door
I've been throwing up all morning
My stomach muscles are soreWhy wait to speak, when you feel the urge to communicate
Nothing matters, what is real? Come back to reality
Riddles haunt these lands, a tyranny of wrath
As dark as it sounds, a theatre of fear

Let your voices rise, let them rise
We got to set the bill, we got to set it right
Let your voices rise, let them rise
Just scream a little louder, silence will break down

Confusion lies, in all our words
What makes destruction inevitable

I challenge this world, with all its pitfalls of trust
Let your voices rise, let them rise
Let them rise! 

Why wait to open the shackled door
That leads us away from shadow and grief
Riddles haunt these lands, a tyranny of wrath
As dark as it sounds, a theatre of fear

Theatre of fear - a tyranny of wrath
Theatre of fear - as dark as it sounds

Let your voices rise, let them rise
We got to set the bill, we got to set it right
Let your voices rise, let them rise
Just scream a little louder, silence will break downGirl, you really got me goin'

So dangerous and beautiful

Yeah... It's magical baby

Everybody needs somebody
In this circus - Take me to your fairytale
My unknown dancer, my desire
And now I know want you, now I need you, can't resist you
Take my hand and dream away
My unknown dancer, my desire

I see your legs in a twirl
And the fire is starting to burn deep inside me
It's like a vision - A sweet sin
Yeah... Every move drives me crazy
Yeah... It's magical baby

Everybody needs somebody
In this circus - Take me to your fairytale
My unknown dancer, my desire
And now I know want you, now I need you, can't resist you
Take my hand and dream away
My unknown dancer, my desire

Maleficent looking pretty take me to your emerald city
My heart is beating loud, I'm hypnotized
Now won't you feel me...?
You're my red queen, so terrible, your beauty is unbearable
I want you hard, I'm feeling paralyzed
Now won't you feel me...?

Yeah... Every move drives me crazy
Yeah... It's magical baby

Everybody needs somebody
In this circus - Take me to your fairytale

Take my hand and dream away
My unknown dancer, my desireHow much is a palace worth?
Far more than this mound of dirt
Charge me what you will
I'll still make out in the deal

I'll buy the whole bloody island if I have to
And turn the damn thing upside down

There's more here than shards and bone
I won't rest 'til my spade chips a throne

I'll buy the whole bloody island if I have to
And turn the damn thing upside down

Too old are these ruins
I will make some new ones(Instrumental)His endless laughter echoing in the infinite ever multiplying halls of my mind.

Father do not feed no one else,
Do not give them the fuel you made me from.

You give me and I give back,
Would they ever understand?

You gave me your mistress,
I lick your semen from her bloodstained feet.

A whore gave birth to my mother,
I do not know what to do.

Slaughtered black angel you are.

You will no longer be afraid of anything,

Neither of the dreadful dreams,
Nor the fair child of past failures.
Faith does not matter anymore,
Serenity is forever yours,

For you are the anomaly that did not die.
You can wield every image at will
You can scorch sleep

You have chosed to name your success
As the keeper of the great darkness.
Everything that stung you named order.

And everything that you are chaos.
You give reasons to fight for the hopeless,
As you took it from them.

Even if you fail, you've been touched.
By the everlasting flame,
That unites us all.

No one can understand,
How happiness does not matter anymore.

There is no more fingers to point,
When reunited with the true self.

For he resided in a netherworld

Where you fell from.

The fountain of uncertainty is a mirrored monument.

Sculpted in the borderline of the worlds on high and low.

Sculpted by you and yourself.

Do not tell the self that he is on the wrong side.

Warm is my head when my heart turns east,
Longing for an eternal return to father.

Warm was the heaven's throne when she shone,
Longing for her son in his vast dreams.

Warm is the home of the son,
Longing for terror.

Warmth is never to be abandoned,
Warmth is never to be seeked.

Cold was the mind without the cross,
The cross found its way to the candles.

Cold was waxed out of nightmares,
The candles they are the black light.

Cold was the mind in darkness,
The black light is darkness.

Fertilize I must the pain induced by love,
Love is a face of lesser Evil
The rapist is the true father
In the mind of any woman

The friends of many are different,
Of the same father,
The blood that unites us
Disgusts me blind.Once there was a child
feeling the pain
Now he's insane
Look at them now
tearing the flesh, ripping
Into his brain

See how they can play
crushing my strength
releasing infernal rage
I feel it in blood
tethered by fate
Night is my cage

Nothing enters my world
Timeless and still
My bones still scream
Men shattered and drifting
claim to recover me
Now feel my rage

Cold, Vanquishing, Spirit

See me        Laughing
Crushing      your skull

Breathing     Letting go
snapping      letting go

Your bond, your word
Vapid and draining
No more shall I
Respect your world

Once there was a child
felling the pain
Now he's insane
Once they were like me
touching disease, breathing
deaths slow embrace

Feared, wanted, and tired
traitors, they follow me
Dripping into the night
They take me away
never too still, fearing
desiring what they do see

Blades, swords at there
throats, lapping their
vanquishing spirit
Into my veinsFear, is all that I see...
Earth on fire, evolve me
Immortal sphere, blue and red

Shine like a sun in the space

These filthy parasites infest my corpse
- I have cancer called mankind -
With hate I feel they eat and creep
- From the air that burns my Breath -
Look into the depths of infection
- Insects to crush without mercy -

Fields of atrocity, built for your
maggots create the order
In this kaos....

Fear, is all that I see...The last time i heard 
No one was talking 
The last time i saw him 
No one was there 
A part of me that i knew 
A part of me that was alive 
Cries filled with blood 
Free me and i'll be myself 
Nice and understanding 
I'd like to have clear account 
To start a real life 
A part of me that i knew 
A part of me that was alive 
Cries filled with blood 

Again alone it's not fair 
I tried so hard to be myself 
People are disguessed of me 
They are acting strangely 
An old sister has reminded me 
Person known from older ages 
That maybe loved me 
But only till friday 

I heard from old sister 
The words of strange songs 
Her scream has stopped long ago time 
Sentenced for silence in blood 
Old sister isn't here anymore 
In my heaven you can hear screams 
I think about that sometimes at night 
In the morning they'll free my hands again 

I saw her face 
It was illusion of evil 
Evil was her name 
Evil was her identity 
I remember scream 
Hands filled with blood 
I became their prisoner 

I was good blind idiot 

I'm worried for all souls lost in time 
I'd like to get out of here to free them 

Again alone it's not fair 
I tried so hard to be myself 
People are disguessed of me 
They are acting strangely 
An old sister has reminded me 
Person known from older ages 
That maybe loved me 
But only till friday

Old sister isn't here anymore 
In my heaven you can hear screams 
I think about that sometimes at night 
In the morning they'll free my hands again.Nobody can feel Satan's grasp as deeply as I do.
The claw is evermore...
The grasp empowering me, oh lord I am nothing against your might. You are everywhere and all that I do I look for you. I submit myself and don't you feed no one else!
I want to be your cancer. How empty my soul becomes when I stray away from thy path. I know I am not pure oh father of hell, separate me from me. Take away all meaning from me. I will destroy my life for you to shine through me. I want to dissolve into your void of vomit. Without the holy ones.
Oh father what should I do when they step inside my fire. Father, only love me, I will sacrifice all children for thee. Father don't trust me, but grant me thy all seeing dark. Father I am weak but grant me thy immortality. I will destroy myself for a moment of your glory.
Immortality through destruction of the remainders of mortality. Being made aware of the fact that some things are out of your hand.
The gates will open again and darkness will seep into light and ignite unity.Death was the only thing that she saw, an utter blackness of uncertainty. She was absolutely disgusted by her conclusions, because conclusions were an act of certainty. Everything in life was to do with a false sense of certainty. She noted that she accepted her dreams right away, even if paranormal things were happening in them, and she told that the same would happen in life. Nay! It happened everyday in life! That everybody were coming to terms with inner and outer unacceptableness and they were first
torturing themselves and later coming up with new conclusions from these breaks of certainties. This was reminding every human being that life; their utmost certainty will be crushed by death someday. Nay! It was crushed everyday by death. Death was life, but life was an illusion, certainties were transient illusions speckling in the sea of death.(Instrumental)(The creeping disease)
Quiet was the earth upon that day.. As Hell bore from the depths and surfaced upon all creation as molten from its cinder pyramid. Beasts spawned of heaven whom hath set upon lakes of burning ash forever scarring angels as beasts of loathsome appearance..
This.. the day of reckoning.. Judgement hath come unto men and women alike.. The skies were painted red that day forever staining the earth with their crimson showers. God himself hath been silenced on this day. Malevolence shall forever shape the lands and heave the oceans..
Abomination! Pandemonium hath enslaved the lands.. 
Mass inception! Children of the pyre! Obtained vengeance! Claim the throne!
Hovered on wing, of impious suns.. Dire in arms, left untold.. 

I sung of chaos and an eternal night.. 
I raped the lands of all his light..
Cast out, i hath returned of hell..
Upon my blade the heavens fell..
With fierce winds of Orion armed as bodies of angels fell as autumnal leaves upon his tranquil stream....
I have journeyed! Of myriad dimension of unpass space and time. I hath awoken the sleeping hounds of centuries old!
Gaze upon creation comrades.. Now truly our time has come.. Sathanas... Thy kingdom come!
From this dark and dismal house i have condemned all heavenly hosts.. For thee hounds of Zonei i hand you sacrifice! Maker of kings.. Ancestors of the land..Whose thought is beyond gods and men.. Remember... 

(Of Elder Revisitation)
Released upon the world of men once more.. Cthulu, hearken and remember!
To void the earth of tranquil life once more.. Marduk, hearken and remember! 

At once gazing upon the eyes of old.. Marduk hath seethed with irk and vile contemplation.. Spirit of the moon remember! Enki has risen of dark waters upon men with disease as sin.
As with rays of flaming disk was lashed upon from the heavens removing all fluids and matter of sin as spillage upon the floors of earth as lakes of intestinal excretion... 

I call to thee!
What spirit on earth hath conjured...
Name of the Covenant!
Proceeded of hidden realm retreat...
Watcher of the ways!
Past upon the mighty gate... 

Upon the throne lucifer sits in contemplation of unresurrection
As beasts are these ancient yet elder gods of dimensions past.
They must return from whence they came as spirits exorcized
Fell beasts of unimaginable force.. For they may challenge the throne of mine..
Beasts of burden.. Unconstrained by forces of heavenly nature
Ever watchful those eyes of watching gazing upon mine eyes.. 
Fell beasts of unimaginable force.. For they may challenge the throne of mine.. 
Ever purposeful they awaken from tomes of restraint of hell.... 

(Opus o' Sathanas)
Mother darkness! Wrap your loving arms around me.. 
I have sung of chaos and eternal nights of burning moon
I hath brought hellacaust upon the lands of men and beast 
Raised iniquitous creation of pure sin from earthen tombs..
These hosts of hell with ceaseless cry, the shining crown of night....The depths, the journey and the memory
Remnants of the hate your human lives amount to
The very gasp the moment
You begin(Instrumental)(Eklundh)

They never tell you face to face
They are the one and only race

They always smile and are polite
They go thru life in black and white

They close their eyes and all is bliss
They always scent of prejudice

They cannot spell hypocrisy
They're everywhere; they're you and me

How did we become
Such hateful little people?
How did we become
The scab that we are?

Where's it coming from?
Hateful little people
How did we become
The scab that we are?

I hate you
You hate me
We hate ourselves

How did we become
Such hateful little people?
How did we become
The scab that we are?

Where's it coming from?
Hateful little people
How did we becomeMust we swim on forever?
in search of where the light breaks
pipelines must end somewhere
twenty kicks into the abyss

Must we swim on forever?
in search of where the light breaks
pipelines must end somewhere
twenty kicks into the abyssYou will lick your blood
Off my shit-stained boots
You will never taste
Another again
The smell of leather keeps us together...

You will never sleep
Without the nightmare of me
And you will be dead
Before you can leave
The smell of leather keeps us together....

Organs will be strewn
About as a trail
To where they'll find
Your severed skull

Dreams and dreams
Of a little dead you
Your blues eyes
Thumbed deep within your head

Taste my cum
On your bruised, bleeding lips
A reminder
That I'm not through with you yet

The smell of leather keeps us together
I want to plunge inside your heart...I started writing this song in a graveyard 
because I figured I should get used to being in one. 
I don't really think I want to be cremated 
because I want to leave a mark on the world. 
Isn't that pathetic? (hahaha pitiful pitiful pitiful pitiful pitiful) 
He wants to pay someone to carve his name 
into a rock when he bites it. 
"He wants to leave his mark on the world" 
means he want to leave a dent in the ground 
so you know he's being eaten. 

I'll rip every scar and scab from my body. 
I'll pluck out the tumors I'll poison my self. 
(CALM DOWN) 
I'll cling to machines that cling to life for me. 
I'm so scared of dying it's ruining my health. 
(The king's arrival has not been heralded, despite 
his inevitability, and should the trumpets blow 
tomorrow, he may yet retain you in torturous service 
for aeons.) 

Live a little, kid, you're still not dead. 
Chances are this is all in your head. 
No, it's real, it's real, what else could it be? 
The worst stuff always happens to me 

Come on, everybody! KING CRAB! 
A little bit louder! KING CRAB! 
One more time y'all! KING CRAB! 
KING!

CRAB!Herrezen uit het moeras

ICE SPIDER REELS OFF THE WEBThe same wind that takes you,
The same wind that makes me come through,
but also keeps me alive,
it might to be in life.

The sun is gone ,
strange night ,
I'm here thinking in death, 
and you there, living your life... 

Here, where the wind sings ,
in the same tone of voice,
we sang together.I screamed in pain as Pa
Yanked me up from my chair by my
That was the first time he took me
To the room in the back of the barn
I had to be punished at once

Rancid putrefaction
Overpowering me
Vomiting violently
The place is full - crawling
All over - with maggots

Coming forth from everywhere
From the holes in the viscera

Silent rape of sanity
Wreathed in rot

I realised from the smell
That this would imprint on my soul
He opened up the door and pushed me in
Told me to get down the goddamn floor
Full of reeking entrails

Minutes turn into hours
Paralyzed - drifting into hell
Minutes turn into hours
Not long before they're in my mouth

Afterwards I scrub and scrub
My skin turns red and falls off
I start to bleed all over
Somewhere I'm sure they still cling to me(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Accept the fact that you're second rate, life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal, that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel

Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother?

When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother?
Zero the Hero
Impossibility, impissibolity, mother
Really a Hero

You sit there watch it all burn down, it's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge, no edge, you got no knife have you
Your life is a six-lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast, you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver

What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother?
Zero the Hero
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother?
Zero the Hero
When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother?

You stand there, captain, we all look, you really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your facedown life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around the city
With your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you, sucker, but you really need stuffing

What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother?

Let's some real work done

Everything is changing
No matter what you do
Holler all toy want
We are many against few
Give me no excuses
It's time to make a stand
Choose a side...

Or join the ranks
The ranks of the terrified
Join the ranks
The ranks of the terrified

Your silence derives from fear
Being "neutral" is no option here

Bailing out is not OK
It's too convenient to look the other wayA plague of nostalgia for a fictive past, 
Not merely dead, never born, 
is the most desperate form of escapism. 
Accident of birth, the pride of the insipid. 
Blood still runs, rose-tinted, 
Spilling on the red rock 
In starvation and waste 
In fanfares 
and marches 
and broad arching melody. 
Wastelands ruled by ruined kings. 
Curses never lifted.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)As part of a movie tie-in 
Burger King offered a premium 
A blackened coffin with a child's meal 

You disturb the undead 
You dig up the blackened coffin 
The spirits call it murder 
And will destroy the consumer 

This imagery is beyond you mortals 
Do not taunt these demons 
Who lay rotting in blackened coffins 
Waiting to get evenI'm fucking gone!,
Just when I thought I was alive,
It was all mostly fake,
This..the cause of my demise,

(chorus)
The dark side of the soul,
Again reigns supreme,
Causing death unto hope,
What little hope there was,

What realizations I have?..you ask?,
There's still death of spirit,
Only a little hope, I found,
Maybe I do have a clue,

It's true, maybe there is death now,
But I don't really want to die,
Maybe it's best that I listen,
Pick up all the subtle hints,The shadow in my glass of wine
The face on the lackluster surface
So is this the sign for the changes to come?
This hidden gate to the realm without law?

Unseen movements in reality
Two images in one form
Twins so different so alike
Jus flip the coin to choose your side

Angels aside, let me see the demon
The disguised beast behind the veil
Give me the order for these words
And thoughts that circle my mind

Now i drink the wine and swallow the shadow
Now i take my knife and slash this landscape apart
The source of impressions boils like blood from the wound
And strikes into my soul through my dead heart

The bridge is built and the streams flows
Abstract waves in this microcosm
My boat of nails and oars of ones
Shadows recurin the rivers groovesAbsense of winds, holds are full.

Ready to start the journey of doom.

Day after day no progress in course.

Needs weird rites, extreeme sacrifice.

Bridge:

All along we'll sail in his court.

A price we have to pay for.

A fee of whole folk.

Before the end of the night.

 

Absence of winds, holds are full.

Ready to start the journey of doom.

Day after day no progress in course.

Needs weird rites, extreme sacrifice.

And so the sun is low again

Clear is the sky, no winds for the braves

Bless us father for our journey.

Beautiest daughter  offered For the Nethuns' embrace

Bravest son are offered

Brother of the supreme Lord Permit us to sail  to find out our fatherland

As torch carried by strongest hands.

Leads us to new hills and planes.

Westward to forefathers  home.

All along we'll sail in his court.

A price we have to pay for.

Beautiest daugther  offered For the Nethuns' embrace

Us all!!!Cold winds and burning tears
Blood signs the epitaph
Rejoicing in unholiness
When life ends in great pain

Bleeding in the fields of war
Tasting cold acid blood
Cruel path of the warrior
When life ends in great pain

Blood is the life
In blood we trust
In blood we trust

Crawling embrace with pain
Entrance to eternal oath
The last reflection of my existenceCome little children, take my hand and step into my kingdom 
Fruitless lives, such a minor sacrifice 
End their lives 
Take my hand to paradise 

Once you see my symbols, your eyes gaze upon my countenance 
You have signed a binding covenant 
I shall ever seek to consummate! 

Fruitless lives , such a minor sacrifice 
End their lives 
Take my hand to paradise 

You will not escape and no one ever will 
I am Bughuul, and I will eat until I get my fill 

Fruitless lives such a minor sacrifice 
End their lives 
Take my hand through paradiseThere you stand united
Attack me is your goal
Attack me your words of Jesus
You can never hurt me
or make me change my ways
We will never be the same

It can't be that hard to see
that Jesus means nothing to me
I was never one of his followers
I walk the path of fire

I can feel your presence
You are ready to attack
You see me as a threat against
Jesus Christ, your savior
Your golden fucking lord
I will never drop my guard

It can't be that hard to see
that Jesus means nothing to me
I was never one of his followers
I walk the path of fire

Path of fire
Path of fire
Path of fire
Path of fire
Of fire.

Never - I will never kiss the cross
or get down on my knees to pray
Satan - on your firepath I walk
satisfied with the choices I have made

I despise Jesus
I Despise the church
I walk the path of fire
Burning but unhurt

There you stand united
Attack me is your goal
Attack me your words of Jesus
You can never hurt me
or make me change my ways
We will never be the same

It can't be that hard to see
that Jesus means nothing to me
I was never one of his followers
I walk the path of fire

Path of fire
Path of fire
Path of fire
Path of fire
Of fire.From childhood in mud the inscriptions read
Tracks for miles from rubber hieroglyphs bleed
The ambling loops that are unassociated
In my mind by exhaust
The hub when left long amongst man
If chromed then lost
I'm tired -- so tired
You should have seen me shaped
Like the perfect circle of sun
My bowed back bows only to eternity
And the ground round guns
10 per Mack, 2 per cycle
I've got to mimic my heroes
Running over the ground
Feet work like pensive dung poised to fail
I bow to the commercials of Uniroyal
I'm tired -- so tired.The world where the evil rules
The world where negative is positive
Filth and scum are the icons of purity.
Wasting time searching for feel of security.
Naivity knocked you down
Evil thoughts manipulate you
Life is hard - so fight!
Search where you haven't found anything
negative feelings dimminish your sight.
Life is hard - so fight!
Naivity knocked you down
Evil thoughts manipulate you.
Don't let your surrounding where evil rules to manipulate you
When world is dirty and environs is ill
Stay upright forever
When life is hard - so fight!(Instrumental)Release her body like nectar formed
On Golgotha display the human flesh
Covering the spirits of the carnal dead
Submerged in the blood of a raped form

Tie her body to the wooden cross
To suck the vinegar from the Christ Lord

And baptize the concealed beauty
With vapor decaying viral whore
To sleep in paradise alone

I can't see from this vantage point
That the world is coming to an end
This fucking shit universe left by God for dogs
Is ripping, ripping at our flesh

Let us drink this vile of whiskey
And bury our sorrow with emptiness
The beasts swallow her dying flesh
With no comfort for fucking breath

She rests her head on a paved deathbed
While hallucinogenic visions of a shotgun instead
Sucks the life from the empty preying vessel

I clamber to my feet to aid her escape
The horror surrounds us like the night
It seems no one is left in this place
Except the dead, or the living
Whom set the world ablaze in triumphant sadness

We ready ourselves in a cold sweat
My flesh combines with her flesh
We fuck one another as the only escape

While the dead linger just outside the doorway
My body spasms from the orgasmic flood
And drowns my misery in euphoric nothingness

The zombies break in the fucking house
So many get their brains blown out
I'm all out of ammo so shove a dildo up their
Fucking ass and laugh as I fucking kill myself

She is left on her own but escapes
The attack leaves her heart racing,
Pulsing as she cries to the gods above
"Am I truly left alone?"

Like every good apocalypse
She slits her wrists and slowly drifts
Into the ambient sound waves of night
Where two entwined quietly diedYou and I
Can't deny
A compromise
Between our lives
We never ever thought
Our ways were meant to cross
The weird paths of time
The blue open skies
Blinded by the evil
But we cannot shiver
Through devil's storms
We will find our way

In the darkness
In the light
We're so strong
We will shine so bright
Light the spark of wild desire

In my eyes
You won't find
The truth inside
The words I hide
Cuz there's nothing I could hide
Nothing left to see
I'm just what I seem
Not a sin within a dream
Forced by the evil
To destroy our best
Through our pain
We'll discover our aim

Wait and see our vivid fire of love
Love(Instrumental)Prayers of fools
to christ above
redeeming our, sinful world
nothing but wasted words
fill the nights sky

torment now reigns again
fire of hell stokes akin
deaths breath quenching eternity


Blood shed, by the blind
cross embedded in the knife
holy roman hypocrite
praise the feeble crucifix
declare war in his name
disciples take to arms again
harnessing the jihad of LIES!


spite an disdain
sent forth to me
for i stand alone
godless an empowered

by thy will i fight
not a martyr,not a sacrifice
soul of stone an heart of steel
to no god my rebel soul will kneelSuddenly life turns around
from the blackened interior sky
A race full of empty bounds,
a dream without the old and dark seraphim eye
A trail of forsaken souls

Where the breaths sedate,
Bent the mortal bow (of sins)
A structure of escape
Will set mankind in hate
downfall and pure decay

Who will unlock the lands beyond our death
And who will crush the gate of the chains
Behind the speechless doors dreams watch and break

Creep through the gates
Where comets with fiery trails
Embrace the divinity
Stargazers of life and death
All heavens are sealed
Dwellings near urns
A small vessel in abyss
Thin hands are reaching for the flames
To enlighten (the godsend race)

The seasons do not change for the mass
begotten and blessed are all the sufferers
All the fields lie above the empty world
springing up from tombs and then they fall
and they fall, at the end of the beginning
in a life's palindrome, palindrome
Into the night it chases the fire across the shadows
pointed so far, and wide in life's torch

Under a hyperlogical mental occurence
A truth beyond standardization
Beyond structural representation

As we can see
As we can hear
As we can feel in many ways
Images from distinct classifications

elements of thoughts minus speculations
Bizarre primary definitions
Demand no equivalence
Equipped by senses and imaginations
Systematics cycles of consistency
Individuality within a solid uniformal characteristics

Terrible is our way to the fight
Honour and hate living in harmony

Three coffins and a shield
Symbols of perversity in Muspelheim
Three keys to the fourth victory

There is the force of the race
Warriors of an insane law
I'm the protector of the law
Dogs in satanic orgy, through the essence
Carnage in the temple of jehovah
Servants crushed by the tyrants

Thunders and lust around Loki
Mountains under a funeral mist
Forest baptized for the blood of the swords
Iron weapons, glory and victory
The strong is stronger aloneAbhor the pristine whore
The glowing white eye in my head will not shut

Cease this at once! I am the chosen leper
I falling inward
The internal void swallowing matter, time and space!

I met myself in a shadow and god was sleeping there
I asked for a cure but he could not be woken
So I stabbed at his neck and was absorbed
Now I crawl like an insect
Burrowing into flesh like needles

To the great white eye I saw pass the scalpel
Drain the fluid and bathe yourself
You stink of the virgin.
Your face now in my window
Recoil and jump to fear

Silence!
With despair it walks
You shall be silenced when the fluid fills your lungs
I am the abhorring stench
The flies of his reckoning shall feast upon your slavery

Turn your eye elsewhere
Your pupil churns blood and bone
To the carpet it goes, so I may walk upon graves

I shall banish the kingdom
The kingdom of your moral string
Snapping like sinews of bone
Splintering the eye

Define your encroaching mass
You whore amongst flesh
Flesh of the senile corpse

The whore reeks in her cave
Her sullen white skull
Illuminated like the moon
The eye shuts and I can sleep.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Big tumour full of putrefaction
Nothing abhorent would gross him out
Dirty trick his pride
Betray his priorities
It's a monster filled with absces
It makes me fuckin sickyou are scratching at my door
you want me to let you in
but i just can't pretend
that you aren't my undead friend
flesh is falling off your bones
while you stand in front of me
moaning all through the night
causing a dreadful fright

i know that you just want to be
right by my side but you can't see
that you can't stay
now please go away
i know this world you will not miss
you only long for my warm kiss
you will have to go
'cause I told you so

the gods call to you now
a full life you've had until now
they are calling
don't ignore them
you have served very well
on this world or maybe your hell?
you should not care
about staying here
you should not care
about staying here

slowly the night turns to morn
just so it can be reborn
you lay face on the ground
body's a boney mound
finally your souls at rest
no longer my nightly pest
you look down form the sky
and i sing this mournful cry

i know that you just longed to be
right by my side and now you see
that you can't stay
you are on your way
the memory of your embrace
will keep a smile upon my face
even though your dead
flying high instead

the souls stumble through night
causing loved ones turn on house-lights
it is widespread
nightly undead
i know soon i'll be free
to join you and then i will be
and old body
slowly rotting(Instrumental)Oh my lord,
Protect our children and our wives
Of terrible Northmen rage!
(x2)

Oh, Odin,
Bless my soul and my sword,
Concede me victory
For this battle.

Longships with dragonheads rise from cold fog,
Fear and siege preparation invade little town,
Northmen arrive behind town walls
After a short but a bleeding battle

Church in flames, pillaging!
Slaughter of defenders,
Graveyard profanity!
Catholic religion rape

Mark...Of...Vikings!

Rusty swords of viking,
Transpix warriors of town,
Torches inflame and destroy
All the jerrybuilds.

Church in flames, pillaging!
Slaughter of defenders,
Graveyard profanity!
Catholic religion rape.

Oxidize axes of viking
Behead warriors of the town,
Wind and oceans
Carry flow of blood.

Oh, my lord,
Why did you forsaken us?
We have been defetated by
The Northsmen fury...

Oh, Odin,
Thank you for Victory
Bless my soul and my weapons :
Prepare me to the next battle!...Sekarang dunia ini milik aku.  
Telah aku hapuskan segala bangsa, yang dipanggil 'manusia'.Do we, human beings still have any conscience?
Corporate power has no moral sense:
Its one and only aim's to devour
As much as it can, at anyone's expense

Wrong way
Dead-end
Too late 
To mend

Doesn't it make you wonder 
My fellow plunderers?
We're all going under 
My fellow plunderers

Plunderers of the Earth

The Earth's living systems are all in decline now,
Natural resources are wasted away
And only the message of a sustainable economy
Is what we can convey

Wrong way
Dead-end
Too late 
To mend

Doesn't it make you wonder 
My fellow plunderers?
We're all going under 
My fellow plunderers

Plunderers of the EarthThis is a cry 
To all the ones I'll leave behind 
Hide from your eyes 
The demons that I keep inside 
The darkness grows 
I'm lost in sorrow so alone 
All I have known 
Is forever gone 

Holding on, standing strong 
Sing my final battle song 
One last breath, choke down the rest 
Faltering I must persist 

A hollow man 
Now walks the ground where I stand 
Time's fleeting sands 
Sift away and bring me my end 

Torn 
A man lost in life 
Sees peace in the black 
Of Death's embrace 

Go now 
Your time has run out 

Fear of what's to come 
Overcomes me 
I embrace the end 

Pain reigns as our minds decay 

SOLO: Fischer 
SOLO: SzemanskiSince the cut appeared in me
I've been trying to get more higher
I never tried to heal myself
Cause I never had the time. Never had the fucking time

I was dying for things that made me cool
But now they are not worth a shit
I realize I was a fool
In search of a reason to exist

In my brain a song vomiting lies
We remain the sons of a hidden vice
Searching the lock of a door built in secret in my head.
Eternal decline of life, but doc says it's all right

If getting nowhere is a crime
Then I'm a fucking criminal
So many years have passed me by
Cause I never had the time. Never had the fucking time

Nothing concrete realized
No son through whom I could live on
Totally dehumanized
I'll die forsaken
With nothing done

It's not a scream, nor some tears
Than can change a whole life of shit
And in addition to my fears
I still never have the time
And I'll never have the time

If I had another chance I would be a man
With no remorse
But it seems there is no other past
Just booze, and bad friends and mistakesPermission / is exclusive
Inclusive / but denied
Rules / are exclusive
For which / you're excluded
Listen / you're alone
You're a cog / in their machine
You won't / make a difference
You will never / make a difference(Instrumental)Moon is shining bright,
While I'm thinking of your eyes,
Pictures in my head.
Will you forgive me?

Dancing n the rain
I feel so damn strange,
'Cause I was so blind...
Forgive me mother...
Now I'm walking here,
Living without fear,
I will try to smile
And keep on fighting.

Thinking of your eyes,
Sisters in the sky
Listen to my scream
And let it rain.
I am here all alone,
You are there in a strange dimension.
I feel like a child, trying to smile,
Still I'm caught in your cry

I am here all alone,
You are there in a strange dimension.
I feel like a child, trying to smile,
Still I'm caught in your cryhellish darkness ripping the lights
havoc strikes the holy land
centuries of christian reign
time has come to bring the pain

corpus christii...

punishment of the flesh
suppression of the weak soul
gloria satanas
slay down the human bastards
sacrifices their souls

screams of endless torture
filling the night of slaughter
hands are painted with christian blood
christian torso slain in mud

unholy sabbath
drink the blood of christ
break the flesh of jehova
crucify the human slaveI'm hearing voices in my head
Telling me to do things
That I would never purposely do
I've been sitting here thinking to myself
Isolating myself from the rest of the world
Now these voices are driving me insane
Getting in my head and telling me what to do
But I will never let them get to me
I'd rather burn in hell for eternity

I need to find some solace
I need to find some peace of mind
I need to find my tranquility
And find a way to escape my head

I am far beyond driven
I can't turn back anymore
The voices are eating me alive
Their one desire is to kill me

Now I keep thinking to myself
What should I do?
With the noose hanging from the ceiling
Should I go and end it all right now?
Or should I stay and live in this hell?

I need to find some solace?
I need to find some peace of mind?
I need to find my tranquility 
And find a way to escape my head

I leave this world behindI wypierdalaj!I see so much, Burns my eyes
Lift your arms up, Touch the sky

I feel so much, Feel like noone
Lift your arms up, Touch the skyAre we so feeble? Are we so low?
Do we believe all the crap we are taught?
They're playing the kings: shall we play
The scum?
Accepting the lowest. The worst is to come

We dare to think another way
No place for men like us
In their world of true lies
Africa dies from hunger, aids and civil war
It's the fate of billions of men they
consciously underwrite

No desire - No inner fire - Life denial
- A total withdrawal

They decide what is right, what is wrong,
Who to pray
But we do not submit to their laws, to their rules,
To their standards.
They know we are the last hard core of freethinking
And they fear the network that's slowly spreading
Underground

Searching for more you are getting the least
And the least is the more you will ever get

Resist and think by yourselfThe best way
You'll see no light
Contradiction
You gonna find
In your life ahead

And it's too much faith
It's like you're fallen
But I know that maybe
You gonna gime me something

Let it go
By the smile on your face
We can see much hunger today

Attitude you'll compromise
In your life ahead
And you'll see my hunger

Hey! What are you felling inside?
I am looking for the time that brings back my life
Come step on the floor and use the higher you know
And for my brothers out there man, I say!

Too much life to go
Past is boll shit
So now the fear is far
To my self

Close all the door you've passed by
To now a mothafucker will stay alive
Leave all the thing that will bug
But now you're poser!They are the beings from the skies
Masters of demise
Learned by the Ancient prophecies

Bannished from this plane
Their voices call to pain
Holders of the key to existence
I am the ONE!!!!!!!!!

They speak... through me
I call... through me
Forgotten voices... From the past
Elder gods... I beckon into me!
With all your Strength
Surround me... Ancient ones!
I hear your power
As i have said!

Demon in me... Redeem your past upon Reflection!
Come through me... Manifest your dreams of chaos!
I beg of you!
Grasp my creation... Overtake my body, command my soul!

These rays of light have blinded my soul!
Abridge the gate between our realms!
I feel your outworld vibrations in me!
Praise thy strength my eternal daemons!
I surrender myself to you my elder fathers!
We shall raise the everlasting underword!
Raise the black seas to overwhelm force!
Conquer this land and claim the throne!

The infernal power flows within my blood
Magnifigence... i grip the eternal strength
Underworld demons have captured my soul
They speak to me... i hear their commands!

My hands spout infernal fire! I spout tongues of unknown dialect?
I levitate above the ground. My eyes glow with the power of infernal fire!

Grasp the unknown force in flame of the power of Magnificence
Realms of truth found within the unholy power
Lifting through the ages an immortal sumerian deamon untold
Defied by its life and held by the sacred oath

Fire in my soul! The flame of life.. The daemon takes hold!
Malificent daemon in me i command you! Surrender to me...

Infernal fire the deamon takes hold and breaks through control
I command thy daemon speak tell me thy name infernal majesty

I am the one who you called.. beckoned forth in to you...
Know me by this.. I am all your fears unleashed.

Infernal fire the deamon takes hold and breaks through control
I command thy daemon speak tell me thy name infernal majesty

Insence of the power the destruction of our..
Desent through the land in praises of man..
Tell me thy name daemon of all i have slain..
Ethereal journey to a plane i wish not to see..

What unholy place is this?!?!

The fires of Hell!!!

I succumb to your power daemon..
Tell me thy name and i will sustain my will to defeat you
Will you hearken forth your powers.. Destroy all i see on the godless earthly realm and claim It as your own and claim it as your throne..
Speak to my thy name of thee who would conquer..
And Destroy my home on this realm

The name you seek.. Is that you cannot speak...

On this plane you called my name and call me too you broken through you
This is the choice you have made you have called my name for pain and pain
I shalt bring you and this plane you call home i will destroy!!!

Vermis Mysteriis is thy name..
The daemon spoke and called infernal torches of malificent flame,
burning all in the fires of hell..
In the hell i called into then flames of all!!

I have forsaken you
Death has overtaken you
Burning internal pain
Once more the earthen realm i have overtaken and claimed for Hell

Fall from the Light.....I see a hundred million faces
and they stare right inside my brain
And what they see is
a man who knows too well what fate is
And they star right inside my soul

All that makes no sense to me
Visions calling, deep inside my head

We live and learn to how to give
our lives to find the spirit inside
I don't wanna see us going under
and I will try to find, my own light

I really had my share of darkness
cause I took each and every pill
to get knocked out
I could not tell what's wrong or right then
No vision's clear enough to take

Runnin'
Hidin'
Always someone after me
Scared and lonely, heaven set me free

We live and learn to how to give
our lives to find the spirit inside
I don't wanna see us going under
and I will try to find, my own lightStart a war in the name of god
Here is your deity
Claim your salvation
Throw it away
Pray to your masters to rain down holy fireI can smell the cancer
Spreading through the universe
Swallowing black holes and supernovas
Spreading all the particles farther apart
Staring down the crossroads
Will we burn or freeze to death
The callous pagan Gods
Will use us again
For their own amusement
Sinking deeper
Everything is decaying
Jumping off a cliff
Into absolute zero
All the parallel dimensions
Have flickered out
There is no place to go
In this stagnant space-time
Sitting here behind this crystal wall
I remember the pristine conditions
Of the ecosystem
I also see
Visions of civilizations
Wiped out by nuclear warfare
So now you have your answer
We are aloneWandering...
Searching for the wind
Whispers in my ear
Of past promises
As old as the trees 

Dieing
Autumn breeze
Beneath my skin
A pillar of stone
Etched sorrows
Patterns in the leaves 

Returning
I see you clearly
As the night
Ethereal Twilight
Illuminates the fire
Burning the sun

Leaving
The dawn haunts the ghost
A faint calling
I cannot return
For I am wandering foreverGot demon's chills 
Though it's hot as Hell 
Should've ignored Pepe's coupon 
Should've stuck to Taco Bell 

Pepe Gonzalez cooked up some bad food 
Pepe Gonzalez didn't wash the dishes 
Pepe Gonzalez didn't check the date on the sour cream 
These homey little businesses are not what they seem 

Should have heeded the warning 
Posted by the county on the door 
I've been throwing up all morning 
My stomach muscles are soreFlashing lights
Unearthly rhythms
Convulsed in heat
Of the erotic overkill
Virginity sacrificed
On the altars of desire
Witching laughter sorrounds
The orgy of fire
Flames make dancing shadows
It's the heartbeat not the though
Trance inducing tempo
Drives you to the streets of babylon
To dungeons of the original sin
Never understimate
The energy of sexual being
All senses opened
Shivers run through the believingBullshit, bullshit, stupid bullshit
sounds every day.
A fucking, fucking stink smells
everywhere.
Wake up, oh wake up! It isn't too late now.
For your disablement will soon be 
your death.

Spit tablesin a dirty pub
full ash-trays and your stench.
On the same chair every day.
A lot of plans and ideas
only among the words.

...And days, weeks like years
are running away.
A tergiversations are your acts
it's the acme of your existence.

Move you lazy bum from the pub.
Change your empty life.
You are a hero only in the dive.
You are a big-mouth corpse.
Big-mouth corpses. They are for shit
the losers from a pubs are dying alive.As humans appear
just as the stars doth glow
they explore the world
from the blazing sun,
to the crescent moon.
In light unflickering,
these people start to grow.
Inventing things,
creating as though it was their last day on the earth
Mountainsides tower before them
lurking with shadows reaching so far.
Obscuring the way to the future,
they bring their own light and they break through.
endless ocean,
skylit harmony
that the humans reach to grasp
Venturing deeper into this new world,
crafting thine tools, turning the ground
Claiming the stars and lighting cigars
this race has endless potential.
Then..
Holding tight,
earning the right,
learning to fight,
bleeding light,
showing their right,
conquering flight,
reaching new height.
Learning. Creating. Genius.
Understanding,
humanity will see the end of time
and rebirth creation.Rock, roll, don't, stop the.... I'm wasted all the time, on smack or coke or weed; I can't control my mind, but I don't care life's a breeze; I've got a gig tonight, but I forgot the words; and I can't find the place, I'm so fucked up it's absurd; The band is mad at me, the reasons I don't know; but they won't fire me, 'coz I'm the star of the show; I need some teenage chick, to come suck on my dick; there's one in every town, helps me get by through this shit; I'm a big rock and roll star, don't give a fuck who you are; I'm a big rock and roll star, I know that I will go far; Rock, roll, don't, stop the....I'll never rock a show, without appearance fee; no garuntees I'll show, only when the mood takes me; I've got a girl back home, but I don't respect her; I fuck the fans I can, girl after girl it's a blur; I want a tragic death, I want the world to cry; maybe an overdose, or a shotgun suicide; and if I die a star, my record sales will climb; a great career move, more rich in death than in life;  I'm a big rock and roll star, don't give a fuck who you are; I'm a big rock and roll star, I know that I will go far.My hate has never gone
Divulge a distrust to you
Plenary overcharges
Killing all which can't be saved
Come like surprise
Trying to scan opposites
Against delusions
The real mistery of my mind

Struggle with aggression
The shadows of freedom
Loaded obsession
My battle of weakness
Lays down dispirited
Excuses of solitude

Hunt of the truth
Entices I need to join
Lost of disarray
A call to sleepless divinity

Struggle with agression
The shadows of freedom
Loaded obsession
My battle of weakness
Lays down dispirited
Excuses of solitude

Next to necromancers breath
Escape, my victory
Staring above my innerself
Suicidal solution

Making me laugh
Penetrate a hundred of plans
Trip into mystery
Entrance to pregnancy

Struggle with agression
The shadows of freedom
Loaded obsession
My battle of weakness
Lays down dispirited
Excuses of solitude

Next to necromancers breath
Escape, my victory
Staring above my innerself
Suicidal solution
Next to necromancers breath
Escape, my victory
Staring above my innerself
Suicidal solutionMany years in misery
Decline of all family
Suffering in burning flames
Hopeless life like homeless

The liar, cheater, thief and bastard
Dadokism hyenaism
So friendly beast without the heart
Dadokism hyenaism
He wants to devastate your life
Dadokism hyenaism
He will throw you into hell(Instrumental)Another night, another life 
Deranged statues begins to take form
When I visit my dreamscape once more
What will I learn this time around in my head 
Colors never seen to man starts to paint
A structure of my inner thoughts

Inside my dreamscape I can unleash my true form
This is the true art of the human spirit
My inner mayhem controls my dreams
So I can survive the daily routine

The black gate is now in front of me
And I know what lurks behind it
On a fire bed I lay
Eternally bleeding from wounds no one can see
The purgatory afterglow keeps me aware
Of all my weaknesses and mistakes

Inside my dreamscape I can unleash my true form
This is the true art of the human spirit
My inner mayhem controls my dreams
So I can survive the daily routine

I continue through the gate into the core
I walk inside my own desire
Meeting the mistress who took it all away
she still pierce my heart with her words
My hate takes me away beyond sanity
And like an assasin I stab my guilt in the back

The blood in front of me gives me a new vision
I see the moon hiding behind stormy clouds
As my inner light awakens my filthy fantasy
I grab this world in my hand and crush it
And take my life to create
A universe free from hesitation and betrayal

Inside my dreamscape I can unleash my true form
This is the true art of the human spirit
My inner mayhem controls my dreams
So I can survive the daily routineCircuits aligned 
Commands compiled 

Static disposition 
Now overturned 

Yearning for an input 
From bestial hoards 

Ceilings of chaos 
Ruptured by airfoils 

Past the gallery 
Blinking eyes 

Cockpit illuminated 
Motioned to approach 

Not by a human, but by circuitry - 
The new veins of the world 

Curious instruments 
Emerging from panels 
Curious instruments 
Electric contrails 
Curious instruments 
Time to engulf me 
Curious instruments 
Adopt my thirst 

The glimmer in your eyes 
Ready to take the second stride 
In those all-consuming eyes 
The hypnotic appeal of integrated wires 

Crashing to the floor of the cockpit 
Contemplating, dilating 
Absolute altitude of cognition 
Selected for integration 

Curious instruments 
Emerging from panels 
Curious instruments 
Electric contrails 
Curious instruments 
Time to engulf me 
Curious instruments 
Adopt my thirst 

The glimmer in your eyes 
Ready to take the second stride 
Those all-consuming eyes 
Discerning angles of attack 

Crashing to the floor of the cockpit 
Contemplating, dilating 
Absolute altitude of cognition 
Howls course through combing 

Clinging tightly to our robes 
Not willing to let go 
Dancing softly around our lobes 
An appeal resonates - 
Get me off this vessel! 

Descending onto the tarmac 
Accompanied 
Blinking eyes focusing 
On the openingWe're far enough, unsheathe your blade. Ripples and waves as the man is let free. 
It all ends with a sigh. 

And then time took it all back.In solitude and darkness he is taken. The light flickers upon a shadow in front of him. It does not speak, it does not bend, and slowly moves closer. 

Just before a glove covers his mouth he lets out a scream of fear, growing ever distant in the night, but the trees stand guard and keeps it from finding a saviour. 
The footsteps of the devil are almost all that is heard, and a light scraping of his prey follow into the void. Scraping, steps, dirt, and dust.Call the storm, 
thunder and lightning shall mark my revenge
Rain shall fall 
washing away the debris of the past

Entering a new millennium
of pain of war of suffering
of terror of darkness of hatred
of madness of carnage of bloodshed
this tempestost world will shatter and die

Into the apocalypse we fall - angels of agony dancing defeat
Into the apocalypse we fall - the threads are torn, lost and gone

Crown of thorns 
worn with pride throughout all the pain
Lightning strikes, 
illuminating judgement done

This world is lost
It's falling to pieces
In my hands

Entering a new millennium...

Into the apocalypse we fall...

Call the storm, 
thunder and lightning shall mark the rebirth
Pouring rain 
wreaking wrath from heavens above
Tear the shroud, 
cleanse the face of the earth of debris
Then await 
A new millennium the dawn of the lightUnder the weight of our world even hell must collapse, and with shouting and screaming not one demon lasts. 
The running steps of madmen aflame as their reason relapses unto crumbling minds. And there you find hope, among the desperate few men. 
You gather the air and let go a muffled scream. With feet on the soil, scraping and hurting. Your soul seems revived and crawling for mercy. 
You struggle and pull every limb, every muscle. But the rope still holds, you do nothing but shuffle. 
And then the world is torn apart.(Instrumental)Old sea captain warned us today
When the lord surely looked the other way
Something in the stream outside of town
Reached up and dragged my poor child down

[Chorus]
Has the devil caused this hellish heat
To lure our children down to the creek
Eleven miles from the nearest waves
What manner of beast has swam in from the bay

Young man dive in with hopes to free
My boy's body from the jaws of the thing
At the deepest part of the swimming hole
Refuses to give back the life it stole

[Chorus]

Bring your guns and dynamite
The monster in the creek dies tonight
Fire at whatever moves within the muddy waters of Matawan
Life fuses tossed deep
We'll blow the demon right out of the stream

[Chorus]Have you seen your face in the firelight?
The way it contorts every smile
And writhes before your eyes
Waiting to swallow you alive

We wear a tourniquet of shadows
To cease the flow from our hearts
Praise Icons with trembling hands
Until we mimic their lives

The incence burns my poor lungs/
As the puppet becomes unstrung
I have bled my share into the snow/
Even the sun is growing cold

The roaches nest in our home
I don't think we are welcome anymore
It is time to let the bonfires
Lead us into the thirsting night

And what of the rodent speech?
Grooming us until the bitter end
Lulling us into a fitful sleep
As we try to comprehend
Why we are kept inside
Staring at the conflagration
Or left to drift through life
All alone in our stagnation

The roaches nest in our home...

I will stay where I have always been
please don't leave without me

I don't know where I am supposed to go
I don't know where I am supposed to be
I will stay where I have always been
Please don't leave without meA gentle glow 
Though not warming my face 
And so life slows 
Drips away without a trace 
I could be doing so much more 
But I'm reviewing airport floors 

And so hours pass and go 
And what I want to finish has not showed 
And still you're sitting with me 
Still sending pictures of fleas 

Send it to its grave 
My God you've never changed 
Pictures of your food 
I've never craved 

Read my blog 
Its about my colon 
I do not have one 
And ain't it great 

And night descends upon the room 
And within the dark and murky gloom 
Comes a man with a gaping wound 
And comes a face with a threatening tune 

Look at my cat 
Look at my cat 
Ain't it wonderful 
Ain't it wonderful 
Don't you wish you had a cat like mine 
Don't you wish you had a cat like mine 

And so hours pass and go 
And what I want to finish has not showed 
And still you're sitting with me 
Still sending pictures of fleas 

Send it to its grave 
My God you've never changed 
Pictures of your food 
I've never craved 
I don't need to know 
What you are eating 
Still I look at it 
I should be sleeping 

Have you seen this 
You need to see this 
Please see this 
Satisfy me 

And night descends upon the room 
And within the dark and murky gloom 
Comes a man with a gaping wound 
And comes a face with a threatening tune 

Look at my face look at my face 
Ain't I random 
Ain't I alternative 
Look at my face from a different angle 
Aren't I fucking wonderful 

And so hours pass and go 
And what I want to finish has not showed 
And still you're sitting with me 
Still sending pictures of fleas 

Send it to its grave 
My God you've never changed 
Pictures of your food 
I've never craved 
I don't need to know 
What you are eating 
Still I look at it 
I should be sleeping 

Oh it's so cool 
You should try it too 
Why be productive when you could be on the internet 
Oh it's so cool 
You should try it too 
Why be productive when you could be on the internet 

And so the internet generation descended into the depths of the intellectual void, culture in favour of grainy photos of their pesto-drenched vegan enchiladas sepia selfies and independent coffee shops

He who was spat upon,
He whose face was marred beyond all human likeness.
Somewhere buried amongst the lies of the past
Rests the tomb of Yeshua,
Of he who was made God in a world without hope.

What then will the Church of Rome say?
Prepare yourselves for the day is coming,

Lift your arms up, Touch the sky

I feel so much, Feel like no one
Lift your arms up, Touch the sky(Instrumental)Back to your own past
Indifferently and egoistic wishes
The mass moves itself in the direction of the welfare
Follow your honour leader

Decompose the genetically coded instincts
Steal the bonfire of human sagacity
Lost in own sediment
Optimistic looks and answers(Instrumental)New night, new chick to me you're just a toy
the smell of yesterdays fun Is still grabbing the wall
I don't do coke, I don't do smack
Women are my ultimate high to bad I always forget

I lurk in the corner I'm spotting you out
now that you're aware of me, Come-on let me set you free
This is what I live for night after night
I know I have won when I have you in sight

Here I am again, looking for my prey
Here I am to please again
Here I am again I don't want you to stay
Here I am again

We are the iniquitous children born of Earth
We are standing at the foundations of Chaos
Know that man was spawned from the blood of Kingu
Commander to the hordes of the dreadful Ancient ones
And know now that man does possess his baneful spirit
This the cold seed of rebellion against those Elder gods
And blood of man is the blood of vengeance
And blood of man is the spirit of vengeance
And power of man is power of the Ancients
And let it be known that this is the covenant
Know that man holds the sign, the shape and the number
By which he may summon the stale blood of his parents
And know that this is the covenant created by Elder gods
Man is the key in which the gate may be again flung wide
Such as man is the key
By which the ancient ones 
may seek their vengeance
Upon the mighty Cthulhu
Whom lies between worlds
And does truely call death
To those in realm of men
As they are keys of demise

- Of Cephalomancy and Mystic Etchings - 8:25

As Marduk lies.. Dreaming
A vision of chaos..
Filled with dread.. Fear
Awaken to see.. Dreams
Cthulhu lying upon bodies of men
Upon time to cross..
Saw burning.. Gods
Upon corpse of Tiamat
Sixty times water of life
As she may call to Ancient gods
Hearken Tiamat! and know as i speak this unto you i am he whom hath restored 
your life. Go forth unto your Ancient bretherin and speak unto them i have seen 
their faces in death. With all powers of Cephalomancy i have conjured visions 
of the futre and it is one of unlife. Know that the mighty Cthulhu shall consume all
and all shall be as dead but not dreaming. Tiamat did rear up upon the body of 
Marduk and she did become as smoke unto winds. Marduk did begin his journey 
upon the realm of men and did become as man himself. Between space he flew 
as light between stars unto the sphere of Kia he did become. And so he did set 
out among men to find the key to the gates of baneful mighty Cthulhu
Over worlds
Between spaces
Across lands
Through seas
And one man shall be the salvation of our kind and of their own kind for he is 
the key. Yet upon the woods i do find this ecclesiastic soul whom holds the 
sacred keys of sorcery. Awakening of our souls yields a name a shape and a 
number by which the gate may open. Upon throes of maelstrom a binding of 
light to the sigil of Cthulhu known as a sign of chaos
Through seas
Across lands
Between spaces
Over worlds
Where upon the thrones of Tiamat i did stoop and beside me the key of man did 
kneel down. With a baneful howl the body of tiamat did rear upon the key and he 
did stand fast and strong. Marduk you have come to me once more with a one 
from races of men so tell me of visions. And with that the Ancient ones surrounded 
our bodies and we did call out to the death of Cthulhu
Over worlds
Between spaces
Across lands
Through seas
Beyond the wanderers of night they rose yet past the winged elementals, before 
dimensional manifestations, beyond the ethereal vortex, past fallen ruins of Kia, 
and through gates of astral frost they journeyed. And it was known to them that 
this one of men would be the key to life. And Kingu did summon weapons with 
no equal of power that they may do battle against this Ancient god of rebellion and 
lies. For it was known that a magnificent battle was upon them.
Whence upon the first gate they did arrive they did kneel
and they did call to the watcher for strength.

- The Burning Disks of Unlife - 0:87

Before the first gate the key did stand, summoning a whirlwind of force he opened 
the gate. Beyond a dormant corridor lies faces of monsters
Under path of Cthulhu they follow and they howl
Let us make bones of bodies, heaps of their flesh
A battle ensued of a great time and of destruction
Yet as all became clear
Those of Marduk standing
Masses of gravaged bones
Piles of that decaying flesh
Upon the gate of two the did stum with the blood of monsters upon their faces
Let any whom dare satnd before us hearken forth now lest i summon demons
That they may do battle against any whom do stand in shadows of loathing fear
Before us stand and make yourself known to me lest i summon those demons
Shadows did appear as one and did stand before those of Marduk and of Tiamat
Before sound or light the shadows lashed with disks of blackness and of death
It was known that the head of Ishtar did fall upon ground as death shrouded her
Marduk cried out with spears of fire upon the spirit and blew an evil wind upon it

- Demons of the Wanderings - 1:09

Enraged.. with emotion
Upon her corpse.. a sword
In spaces.. between spaces
We hid her body as laid to rest
Upon .. gate of three
We stood.. and it opened
Passed.. as would be
At gate of four we stood before
He of men stood before the gate of four
Lord Shammash upon unto me your gate
By name of Uddu i beg of you open to me
Lest i break apart its barriers with forces
With a blinding light the gate did open wide
Revealing unto all a beast of dark wanderings
And it did rise upon he of men with sorcery
Yet Marduk did summon winds of bane into it
As the Akhkharu reared upon its sepentine belly
It raised upon Marduk with an evil emotion
Edin na zu! Edin na zu! Destroyer of worlds!
Binding in fear and clasped upon hands of stars
Arise! Go far away! Be shamed! Flee! Turn away from my body!
Go to the desert! I command thee! In name of shammash
Go to the desert! Not to rise before me once more
Be commanded by Shammash the mighty
Be commanded by gods of magick, your destroyer!
Kakkammu Kanpa Barra Homme!

- The Battle of all Endings - 4:20

Yet in realms of Cthulu he did grow weary of such battles
And did cast spells of opening upon those remaining gates
Called.. from past
As day turned unto darkness marduk did draw ever near
As Cthulhu reared upon his throne with a baneful howl
Stand.. before me
Marduk did enter upon the realm of Cthulhu with caution
Cthulhu did close the final gate before others may have entered
Now.. your death
Marduk lept fourth upon cthulhu with spears of demon spawn
As Cthulhu lunged with howls of demonic monster serpents
Who.. shall fall
With a flame and howl of calling
Marduk fell with wounds of death
With spears and howls of calling 
Cthulhu fell with wounds of death
Marduk undead nor dreaming
Staring eyes of the others death 
Cthulhu undead nor dreaming
Staring unto the eyes of death
Hearken Cthulhu and hear me as i speak unto you
You have called us forth for your death as known
What spirits of iniquity did fill your soul with treachery
It is upon you i lay my sword for it is your fates that call
Cthulhu did become filled with fires of strength and sorcery
As Marduk lay upon ground he did become pale with fear
With an enraged yell Cthulhu did beckon all forces of Uggae
For now it would be the magician who would lye dreaming
Be known elder god your fates are howling death and dreams
One shall fall in as death and all shall be known of his loss
As Cthulhu lay the blade of Marduk's sword upon his body
And with a swift motion the corpse of Marduk lay without head
Storms of black rain fell upon the land and the final gate opened
Once more mighty Tiamat stared upon Cthulhu and saw the corpse
The last thing Tiamat did see as Cthulhu did rendered her lifeless
And many would stand before Cthulhu and all would be as death
Yet one stood upon the throne of Cthulhu with sword of Marduk
And as Cthulhu did sense a presence he saw his enemies face
As the blade did carve out upon the throat of the mighty serpent
Lifeless Cthulhu fell upon the corpse of Tiamat, headless and dreaming

- Markings of Chaos - 6:66

Stoop not down...
Unto a darkened abyss..
Realms of death..
Of darkened waters..
A wind has risen! Dark waters stir! Signs of Chaos!We are all longing for
The missing element
We are all in quest of
The missing elementAs I stumble out of the ruins covered in flesh-dust, dripping with brain-fluid, tripping over decapitated heads...One is for feeling, One is for death 
One is for grasping to my final breath 
You will be my angry side 
You will be my cry 
rise above my intellect to bleed this soul dry 

Close my eyes to see 
It's all so very clear 
My multiple personalities 
And I'm the only one to fear(Instrumental)Enemy battleships lost in the fog
Firing blindly into the endless deep
The clouds are burning
Another great disappointment
The infantile longing for death unveiled
Consciousness is nature's nightmare
History is our own
And from it we awaken one last time
Rotten grain spilling from our bodies
Dying without even once having loved
something more than ourselves
The inalienable right of a billion eternally-newborn kings
The suicidal pleasure of the human alone
Stranded in the solipsist's temple
Ours is the heritage of free men
Free of all power and meaning
Free of everything at lastThe god comes, the god comes 
The earth trembles in fear 
The god comes, the god comes 
Tremble in fear at the coming of Ogdy 

The god comes, the god comes 
The earth rises and falls
The god comes, the god comes 
Rises and falls beneath my feet 

My place of purification 
Is over thrown 
Place of purification 
My lodge poles topple 

Blinding bright 
His tongue lashes at the sky 
His roar booms off the hill 
Ogdy is calling his avatar from the underworld 

Heading the god's call 
The avatar arises 
Spawn of darkness 
From the underworld, he rises 

Insatiable, all devouring 
Like wild wolves 
Tearing at the entrails of their kill 
The avatar arises now!(Instrumental)Welcome to corpuscular world
 Philosophy of alternative mentality
 Demons ewoke scintifical sights
 And sound the deep of normality
 Welcome to the muscular minds
 Land of fisical reality
 Angels summon different kinds
 Of proportional morbidity
 Pervetive brains pulsating and tremoring
 Because one want to womit perpetual spring
 Of spiritual healing arts of sciens
 Play the frienzeed rendering
 Corpuscular theory about a soul and minds
 Philosophic equilibrium didn't find
 Demons and angels show different kinds
 Of arachnoidical sights
 Sciens is a future
 Sciens is a rapture
 Sick brain of madman is twiligts
 Nobody can't find its mind
 Fight between madness an policy
 Born in the scientifical sigtsCrucify me upon the cross of suffering
Punish me for all my sins
Crucify me upon the cross of your divinity
I must die in pain to find rebirth, within

Let nails be pierced through my ands and feet
So that if I bow before weakness, I'll suffocate
Give me a crown of thorns, which agonizes my forehead
But let in also be a crown of your glory, so great

And let me not hang before scorn, nor pity
But only for your judgements eyes
And let me in the shadow of your supremacy
Become your blackened christ

Let me not die for the sins of a thousand 
But only for those of my own
But still my suffering shall be one thousand times greater
Than of the holy lord

But still I shall not scream in agony
And say, "Lord, why have thou forsaken me"
A son of Satan, nailed to a crucifix
Through the eyes of his black divinityTelevisions, breaking news popped out that night:
another explosion's attacked the city again.
Hospitals were filled with innocent victims,
death tolls are high, but none would down in fear.

Mean attraction, horror in sight,
spreading the terrors, to kill was not the mission.
But yet only death appears at the frontline.
What lies ahead, a situational chaos?
How far they've succeded, none exactly knows.

Mean attraction, terror in sight,
human, the only species
with mass-murder capability.
Seething with disconcent,
political visions to obscure resolutions.
What reasons that stimulate madness
out of these poor brains?
Purpose never reached, when all become a part
of business as usual.a species with humble specifications
fueled by spirit
movements within the conscienceless
act upon processes which depletes negativity
a copious sensation contained
poisons of life (they) trickle through
un-oxidated cells, empty veins
as marred constants.
"stvari" paragraph states,
things will never change.Ceiling swings over nonexistent
Skin becomes inflamed
Shortcut narrows a distance stays
Absence from this meaning
Seems to suck out the liquid thoughts
Rain irrigates the words
Hollow ground my escape and safe
Must be disagreeable

How low they could flow
One deeper level on an unspoiled hole
Face behind the attack
Of isolated, selfish and me

Looking still into sentenced mind
Does it know how to care
Guest of honour has a slave's disgrace
Captivity of fame

Tears fall from their eyes
Ordinary things are superficial fakes
Celebrating above my talent
Was it good enough to be my tale

Stains of my grave
Still remain
I'm the one
In this room

Sinking breath totally gone low
Disconnected dawn
Pretending they were insane with dreams
Only lies were in time

How low they could flow
One deeper level on an unspoiled hole
Face behind the attack
Of isolated, selfish and me

Stains of my grave
Still remain
I'm the one
In this room
To give my
Approval of
Indifference
I gave you something real

Stains
Of my grave
Still remain

bright lights in blurry streets... fuzzy and flashing before my eyes
overwhelmed - intense paranoia...

death i cannot see
life means nothing to me
striving to escape
open my eyes - there's a vision of Hell...

and when i die nobody will have known the real me... not even me...

something inside wants me to be empty, void of substance...

stomach turning, heart is aching, body shaking!
head feels like it weighs a tonne
weakness takes control
all pain without death...

internal torture, the only way to handle
the only way to destroy yourself
the never-ending cycle - self-inflicted...
WON'T STOP TIL I'M COMPLETELY GONE...........................i swallow the sun
i`m from the beginning of time
now all hope is gone
there'll never be another dawn

it has begun
what have we done
he swallows the sun
he's eating the dawn

sun eater

now thats the revange
i'll everything change to my favour
and your light will fade
no mercy. now it is too late

you've done things that were not justified
you did not care that my children died
i prayed, asked you so many times
you gave no heed to my suffering...now you lost!

so die! i'll simply crush you
die! i'll swallow the whole sun
die! i will destroy you
so die! you've forfeited your life

IT WASN'T STORM WHICH PRODUCES FEAR
AND YOU PERMITTED TO SEIZE YOURSELF
UTTERLY STRANGE MAGIC WAS COMING
YOU'RE DANCING WITH IMPOSING NOTE NOW

WHERE IS KEY ? WHERE IS DOOR ?
FOOL WHERE IS YOUR CONSIDERATION
YOU LOST FATE AT OWN REQUEST
YOU SOLD FREEDOM FOR SO PALTRY MONEY
YOU FOOL

IT'S HARD TO FIND THAT AWARDNESS NOW
IT'S NO MERCY FOR SUCH MADMEN
YOU'VE TAKEN RASH DECISION OF REBEL
EAT OWN FEELINGS TREND SOSWEET OUTSIDE
TASTE BITTERNESS SWEET FOR YESTERDAY
FALL ON KNEES AND BEG FORGIVENESS(Instrumental)In the blindness of our time
We are still alive
Miracles will shine so bright
If we pay the price

Love with all your heart
Just be yourself and make it last forever
Win the game and start to fuel the spark

In the words I hide
Will your soul reside
In the past you lied
Why I can't decide

In this everlasting way
We just deal with the pain
We could heal minds and souls
Or we could just end up to war

Time to take the risk
And start to grow without a single thought
Time to put away the past and roam

Make the future change while you can
Cuz you're still on time
Take a rest but don't forget to test
Your lessons learned

The words I hide
In the past you lied
Why, I can't, decide, yes why, I can't decide(Instrumental)In the name of the Holy See, CFR, BC, FED...
Nations're led into misery - in secrecy
From a global conspiracy into a new age of tyranny
Our brave new slavery will soon reveal

Tyrants of the world
In dark conspiracy
Behind the scenery
The truth lies concealed

Abolition of democracy
Human rights and liberty
To establish a (global) surveillance state
Freedom's at stake
False flag terror justifies new wars
Nations mashed by iron claws
Financial crises and a new disease
Make you believe (their lies)

Masters of deceit
Altered reality
Behind the scenery
The truth lies concealed

A fascist regime based on debt slavery, blind faith, hate and fear...
Mondial Mastery!!!

(United) under a global governmind
A prison planet for mankind
Human life-stock for the world's elite
Obedient sheep
Follow the followers towards your graves
Otherwise you'd fall from grace
Overthrow the System that has made us slaves
WE (the people shall) seal their fate!!!

Tyrants of the world
In dark conspiracy
Masters of deceit
The truth lies concealedOpen!
Open the door
Come back
It's your turn
What's the prince?
What do I have to pay?
For you!

You destroyed my life
You destroyed my friend ship
You destroyed the world
My world
I am across with you
Avoid!

I don't understand!if I die in the shade of moonlight...
or in my old house I fall from exhaustion...
leave me in peace, I want to rest
I want nothing more to none of you
I will die, and leave melodies
drawn on crooked lines
I tried to straighten out...
vainly...
What a beautiful eternity feelings dead
for the slow tortures of expression

When I die, I will take with me
the cold dawns and sunsets
and the sad feeling coming from not knowing where I will be...Rise, from the internal torments
Rise from pain and agony
Rise from your mind

Dive, off the eternal darkness
Dive in bliss and energy
Dive in pure light

Change, rebuild the frame of mind
Break the past with fury
Stand aloofBurning, within me 
The flaming, will to be 
Ahead of, this consuming aching 
Breathing, the pain is 
The only,way to see 
The real and the unreality 

An illusion this never ending maze 
A hallucination, found in a perfect circle 
I know reality, caught in the same old cycle 
Is all a lucid dream, Taking place in my own brain 

Am I insane? Am I crazy? 
Am I losing my mind? 
Or is it just all in my head? 

My way of thinking 
Effecting surroundings 
Reacting according to my thoughts 
Hearing the walls crack 
Confirming my actions 
My every move down to the second 
I make itI think it 
I want to believe in 
The signals the sings and the message 
Have I anything 
In my hand at all or am I just 
Beginning to see things 

An illusion,	 This never ending maze 
A hallucination, Trapped in a perfect circle 
I know reality,	 Caught in the same old cycle 
Is all a lucid dream, Taking place in my own brain 

Am I insane? Am I crazy? 
Am I losing my mind? 
Or is it just all in my head? 

Paranoiaeating me alive 
Paranoiaeating me from the inside 
Paranoiamakes my life a living hell 
Paranoiais all I got left in me 

My eyes dilated 
My mind dilated 
My life dilated 

My eyes dilated 
My mind dilated 
My life dilated(Instrumental)Your body's full of nothing
And your brain is full of lies
You may pretend to be a man
But you know inside
There's only putrefaction, gangrene...
You have no soul
I'm waiting for the day you'll puke
Your crap and you'll fall
Life is a fake and a mental disorder
Life is a fake and a constant
Breakdown
Freedom is a whore
And your noxious utopia
Freedom is a whore you can never pay

In flames this world
Will forever drown
Surface decomposed, paralyzed
Ossified, no one seems to care
Cause it's easier to deny the truth
With a line of snow to share
Isolated, mermetic, cynical,
How come your mind became so close?
You ignore my hate...
But inside of me it grows
Life is a fake and a mental disorder
Life is a fake and a constant
Breakdown
Freedom is a whore
And your noxious utopia
Freedom is a whore
You can never pay
On the roads of my life
So many bastards
Tried to kill my mind
And infect my blood
Now I'm walking straight
Towards my fate
With a furious fire in me
That radiates

Inoculate your child
With hate
Teach him the way
To be paranoidWhere's your savior
Where's your god (x4)

Sin after sin
I sweep across the land
Your fate is in my hands
With me comes darkness

With me comes ice
It surrounds you
Aeons Black

Where's your savior
Where's your god (x4)

Sin after sin
There's no place to hide
My spears will pierce 
Those walls

I bring you darkness
And icy winds
Death surrounds you
Aeons Black

Untouchable
Invincible
Victorious

Where's your savior
Where's your god (x4)

Sin after sin
Stare at the sun
Turns black
All life on earth collapse

I am darkness
The freezing wind
I am death
Aeons BlackI don't see where to go 
Everyone so distant, 
How can we relate? 
What is there to seek? 
Slave to lurid nature, 
Answers to my questions, 
Many will sneer at the words. 
Alluring patterns 
Comfort in them all. 
Assembled like cogs, 
Each forged in a lifetime. 
Stutters and ticks, 
No escaping the incessant whirring. 
Feeble mind, too delicate to accept life's true nature, 
Little concern for the world outside 
Fixated on horrors within.Spacewaste, alienrace

The show is over. over, over

Don't come crying to me now
Don't come crying to me now
This one-sided affair is over

I used to call you with my heart on my sleeve
You never knew what to say
You never cared what I needed
Don't come crying to me now
Don't come crying to me now
My days of needing you are over

The tide has turned on you my friend
Shall I watch you drown
Watch you drown?
It's not so easy to walk away
But I will rise as I watch you go down

All I wanted was for you to display
That you loved me for what I am
So don't come crying to me now
Don't come crying to me now
My days of feeling you are over

The tide has turned on you my friend
Shall I watch you drown
Watch you drown?
It's not so easy to walk away
But I will rise as I watch you go down

You're sinking down
You're drowning
Going down
I will rise

Your self-absorption it had caught my attention
Was I better than no attention at all?
You never showed that you cared
In this one-sided affair
So you can dry your own tears as they fall

The tide has turned on you my friend
Shall I watch you drown
Watch you drown?
It's not so easy to walk away
But I will rise as I watch you go down

You're sinking down
You're drowning
Going down
I will rise

You'll wonder where I've gone)

You're sinking, you're drowning
Going...

In the sado-land,
In the lesbians' land,
In the suicidals' land,
In the sepulchral land

Just see immortal angels in majestic flights
And the swords be torn in the air,
See hideous nereids be raised of the sea's foams,
Hear the dramatic, distant and taciturn howls of the wolves

See Medusa smiling in front of petrified foolish men,
Hear trembling and moribund voices
And the wisdom of the ancient messages
It's the divine unconsciousness
Listening sepulchral whispers...

...Of a deep melancholy's state

Feel the coldness of the serenity,
Feel the winds crossing your soul
And the sweet smell of wines perfumed in the taverns

In a poetic suicide in the name of Loucyfer,
From the gates of Langsuyar, the death is the war

The death is the warThe shepherd brings the wolf a lamb to fuck.
Holding a boulder over his own head.
Arms quivering, he returns home to his dead wife.
The impregnated lamb breathes its last.
It splits in half and the Earth opens.
Trumpets deaden the air of the weeping wolf,
Whose tears are firmament, separating
Water from water.So you're just a piece of shit wrapped in a cute packaging
But what do you do when everyone founds out
Isn't it obvious?
Your a lying two timing snake in the grassCompared to my dreams

You'd feel content in hell

Pull the carpet from under me

Downward we go

 

Compared to my dreams

Your chance of killing swells

Lusting from the insanity

Misery is all we know

 

Disillusion

Fantasy

Violent moments lingering

Compared to my Dreams

 

Disgusting pleasure in shape of blunt form

Concussion, immediate crack to your skull

 

 Blood spilt

I will drink

Smear on my face

The smell so real...

 

No dream, all real

No life, all death

Grotesque lust for

The climax only murder will bring

 

Prepare to sleep

Well tonight,

For good...

 

What a feeling

To dream of your death,

Everyone stares as I

Clutch my head

 

All I can do is scream...(Instrumental)Time's done
A while ago I wish you wouldn't leave today
Pride is running front of me
It's all I can
Behold here!
See that empty joy in blinding me
There's only covers without nothing in
Stay and suffer
I spin around and point you the way

Sleeping under a vail of the mist
Being blank for hours since you left
Something's tearing me, something's scareing me
Something's always around when I`m trying to run

I pray your words to forgive my sins
I pray your words to forgive everything

Please be the one who forgives me
When my eyes are blind to see what I am

I've said enough to break your trust
Somehow it's growing wide for dark
Only have an anguish words to hurt
Never good enough to win myself
Just like the prize of betraying lie
Too proud to show how much it hurts to be
What something inside makes me feel

Sleeping under...Fucked with a pig,
Fucked with a old!
(x2)

Fucked with your old wife,
Fucked with your dog ! (bis)
(x2)

Gerontology Zoophilia!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)i am the bearer of this pain
holding sunset of my dying race
existence diminished
as the genes of darkness crossed my very path
watching chances go away
passing bridges of nothingness
there is no such love or hate
passion with life is what i long
it's all for the greater good
and evil that is still lurking
waiting for the right moment
to attack me from the insideThe central fires of secret memory
The privilege of inner life self-fashioned
The small white tapeworm of the soul
The desolate gift of liberty
No marble cenotaphs
We choose the vast of dereliction
Frail as summer flowers
Yellow wasted leaves(music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras)

Do you remember when
I used to be your man?
I could just never believe it, I could just never believe it

The party was all over
and so the scream and shout
that was the first time we laid, the very first time we met, girl

The rain is pouring down on me - I can't close my eyes
Those days will never be back but in this moment I'm searching the bottom of my heart

//chorus
For your smile, my feelings
all the things I don't wanna forget
The scent of your soft skin
all these memories are killing me since you're not here

I still remember when
you kissed for hours my skin
I can still feel your mouth now, I can still feel your mouth now

The times you held my hand and
looked into my eyes
You used to say you loved me, you would've done anything for me

The rain is pouring down on me - I can't close my eyes
Now that you're gone forever, I'm gonna find you in the bottom of my heart

//chorus

Pain - all the pain I'm feelining
Knowing that I'll never meet your glance anymore
I - I''m feeling like shit
I'll never see you,
neither in the arms of another man

//bridge

For your smile, my feelings
all the things I don't wanna forget

//chorus

//chorusFinally this came to its end, abuses have reached their final count!
Nature laughs as we all drown!

This ain't all just keep on pushing life dry!

Insects are to us what we are to nature!

Is this what evolution brought?
This race slowly involving!

All we do is another wound to earth, this is something we will never reverse.
We are the first in the line of the damned, and we smile ignorant.
We can't hide our wastes they are the product of our devouring.
A wound so deep we gave this planet, a deep grave we gave shape!
Her cold eyes watch our pests and plagues cleansed to oblivion.

A tear of sympathy shed to this water-grave peace now broken.
A rage avenges all of our disgraces, her ghost won't stop haunting until we give back all that we have taken her.

We will al be forsaken, we will not at all be forgiven.
"I will erase insects with delusions of gods, clear my dominions I'll sweep them all"
Peace will return to this sacred place.

Nature's hatred will erase the existence of the human race and all of his sons.
In the eyes of a child lies the existence of immense innocence.
The hollow desires of this race and the misery that they create will no longer suffocate this earth, human kind time has passed.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Taste my anger urge
It's all I've got to purge
I need to expel this fire
The aim is only one
My enemy undone
The vengeance took control of my mind

One minute of rage
To get out of this cage
And you'll remember me forever
Danger is my drug
I'm one step to the storm
We're swimming in this hell together

When the silence takes my voice
I become a passive cause
Before ignorance I choose anger
There's no mercy within sight
No compassion to hold out
It's too late, I'm made of anger

Coming out the well
The poison in my veins
It starts to boil the blood of freedom
The anxiety is huge
Reality confused
It feels like I'm about to reborn

Make me stronger now
And let my weakness out
I'm sick to be the docile victim
The roof is coming down
I'm begging you for war
Until you show me no resistanceExtinguish all of the light
Into the darkness we rideSad to love the dark side of my eternal energy
Screaming at the emptiness the only time is past
Lurking with a pure virignity a suffering
The goal I see on my visual field disappears so far

Calling myself to be connected
Split at the time of uneducated
Holding a distance to give what I could
Staggered with admiration sure I will

The shelter of mine can't be a misty wind of fatal sky
Home near by my grave is just a warmless energy

Pain grows from the heart I found a piece of humanity
The endless souls of hate feeding their insanity
Aching ice won't last this torture of self-command
Like liquid energy is spouting from a needle's end

Scared to be in love with enemies I met again
The fit of laughter my disaster overturns the groundElement of life
My little dove
The sky is blue for you
My lovely wife
I've got a knife
Give me that bottle of glue

Element of life
Butter butter cup
I'd drop it all right now
Dearest babe
I'm in pain
Sniff glue you whore cow

Element of life
I'll take your hand
We'll walk along the sand
I'll take your breast
And put it down
And grab my aerosol glue canWith hate
I bring you everything
You have burned me with
Thunderbolts and all
Your self-wounded scrawl

'Tis not pity
That we're made with
So hate conquers all
And I will watch you fall
Through my blood red eyes

I'll remove your mask with swiftness
And then tear you apart
To remind you of your weakness
And swallow your fucking heart

The forcing of toxins
That you will forever imbibe
I hope you feel the blade
To prove I am still aliveBlack, vast, cold, lull.
White flash, blaze pure.
Birth. Star. Dust. Merge.
Gas. Mist. Stone. Earth.
Cells. Form. Blood. Flesh.
Shape. Thought. New. Soul.
Touch. Dream. Plan. Flight.
Fire. Ore. Man. Aims.
Primal elements coalesce
Isotropic darkness
We land in our heaven
Death now fails to find usTear your dress, naked on the floor
Audience is insane for gore
Face upwards, limbs spreaded
To a maximum degree, your blood
Will be sheded
Fastened to the stake or the iron ring
The last time you will hear the birds sing
Dislocation and extrusion
Dismemberment of the spinal column
Burning at the stake
Drawing and quatering
Spectators prefer
Breaking by means of the wheel
Underneath the wrists, elbows and knees
I put a thick wodden crosspiece
This is done in order to
Make it easier to break your bones
The iron tyred edge of the wheel
Is used to smash every individual limb
Including joints and hips, but I made sure
Not to strike a deadly blow
Now you're untied and plaited to the spokes
After which you will be hoisted to the top of the pole
The crows will peck out the eyes and rip away bits of fleshSo abhorred
They are so dedicated, they carry a lost passion
In the sense of word and gesture, mankind's faith remains withheld

In opposition
Is this the remnant of the fallen messiah?
The fallen, blind, religious dogma
Must we hold the unquestionable to be true?

Is your faith within the confinement of your interpretation?
(Let it not inflict or conflict!)
Let it not inflict gloom as soon as we hear the word...
Torture!!!

(Torture?)
Torture...
Who adheres to the concept of immorality?
Can I?
Better yet... Can you?
Let this not be deemed immoral!

Whether we submit differently, difficulty or gladly
One gives another what they want or deserve.
Doesn't that sound strange to you?
Doesn't that sound immoral?
Let immorality remain in security,
Let abhorrence be at one with silence.Counting down the days
That keeps us apart
Waiting for your rays
To shine on my heart
Breathing the light breeze
That whispers words of trust
Resting on these old trees
I'm cleaning away the dust
Evil tries to bring me down, again, in the night

The bluest waves of sea
Carry on the golden key
All the things I never see
Are the ones I always need
Pain and sadness tie me down again, in the night

Distant shore,
Can I ask you how much more
I'll be here to implore
To keep me alive
Distant shore,
I must tell you
I'm unsure
If I'll ever be ready to save myself

Walking through the stormy wind
I can feel a spark of hope
everytime I touch my ring
I'm relying on a rope
I do know that I can climb the wall of doomThe time has come!
I'm ready to kill
No one can stop
My holy will

The fury of the sea
The stars collapse
I will shake the world
The ruines will crush you

Chorus:
Diving in a bloody sea
Human kind will burst into tears
Everyone in his own cell
The world is the gate of hell

Brother against brother
son against father
Each one against himself
And the killer beast will come

The time has come!
Is the last day for you
Prepare yourself
To the neverending pain

Chorus

The time has come!
I'm ready to kill
No one can stop
My holy will

Chorus X2

Your will to escape is only a fuckin' dream
It is impossible to escape from my will
Now my angel is going to come
for having a report of what you have done!Chin is positioned to the lower bar
Whereupon the cap is made to put on
Down by means of the screw
The headcrusher is used on you
The caps are furnished with soft material pads
In order to leave no mark on your head
Teeth are crushed into their sockets
And the surrounding bone is smashed
Until the brain is forced out
Through the fragmented skull
Just a few turns of the screw 
Are sufficient to make you do what I want you to doFriday night it's getting late 
Too tired to masturbate 
A figure walking down the hall 
It's a fucking booty call 

sXc 

Late night calls, sneaky texts 
Ex girlfriend is getting vexed 
There's only one thing left to do 
I'm gonna have to ruin you 

sXc(Instrumental)Alpha Draconis!
Star system of the black abyss
Home to gods of ancient earth myth

Upon the earth, they descent
Gods from the sky, malevolent!

We have come to...
Feed on all of you

Reptilian race descends to earth
In search of power and for your blood

They want to rule the world
And enslave all of the humans

They are motivated
By power and by corruption

Now hidden underground
Our kind will not be found
Once revealed you will all bow!

We are the reptilian elite
We feast on human meat
You feed upon our deceit!

Blood-line of royal genetics
Demonstrative power of eugenics
Killing all of the heretics

Look deep into our eyes
Underneath our political disguise
And see visions of your demise

Upon the earth, they descent
Gods from the sky, malevolent!

We are the
Annunaki

We are the
Chitauri

We come from Alpha Draconis
To drink your blood on the solstice

We've reigned for thousands of years
Feeding and eating all of your fears

Reptilians dictate your future
New world order of slavery and torture

We are your secret reality
Now and forever into eternity

Reptilian race descends to earth
In search of power and for your blood

For

Your

Blood!The human flock is bleating
Their mindless, pointless feeding
Makes them fat and lazy
Their minds are dull and hazy
Sick and pathetic.. weak and diarrhetic
A waste of time and space
When from some darker place
The wolves descend!!!

A plague of locusts... like lightning from the sky
The new centurions with a world to crucify
The Devil's Inquisition
We will break you on the wheel
Panzer division... grinding bodies under steel!!!

There's no escape.. torture and rape
Death and destruction.. it's judgement day!!!

Your worthless prayers.. will be forever silenced
By mass destruction elevated to a science
You offer no resistance.. show no defiance
You will learn the meaning of ultraviolence
Ultraviolence!!!

We will build an empire.. unlike any other
Where the masters of our race
Lead human sheep to slaughter
It's raining blood from heaven.. your judgement day has come
Your world will be destroyed
Slaughter of Elysium!!!

All hail the new centurions marching in the street
Satanic storm contingent - killer elite
Triumph of our wills.. we will grind you under heel
Show you for the pigs you are
With your dying breath
We will make you squeal!!!

Like human swine lined up for slaughter
Your blood will flow like water
Like a river to wash the world away
It's judgement day!!!
There's no escape, torture and rape
Death and destruction, it's judgement day!

Deny Christ the deceiver, become your own redeemer
The choice is yours, live like a slave or die by the sword
Let the games begin!!!

Your judgement day has come
Slaughter of Elysium
Crucifixes overturned
Synagogues and churches burn
A new religion.. based on Ultraviolence
We will build a new tradition
Throw the fucking christians to the lions!

It's raining blood from heaven
Your judgement day has come
Your world will be destroyed
Slaughter of Elysium!!
The endless slaughter.. of human fodder
Slaughter of Elysium(Verse) 

I am the man who sees the end of days. 
Lost in the land of the beast 
No humans left. They have all been changed 
To all these monsters from the East. 
you won't be saved 

(Pre chorus) 

(Verse) 

Oh precious child. You were once by my side. 
Now to them, you are a slave 
Tricked by their masks... their masks and disguise 
They're out for blood, it's what they crave. 
One of us. 

(Pre chorus) 

(Chorus) 

And in this land of disarray 
They're out for blood and I can see 
That you are not of this world. 
Where has this life taken me? 
Oh, these beasts, they cannot be. 
You are not of this world... 

(Bridge/Solo) 

(Chorus) 

And in this land of disarray 
They're out for blood and I can see 
That you are not of this world. 
Where has this life taken me? 
Oh, these beasts, they cannot be. 
You are not of this world... 
Not of this world.Anyone? Could you see the pain
that dwells inside of me?
To whom it may concern
I ask for justice, even in a small piece
 
If I had lived in
this place since its inception, I would see
All this process of degradation
What a waste! What a waste!

A thousand years, yet we see nothing,
not even a thing to be to be proud of
Always cling to our past fortune,
but that was made by our forefathers

If I had lived in
this place since its inception, I would see
All this process of degradation
What a waste! What a waste!
Does anyone care? Enough of this hell!
Fading solemnly to obscurity!

Holding The Light That Is Still Shining The Threshold... Like A Dream Within A Dream, A Vision Within A
Vision. Millions Of Thoughts They Stream. Emotional Awakening By A Deception. When I Look Into My Own Mind
Standing Beside A Broken Window. Shimmers Of Hope Are Steaming From The Remains,
Reflected By Opaque And Broken Glass. A Light Breeze Of Disarray To Reunite Flesh And Mind. Each
Time When And Then, Driving Me Deep Into Misery. Doubting On My Own Fellow, The Threshold Of
Emotional SufferingDoo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

Haha, shit... Ha, ha....Pulsing through my heart it's rising  
Thinking can I really die  
Just when I have started living  
Falling faster to my hell  

It's a burning in my chest and  
No more feeling in my legs and  
All this time it's been here and i've  
Never felt it anywhere  

It is taking over  
Halt and stopped my life  

I cannot see straight  
Something's coming at me  

Swallowing me whole(Instrumental)You are knocking at my private door
Yes, you, the shadow of my very soul
My very soul
A covert companion in my part of darkness
No common world light shall connote to illuminate
Illuminate me

Together we travel into my deepest realm
Together we invert the law of material bliss

I don't need fake sympathy
Let my world spin, I will not be there to care
I will remain isolated
until the coming of my time

I have my truest identity
and the real side of me will be kept off surface
Kept off surface
I am here but they will never see me
It is no matter, what if they would call me insane?
Oh, am I insane?

Together, we laugh at the everyday issues 
Together, we seek for pleasures of a loner

I don't need fake sympathy
Let my world spin, I will not be there to care
I will remain isolated
until the coming of my timeWhen I was young in the beginning
I saw her, and my fate was in her hands
She said: in my eyes you see the sorrow
In the light of the moon, drink my blood
It's my desire as you'll be eternal

I remember her beauty, her black eyes, her long hair

I drank her blood, and I was doomed to eternal existenceWalking to the black night
Passing by the cold stone of graveyard
The Moon, my Mother, made of never-ending nights
Reveal at my eyes and I follow Her voice

Dark ruin were standing out over the plain
Protected by a ghostly wood
They spur me on to get there
From my blood... life after death

Funereal monument to fallen infernal progeny
Children of night raise their groams
I'm waited by the Dark Countess of Karnstein

The cruel contessa came
With her embrace of death
She dragged me in the sweet infernal oblivion
While my blood was flowing in her mouth

Oh sweet descent in the illusory heaven
Blood is life, given trough my death
Children of the night
Wonderful Lilith descendance..When you looked towards the heavens
you faced the wrong way
your actions slaughter saints
to whom you need pray

No need to take communion
you've been feeding all along
on ancient existence
old as time is long

The rising sun desecrates the embodiment
of a blue earth
destroying the balance of a system in place
since all life's birth

Revolution
in the water

Untold treasures
lay hidden inside
bodies left plunging
a black hell awaiting

Don't swim through the water here
don't feed from the food found here
what floats above all men must fear

Don't swim through the water here
don't feed from the food found here
what floats above all men must fear(I could see you run on terraces,
I could see you struggle against the wind,
The cold was bleeding on your lips.

And I saw you break and rejoice at being dead,
     O more beautiful
Than the lightning when it stains the) white windows (with
     your blood.)Pray God's not here love. You should hide your downfall ...and do you remember?(Instrumental)Never want to grow old
It's to much hassle I've been told
Wanna live my life to the fullest
And rock 'n roll until I die

Driving down to the liqour store
THe fridge is empty and I need some more
Meet the guys down on the block
We'll party in the name of rock

I wanna feel like I'm alive
I wanna take it to the sky
I live my life to the mac
I don't want to relax

Waking up I'm kind of numb
A perfect stranger make me come
Last night it was insane
We'ew livin' life in the fast lane

I wanna feel like I'm alive
I wanna take it to the sky
I live my life to the mac
I don't want to relaxThe ancient texts 
Speak of a ritual 
Summoning a creature 
From beyond 

A godly figure 
To control mankind 
Good old times 
An idol to worship for 

And as usual 
This story features a man 
Corrupted by greed 
With a lust for power 

Driven to apathy 
By his life 
An atheist 
Alone in this world 

He lures nine people to his house 
Into the basement 
With a magazine ad 

And hours later 
Over the pentagram 
Volunteers now chained 

Desparately squirming 
No chance to escape 
The fun part can begin 

One hit two hits three hits Four hits 
Again and again and again 
Pieces of flesh 
Streams of the blood all over 

First victim second victim third victim 
All nine are dead completely dead 
Man glares insanely around 
Sacrifice is over 

And now the flesh of volunteers 
Hanging on those walls 
Signs of the sacrifice 
Disgracing the hall foreverBas Mana Asura Rajuge Sohone ipadune

there is the cracking of the head, the music swells under the
lips, its certainty gets to the underslope of the face.

     Now the woodwork of the face is taken apart. Now begins
the tearing out of the sight.Here now we are eye to eye 
Never have felt this alive 
Move closer within my reach 
Lady of the Blackened Deep 

Takes me in with open arms 
Over me a soothing calm 
Turning to a Fevered Drive 
Welcomes me further inside 

Called to me and now I seek 
The answers that you keep within 
Invites me to indulge 
I feel the will begin to break 
Piece by piece I lose control 
Feeding on my life force 
Starts to change to twisted form 
Lured to the abyss only to be consumed 

Writhing in Dismay 
Won't see another day 
It's More than a passing dream 
Nothing is what it seems 
Chased down the rising sun 
Wish now I had burned 
All hope has been Destroyed 
Taken Into The Void... 

Feeding off my Desires, to drain all I am 
Eating away at my form, this Hollow. 

I just need some form of light, fire, escape here I must try to scream while I can. 
No help comes, I'm dying, now my final seconds, No, I see a sign flickering.In an ice-capped fire 
Of burning wood 
In our world of wire 
Ignite our dreams of starry skies 
And you and me 
As realised our bigger themes 

Oh, take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 
Take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 

Do or die 
What's done is done 
True beauty lies 
On the blue horizon 

Who or why 
What's one is one 
In pure disguise 
Of vulgar sons 

Oh, take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 
Take me internally 
Forever yours 
Nocturnal me 

Whatever burns burns eternally 
So take me in turns internally 
When I'm on fire 
My body will be 
Forever yours

to  put fingers into the water without any single reason and without commitment.
By liquids to struggle with thoughts, to paint chaos and hatred by them 
love, fear, sorrow, joy, the sense of touch and hearing
the ability to watch and to notice the contours
of lying with face in the soil 
in the kingdom of friday on tuesday!

To trepass its borders
it is like to loose virginity
to walk the dark path
without chance of return

We have chosen to follow JesusJimi James was an outcast. He had few friends. He spent his time seeking treasures in the ground. Jimi longed to be accepted and loved by beautiful girls, but the assholes on the football team banned him from that world. Then one sunny afternoon as Jimi dug for fossils, he came upon a glowing purple stone. It seemed to call his name. Suddenly the stone cracked open. Violet light burst forth. He would never be the same. Over the next few weeks Jimi went through changes. He felt a strange new strength in his limbs. And as the stone lay in his lab for observation, a mighty presence grew within him. With new found skills and powers, sharp teeth and horns appear. Muscles ripple under his raiment, the enemy quakes with fear. Strange people were seen in the town, searching for the keeper of the stone. Prophecy states, when the stone is found a warrior king shall arise to his throne. The three from Melekron came in disguise, playing metal in a touring band. They knew they had to find this warrior king, the king who would bring freedom to their land. Melissa was Jimi's best friend. She'd been there from his youth. That night was the night she would tell him. Jimi would know the truth. Jimi didn't notice how she loved him or the beauty that she'd hidden all these years. All Jimi knew was that she was always there...through times of laughter, through times of tears. Jimi took her to the dance that night. His eyes were opened, and Jimi fell in love. He knew that she was so much more than just a friend. He knew she had to be with him forever. She must be his bride. The football team stared at him with fury, for recently he'd made them into fools. They planned to get revenge upon him. The spirit of their plot was cold and cruel. They humiliated him and stuffed Melissa into the trunk of their car. Jimi shook with anger as he sat in disbelief... "Those motherfuckers won't get far! Suddenly Jimi's muscles tore his clothes as giant bat wings sprouted out his back. A wicked pair of horns now crowned his mighty head and his piercing roar made the pillars crack! Flying through the air, Jimi spots the car. He hovers down and rips the trunk right off, then takes Melissa into his arms. Melissa looked into his eyes as they soared above the clouds. She knew that it, it was her Jimi who had come to rescue her. He flew her to the penthouse suite of a luxurious hotel. With his mighty grip, he tore the doors apart and laid her there on the bed. But alas, he had other business to attend to! The three from Melekron joined him in the air as Jimi soared, hunting his prey. Have you ever heard the sound of helpless terror? Well that's the sound the football players made. Thier bullets didn't stop the flying beasts from taking them and dropping them into a leech-filled lake....big mistake! Jimi returned to Melissa's room, where she was waiting for him by the fire. Nothing stood in between them at the time, svae passion and burning desire... At dawn they met with the three from Melekron, who told them Jimi was their King. They told the two of the prophecy and the freedom and the peace that he would bring. And so they agreed to go with them to their destiny in the sky. And as their spacecraft flew out of sight, they bid their earthly home goodbye.No regard for human life your pride must have grown 
Betrayed as your empire gets overthrown 
Bullshit falls from your mouth whenever you're in town 
Nothing but a kiss ass, your ships going down 
Organize your battle plan, now it's in full swing 
Nothing but a know it all, baptized in sin 
Thrown about your knowledge, at a bloody cost 
You've fucked yourself this time, social holocaust 

Pressure 

Crept in like a virus, the power was too strong 
Now they see what you are, a cheating, lying, mong. 
Sort things out before I kick back 
One on one, wait for my attack. 
Should've cut the cord before it all began 
I win you lose, my 5 year plan 
Have you ever wondered what went wrong? 
When your life's and anti-climax it's gone on too long 

Pressure 

Keep your fucking mouth shut, the shit stops here 
With blood upon your sneakers it's all become clear 
Has your brain given up, why do you need approval? 
This town would be a better place after your removal 
Scum of the earth, the shit on my shoe 
When you're gone that's when I'm through 
I'll be the one to cast the first stone 
Watch as your life, gets brought downYour eyes, I wasn't born to follow
I can survive, you always try
To enslave my free mind

You followed me in your dreams
Hiding, but on my trail
You found me

Follow me

Now your eyes, I wasn't born to follow
I can survive, you always try
(To enslave) my free mind(Instrumental)WALLS OF ABSOLUTION:

You can't ignore the voice of the lowly

Speaking the truth to this corrupted nation

All have heard your lies, your bills you don't even write

America... Americanized

I won't let them kill my faith

I will stand (I will stand)

Bring down this abomination

Tear down the walls of absolution


This I say with reverence

All eyes are on you now

So make your move


You say you can bring us hope, but this is hollow


For all that they promised, I commend those who saw this coming


We have let the ignorant choose our leaders

Now we're paying for all the mistakes that they've made

O God America is going under

And we're the ones to blame


Our foundation crumbles

Beneath these walls

But we'll take back America

I'll take my rights to the graveit started growing in december
now suddenly half past november
its taken a life of its own
capturing flesh in its vines
attack of sergio's hair(Instrumental)Ravishing nightly whispers forlorn
Singing their tunes over a shaded land
from where mysteries were born
it's a rising storm

The untamed rality is forging through, with a rush and fury that haunts the lifetide
The faithful servant that walks our way, one step behind till we run no more
Whispers that carries the wind, the breeze that slowly put a lid on the light
Only the essence of the inevitable will chant, to return with raging storm poems

From tongue to tongue the word carries on, hovering whispers from the mouth of war
We dare to conquer our fate, willing to embrace the absence of death

Ravishing nightly whispers forlorn
Singing their tunes over a shaded land
from where mysteries were born
it's a rising storm

Travelling with the gods and forgotten tales, dying to inhert its raging poetry, With
Vengeance as companion and faithful servant, The night is ours, the night devours, enchanting
powers the makes the blood rush like never before, What's been lost can be ours again,

Rise come forth defend for what it's worth
defy the monstrous its prey
and cleanse the koma for a while
rise in the glory of your existence
and sing your roaring hymn

From tongue to tongue the word carries on, hovering whispers from the mouth of war
We dare to conquer our fate, willing to embrace the absence of death and
stay guided by the torch we lit by will, brothers fall in to the hymn, even the odds further
to take the right the proclaimer keeps, to add on the souls he reap.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)28 years since I committed a sin 
Since the storm of '87. hurricane breezed in 
And my life was changed, my chances slim 
When someone had hearsay and just called in 
But I soldiered on and maintained my power 
Not missing step, never seeming sour 
But the whole ordeal had lasted for hours 
A mixture of sun and a mixture of showers 

And so I've pulled the rug from under you 
And wool over your eyes 
Behind the guilt looming, I hear the shouts 
And sound of stormy cries 
My sheer enthusiasm hid it all 
And brought you all to tears 
But when the curtain falls the winds tell all 

And now observe my professional rise 
Return to screen from forecasting decline 
I ignore my critics and predict just fine 
But nights are rough when it's just me and wine 
And so I descend beneath the surface 
My presenting is nothing and becoming worthless 
Scream 'its not going to happen' and 'why is this' 
Lying in a pool of vomit and piss 

And so I've pulled the rug from under you 
And wool over your eyes 
Behind the guilt looming, I hear the shouts 
And sound of stormy cries 
My sheer enthusiasm hid it all 
And brought you all to tears 
But when the curtain falls the winds tell all 

I can't eat and I don't sleep 
A senseless wind that does not cease 
But I will sow what I have reaped 
And still the forecast I shall preach 
And lifeless forms continually seep 
Out of this world, sub-conscience creep 
But I will sow what I have reaped 
And still the forecast I shall preach 

Hurricane it won't happen, won't happen, won't happen 
Don't worry it won't happen, won't happen, won't happen 

Hurricane it won't happen, won't happen, won't happen 
Don't worry it won't happen, won't happen, won't happen 

28 years since I committed a sin 
Since the storm of '87. hurricane breezed in 
And my life was changed, my chances slim 
When someone had hearsay and just called in 
And I thought that was that, career over 
Human decline in a supernova 
But now I see and it's in good measure 
I'm a national God-damn fuckin' treasure 

And so I've pulled the rug from under you 
And wool over your eyes 
Behind the guilt looming, I hear the shouts 
And sound of stormy cries 
My sheer enthusiasm hid it all 
And brought you all to tears 
But when the curtain falls the winds tell all500 years are passed, when Templars killed a girl
She wore under her feet the sign of the cross,
She was a trampler

When she was passing away
Her soul arriver to the Lord of All the Hells
And, to Him, She raise he pray

"...for, I could came back under this or other rest
Having lust for life and to feed myself with other's death
Until you my Lord would like to recall my body full of blood
So I will serve you beneath your hellish hosts"

The Lord of All the Hell blessed her pray
And She returned on earth being a slave... for eternity
He imprisoned Her in the Haunted Palace made by Himself
So she had to crept in wet ground... or fly at dusk

And, again, obscurity returned on earth
Penetrating the body of a young girl
Sat on Her throne of bones
Living Her death to serve the Hell

"...Offering blood to the Lord of All the Hells
For their eternal alliance
For she could continue her great destruction"BEN!
(Casino fanfare)
CASINO BEN!Genetic garbage - screaming cries
Disintegrated but still alive
Decomposition - they can't control 
Raging pain burning his soul
Another one upon the cross
Death machine infested his corpse
Needles injected through the flesh
Liquid of pain fills rotting head
His life decays under the knife
There is no hope and they cannot hide
That's what was left to him
Is just a nightmare - a bloody dreamRivers. Fading. Hall of undone words. 
Slow eyes. Life throes. Beckoning. Lonely heartbeat. 

Final moments, blistering truths. 
Seeing the reddening hue of my destiny 
The pain is a fond farewell to conscience 
and moral shackles. 

No blocks remain to rebuild this life 
Leaving this world to never start again. 
The whole is equal to the sum of devotion 
dead to all sensory perception. 

Memories of virtue have burned in the ether. 
Sentinel thoughts of contrition beneath. 
Can you sleep? Puritanical by day, 
and decadent by night. 

I've come to be 
the sun and the moon. 
visions of astral bodies floating, 
the silent decay of autumn leaves in June. 

Life is just a stifled mirage 
You were born against your own free will. 
Life is just a stifled mirage 
You were born just to die.Strong-arm arguments are the only kind you can win
Lining up behind weak willed friends
You're nothing but a wolf hiding in a valley of lazy Shepard's
No one willing to cast the first stone
One day your iron curtain will be torn downForests lost their vitality, seas and lakes turns into pools of tears

Dreadful nights heard children cries

pale men don't look at skies

Parched throat in search of water, awful ravens sparkly eyes

Gods leads away their rich chariots, from smashed land and empty goblets

 

Dearth, able to yield a whole folk

Plague, slaughter  of proud Thyrsenoi

A black horse runs so raw and wild

His clogs beat our dry land

 

Sail!!! Sail!!! Sail!!! Away from this scorched land!!!

Sail!!! Sail!!! Away from plague and Dearth!!!!We were the last of a dying breed
Souls hardened by the things we'd seen
Sinners in the hands of an angry god
We learned the hard way that love is the law

Love is the law

We lost our innocence
Traded fear for ignorance
Out of sight meant out of mind
Your justice made us blind

Love is the law

Love is the law, love under will
You stole our future
Like common criminals
Your tribunal world decided our fate
..we were tried for crimes of hate
With no remorse we finally cried
Sweet tears of genocide

Love is the law
That made the angels fall

Love is the law, love under will
We gave our souls away
But we reserve the right to kill!

Do what thou wilt
Shall be the whole of the law
Love under will

Love is the lawwho is this being
half-man half-goat
goatmanMy greatest forgotten fears
Are growing in me
This oppressive quiet
Is tearing my humanity

When ever the light is afraid to shine
And only pale funereal candle make lighter my way in time
I don't remember if I was born or if I'm dead
I am and forever I will be
For ever I'll be alone
Alone with my sadness and melancholy
On full Moon night, my desperation rises to the zenith
Lost in the wood, I look up the sky, and she is there...

" You are not alone...you are mine...my groam.."

I'm not worthy of you... I am cursed
I have to kill for life... I am cursed forever

One day you 'll be here... I don't wanna fight and kill
We'll flight high together... I don't want to have blood on my hand
We'll reign together in the space... You are my queen and
I'm you slave
Whisper sweet words... I love you my Pale Lady

But wait....
I hear them! they're near me!
Fast I have to run,'cause my time is not yet to came
Please Goddess don't shine anymore and obscure their way
For I could run safely into your arms

I see the light... your light!
Now I am safe... in your embrace!My blood leads thy way. for he shall give no mercy
Upon my heart that has been broken once more
I fill the void with damnation
Death embarks the madness within as only thee
Oh shadows that call. bring thy love for temptation
Speak to me now. for I am the servant of the palace
My torment that rests. in thy flames
Has now been unleashed. angels hide their sadness
For they understand their certainty
To soar below the clouds that have fallen
Feel what I feel. breathe what I breathe
Drink from the hatred. and indulge on the souls of man
freedom soars all around. and etched in stone
Thy laws have been wasted away by the sins
As Lucifer's love now lies within
These faces of pain. Whom lost their lives
Under the fallen rain. now the dead will dance.
And all will live and die in the fire
I am now consumed. entirely. completely with hatred
I shall go worthwith. lighting the skies.
And burn the house of lies
No questions for he above within yourself
The time has come. an eternity unfulfilledEmerald and quartz? Fluid inclusions?
Microscopic remnants - extraterrestrial illusions
Deep in the soul of archean age
Derives most primitive rage
Other pockets of a hostile planet tested
Crushing crystals and sandstone infested

Your cold face, looks so peaceful
My passion for you, keeps my sanity away
How I love to see you die, right before my eyes

Death will unite us
We will walk side by side
Through eternity
Let me take your life

My desire for you, is unreal
Your blood is dripping, from my teeth
Your skin is pale, soon you wake up
Welcome back...my beloved

Blood is the life
If the mortals only knew
Singe este viata
In darkness we arise

Walk by my side, my vampiric bride
Hear the children of the night, howl at the luna
They are saluting us, their rightful masters
Our romance has just begun, erotical pleasures(Instrumental)Underneath the moonlight of old Hungarian skies 
Buried in the blood-drenched earth
These barren lands of ice
She was an evil woman with an evil old soul
Piercing eyes emotionless 
a heart so black and cold
