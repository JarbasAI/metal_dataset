let the plundering begin
extinction of the blosseming
in arean the breeding begins
summoning the chapters of witchcraft
luring the prophets to their doom

rise daevas, arch demons, tyrants
master of a thousand sins and diseases
the daevas conquer the holy
let this plundering begin

see the light it is calling
feel the wrath, for it's burning all

fear the light, it is dying
fear the wrath, for it is forever

fearing no light from the cross, across the void
comes forth from the regions in the north
luring the prophets from the path of righteousness
creator of winter, lord of the daevas
aka manah
druj, the liar, from aresura flies
asmodeus
rise of the daevas

scorching desert universe
ruins of what used to be
pulverised by their own shadows
rise of the daevas

fear your beliefs
tears of waiting(Instrumental)We will drink the mead
In this dreamlike promised land
Drink the mead, my dear friend
Drink the mead in our beloved land
Drink the mead till our glory's end

Till our glory's end

We are passing through mountains
Breaking storms, waves of snow whipping again
Mighty hills jailed by frozen chain
Grimly they rise, resisting frosty rain

We can hear quiet Vesna's calling
We can see the birch tree growing
We can feel that forest awaking
We are sure to be at the end of the journey

By our gods, peace is broken
By our gods, we will stand
By our gods, we were chosen
To protect the promised land

My friend, the moon is glowing red
Enemies born from western mist
Perun I swear, we'll protect the land
Many will die, but never kneel

And now we drink the mead
In this dreamlike promised land
Drink the mead, my dear friend
Drink the mead, in our beloved land
Drink the mead till our glory's endBegotten in rape
Blood of the giants runs in his veins
Mother gave way to him on this world
The outset of new splendid legend

The fairest hair around his face
Beautiful, healthy, strong body
Surrounded with dwarves, brought up by the- dwarves
He had no equal to him

The seven summers passed fast
Child in Black Forest, alone
Fear, darkness, Nature and strength
Wolves and the forest demons around him
Slavic God of Fire protected him
Then fear he defeated,
His place in the house was restored
Yet that wasn't his own people
But Destiny came to him
Giantess of untold beauty
Became his lover and mother
She shaped and guided his fate

Yearning to act - this lethal sickness
Drove him to the adventure
The only cure for despair
Are the praiseworthy deeds

Is he a dwarf ? or is he a giant?
Your value is proven by you

The life-goal is to be in power
For power is sweeter than honey
More pleasant than her bosom
Shall you known its secrets
The power is by your side(Instrumental)For the blood and souls of our Fathers
An allegiance to our ancient order

A wardance, inheritance of old
Veins will drain in rivers, bloodred

Pride is the strength that will guide
The flash of the blades in a trance
No one can bring down these warriors
Prideful intrepid fighting men

Into the fires of thunder
The souls of our enemies drowned
And under the sign of the morningstar
The flag is forever to rise

For the blood and souls of our Fathers
Allegiance to our ancient orderClouds are careening, billowing and boiling
Shattering mountain tops, swallowing skylines
Falling from the sky, crushing the deceased
Cracking open the floor, enveloping the ground
Ancient tales come to life resurrect lost beliefs
Neglected daemon rising from below
Decaying, deceased deities decomposing
Earth and sky have opened up, filth has washed away
Destroy and rebuild the land
Take back the throne, purge them all
The heretics(Instrumental)Try to see through fainted views
As reality disappears in haze
A journey between eternal walls

The senses unfold before my eyes
As the endless dreams begin to reign
And my hands slip off the edge

The waters grow dumb
While they descend (behind)
Fainted eyes

Drifting in the streams of wisdom
While recognizing all those banal tales
Sin beyond truth, (I see) glimmering splinters

Encountering my past in flickering whispers
While they drown behind their frontiers
And the rulers sink in agony

Fallacy and false idols
Unbelievable is the human direction
But the screams die away in the distance

Try to see through fainted views
But the dust still covers all my dreams
I wouldn't tell you anywayYou stink of darkness, in hate you feast
From your worst nightmares, the hunger of the beast
Between two worlds you dwell, no one can hear you shout
As if the fires from Hell have burned themselves out

A Beast of Darkness you soon will be
Unleash the madness for us to see
Release the Beast, you have no master
Out from the Mist, life runs out faster

The more you kill
The more you thirst
The more you thirst
The more you kill

As you battle on your way, your blood thirst grows
Struggling everyday with your innermost thoughts
Hear the souls in misfortune, crying out loud
Putrid corpses tortured you can still hear them moan

A Beast of Darkness you soon will be
Unleash the madness for us to see
Release the Beast, you have no master
Out from the Mist, life runs out faster

The more you kill
The more you thirst
The more you thirst
The more you kill(Instrumental)(Instrumental)A virgin I know that wasn't guilty
But I burned her innocent flesh
For her blasphemical beauty
I gave her body to the fire

She didn't want to believe in your glorius words of wisdom
So he tooked her with him to try to teach her in another way

She didn't want to believe in your glorius words of wisdom
So I tooked her with me to try to teach her in another way
She was unable to resist a victim
Unalbe to stand the pain the torture

I tooked her body under your cross
I tooker her body on your shrine
I tooked her bewitched flesh
To clean it from the dirt of heresy

In the name of the father
In the name of the son
In the name of your holy fucking spirit
Amen

Now alone in my chamber
I torture myself
Blood is running down my skin
And sweat is burning in my eyes
Voices come to me and whipser
Tell me all the deeds I've done
Vision come and I see clearly
And I feel this pleasure again

When I close my eyes I see her faceI wonder how winter will be
with a spring that I shall never see
I wonder how night will be
with a day that I shall never see
I wonder how life will be
with a light I shall never see
I wonder how life will be
with a pain that lasts eternally

In every night there's a different black
in every night I wish that I was back
to the time when I rode
through the forests of old

In every winter there's a different cold
in every winter I feel so old
so very old as the night
so very old as the dreadful cold

I wonder how life will be
with a death that I shall never see
I wonder why life must be
a life that lasts eternally
I wonder how life will be
with a death that I shall never see
I wonder why life must be
a life that lasts eternallyWhen your jade's drops you
In our lands by chance
Turn your head and see
Our Motherland expanse
Here born the warriors
All-life in the saddle
Proud- and freedom-loving
Wargods from the cradle

My fingers are touching stones millions of years they are old.
The spirit of this old place increases the power in me.
Nature is the real god the reason for our lives.

As long as my heart will pound
and as long I can breath.
As long as I stand like a man
I will never forgive.

That's the way I have to go
my chosen path.
With pride and honour I fight
for the glory of my gods.
My conviction, my destiny
I have the heart of a wolf
please bring me back home again

I'm standing in a valley
my heart touched by the wind.
The aura of trees in my nose
the same like thousand years before.
The magic of this moment
unique an incomparable.
Nature is the real god
and the reason for our life.

As long as my heart will pound
and as long I can breath.
As long as I stand like a man
I will never forgive.
As long as I'm a warrior
and as long I can fight.
As long as I'm wild like a wolf
nobody will tame me.

A raging beast is unleashed
and sharp are its fangs.
It is coming to you
take care and prepare.

That's the way I have to go
my chosen path.
With pride and honour I fight
for the glory of my gods.

Left her arms her cold parade
Her cold soul is freezing me
I'm falling down I'm falling deep

All love is gone

She was she that liveth and was dead
She had the keys of hell and of death
Her cold fingers froze my soul
I fell and I watched me go

She burnt my skin with her fiery eyes
She broke my heart with her deceiving lies
All my love is gone with her list
Yesterday I gave her my last kiss(Instrumental)Today we fight
Our essence is being destroyed
Their creeds won't taint our ancient land
We will destroy these ilusions

Freedom awaits us
Fight to the end

The end will be a new beggining
Where only nature will be revered
If we die, it will not be in vain

Today we fight

Cause our courage and honor
Will be remembered for all

Lyrics by Ipse(Instrumental)We call upon Zeus.
King of the gods.
Oh! Father guides us.

Zeus is the sun and the moon.
Zeus is the winds and the storms.
Zeus is the earth and the stars.
Zeus is the unbending flame.
Zeus is the night and the day.
Zeus was born men and a nymph.

We remember the time.
When your mother hides you.
From the wrath of your father Kronos.
In a cave of Crete.
And Amalthia feeds you with the horns.
Of wisdom and Korivantes dancing.
Around you.
The dance of men.
The dance of war.
Oh! You are the archon of ligthning!

The years has passed away and then
The christians have arrived.
They killed your priests, destroy the temples.
Oh! Zeus now guide us in a justify war.
This filthy sickness, must eclipse.
They tried many times to kill your children.
This divine hellenic race.
And now the only vision that we have is...
Revenge, revenge, revenge.
Strike with lightning.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Eyes of winters cold
Stare upon us
White winters forest
Stands before us

Elders once told
Of blood melting ice
Warriors hung from trees
And were sacrificed
Pierced by a spear
Bloodied for Odin

White winters fields
Stained blood red
White winters fields
Hundreds are deadSons and daughters of weakness
They don't believe in pagan freedom
They don't believe in bestial force
Grand fathers from the lands of shadows
Narrate us your old legends from our fatherland as it was
Let us know how it should be
Concede us the lost knowledge
Lead us to the heathen stronghold
The great forest from your myth
Mixing our blood and our land
By and for the laws of nature
Forever in our hearts and soulsAnger fear and sorrow
A new identity
So pain and tears will follow
Or stay in secrecy

"What should my final words be?
Is this my legacy?
All tales and stories untrue
Now it's up to you..."

In silence I recall all the cruelties clearly
When I repent on my knees
I'm trying to be nailed to a cross for my sins,
but no one ever believes

This day has turned into darkness for you / echoes through eternity
So try not to give in to the fear / look into eternity

Caught in self-build conservation
No mind and soul's deliverance
My free will's illumination
By mankinds ignorance

Numb all feelings in me
Beyond life and death I see
Sleep tight ... eyes wide open
No dream can comfort me

Here is comes ... the shame again ... ends in voicesWarrior face shows nothing but hate
He's determined to march into the forthcoming
War!

No mercy he'll reveal
Adverse the enemy
With his regrettable resolve

Now is the time to cut some flesh

Soon the battle begins
With men fighting side by side
Slay down the enemies - with heathen might

Now the battle begins
The men are running side by side
Down to the battlefield
Roaring and looming with axes

With the sword in his bloody hands
He kills for honor and the gods
But the massacre ends very quick
When an arrow gores through his chest

He dies
Blood spills out the wound
Valkyries fly through the air
To take him to valhall

Though you can see
The battle's not won yet

Swords will clang
Amours burst - asunder
Many men
Give their lifes
For the ancient gods

Gates of valhall
Are quaked loud by
Victory screamsCan't rain all time 
Take this pain far from me 
Uncertain just live in my brain 
Can't rain all time(Instrumental)An inner dance of chanting flashlights
Remove your fears with the flavor of new
Try to reach the aim, silently in the night
Souls like hell won't burn anymore

Hunting the sun, searching for the light
Beyond the stars and the skies
On wings of salvation
Crimson wind in the twilight

Born in a lake of tears
This pain inside my mind is finally dead
Today it's time to live the new dream
Step after step, black after white

Seeking the truth, flying through the night
Beyond the stars and the skies
The wings of salvation
Burn the evil in your heart

Soul cries as the mind dies
But wings of salvation
Will take your love away with me
In a foreseen land of hopes

The beauty of darkness, the burning of abyss
Free from boundaries, free from lies
Proud, new born, marked anymore
Remember the past and learn from it

Hunting the sun, searching for the light
Beyond the stars and the skies
On wings of salvation
Crimson wind in the twilight

Soul cries as the mind dies
But wings of salvation
Will take your love away with me
In a foreseen land of hopes(Instrumental)The hopes fire is burning harder inside my void
Flames getting higher reaching my desires fed by sadness
Dispersed between nothing and fair well
Lost between weeping willow and the thorns
We walk between the bushes
We feel the pain
But we go ahead
Until that the forces support us
We are supposed to suffering and be buried
Left alone with our shadows and our dreams

Burning eyes
Bleeding eyes
Please stay buried
Don't come back anymore
Who will dry our tears?
The rose freezes over the tombstone
The earth kisses the cold lips

Six feet under and dressed only of your dreams
The wasted time has been gone and the dreams rot with me

We are only hanged on our memories
The cry bring us back

Your wounds will be healed
In the dark of the earth
In hush of your sky
Why memories don't remain buried?Into darkness I'll go 
To fight for the devil force 
Now I am a demon 
And a horde 
Of northern darkness 
I leave all glory 
And join the hordes of evil 
I'm filled whit hate 
Pagan land 
From the darkness side of life 
This is the pagan land 
From this land 
Shall demons fly 
Out in battle they go 
To fight for the dark shadow 
Shadow will raise 
In the pagan land 
So true and evil 
The land of pagan rising 
So I follow the dark side 
And became a horde of the 
Land of Christian death(Instrumental)Years of silence without any hope
For life has seemed to forget (about) me
No wasted tears, only grief for the past
Though I long for fortune to come

Falling down
Falling away from the underground
Fade away, searching for something to hide astray

Kneeling down
Into denial for what's to come
Or what has been before

Take me back home, bring me to where all ends...We've been marching under the gloomy sky 
Dispersed into small crowds 
From horizon to horizon 
Since time immemorial, for many years. 
Under the endless vault of the sky covered with stars 
Through the land which sucked blood for centuries 
Through the rising clouds of dust 
Through rain and raging winds. 
Past enveloped in mystery 
Future out of sight. 
Hundreds of thousands of stars shattered in space 
Scattered galaxies 
Where the order met with chaos. 
Everything is only a moment, 
Story told many times 
By travelling traders, wanderers and confused dreamers. 
Legends and myths 
Memorials of heroism and great acts 
Real dreams 
Frustrated lives. 
Everything is only a moment 
As well as this song, 
Which I use to hear sung by rooks 
During autumn days of fallen leaves. 
Sea of loneliness in the distant universe 
Phantom, passing allusion, eternity? 
Jump into the abyss or fly up 
Defy or give in. 
Is it a matter of coincidence or free choice?Growing up I was a kid when I first heard
The sound of metal, I have found what i prefered
Chasing a dream so I would grow up just the same
Nothing changed my plans will not be rearranged

But times have changed so I've been told
But I am never letting go
To what has risen in my soul
This love I feel will not outgrow

I live for heavy metal and that just what I do
No time can ever change me, age to date, I refuse
If not for heavy metal would I know what to do
No one can ever take me, this will forever be consoled

Harder then rock their is a sound you can't put down
Tearing through the screams it's gripping marshall sound
Cletched within these bonds hold strong inside of me
This very fire I now introduce to thy

But times have changed so I've been told
But I am never letting go
To what has risen in my soul
This love I feel will not outgrow

I live for heavy metal and that just what I do
No time can ever change me, age to date, I refuse
If not for heavy metal would I know what to do
No one can ever take me, this will forever be consoled

This is not soaked in you can change so easily
It means more then life to me
Its in our hearts, forever lives, will always be
Are right to chose will never lose
This love we feel now will consume

I live for heavy metal and that just what I do
No time can ever change me, age to date, I refuse
If not for heavy metal would I know what to do
No one can ever take me, this will forever be consoledMadariatza, torezodu!

IADANAMADA!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Finally my odyssey
Has been ceased and I am free
Now it is my time to rise
And to seek revenge
Never should I
Have suffered because of you
I'll come back and punish you
Now it is my time to rise
And to seek revenge

The time has come.
May the weak rise from the ground,
To bring a change that no one could've expected.
You were reborn and sent back to the place you came from.
Starched by the strength of anger
You shall live you life again,
Without showing a whiff of mercy.
You have been elected to reveille justice,
By abolishing the ones who are negating it.
Go, accomplish you quest.
It is your destiny.
Complete the ellipse!

I will turn
The tables on to you
At last there will be a new dawn
And I will fight
For all unwelcome ones
No one will escape the justice
I will turn
The tables on to you
At last
There will be a new dawn
And I will fight
For all unwelcome ones
No one
Will escape this justice

It's my intention to find what I
Have made wrong and have denied
All of what I have become
Nothing happens uncertainly
I want to free myself
Of everything predetermined
Now I know death's not the end
Still I pray for an unpredictable life

Finish what has been consigned to you.
It is the price for a new life.
If you fail, endless suffer will be your retribution.

I will turn
The tables on to you
At last there will be a new dawn
And I will fight
For all unwelcome ones
No one will escape the justice
I will turn
The tables on to you
At last
There will be a new dawn
And I will fight
For all unwelcome ones
No one
Will escape the justice

I don't want to bear this quest
I don't think I'll pass the test
How can I judge someone else
For what he has done
Not on purpose
I want to lose the thoughts
Of my previous life again
How can it ever stop
If not even death can bring it to an end...

You abandoned your chance of freedom.
Forever, your torments shall be repeated again and again...In the distant
Far away
Trying to figure it out
But I can't explain
Now we see it
Now we don't
We're floating around
In the unknown zone

Watch the starlight
Shooting for the sky
Reaching out to catch
A piece of Paradise
Is it true
Or just imaginations
Visions twist around my mind
And brings me shelter from the night

Where do we go
Where do we go from here
When do we finally disappear

Oh future world
There's nothing left to save
They blew it all away
Future world
Tonight we're riding on
The final escape

Is it heaven
Is it hell
Is it the afterworld
Or just something else
Are we prisoners in Nowhereland
Where darkness is your only friend
Kept inside this wall of sleep
Have we fallen into a deep freeze

Left the wastelands
Broke the lines
Crossed the border to another time
Being drawn by the fates
Who run our destinies
Stranded in a state of life
Where dreams become reality

[Chorus]

In troubled times
We saw the writing on the wall
We heard the fools
Who brought the human race to fall
We'll build another generation
And not destroy the God creation

[Chorus]

Take your chances
Turn the key
Open up the doors
To another history
Here's no questions
No demands
Here's the future
This is wonderlandGazing at the sun and the earth 
It's all a lie
With their whole lives wasted
They sit and cry

And as the end approaches
Dusk turns to night

From birth are taught to speak
Only a set form of purity
Unconsciousness runs deep
A weak perception of reality

I see your tears, I feel your pain
I hear your weeping
The only hope is to look towards 
Your endless grief and sorrow

An eclipse of melancholy has set in
For the weak and the withered

Karmageddon- Guitar, Drum and Lyrics
Hrodvitnisson- Lyrics and Vocals(Instrumental)Think of what you did yesterday, are you really taking care?
Think of all the days of your life, did your acts really matter?
And if what you do today changes the world tomorrow

Come and take my hand, I will show you the word now
do not be afraid of the darkness of the sun
There is no more light of our precious star now
We live in the night of the endless black winter

It is time to rise and never look back again
It is time to build and never fall back again

We can only keep walking
There is no remains of the past
We have no choice than giving up
Our corrupted beliefs

Come and take my hand, I will show you the word now
do not be afraid of the darkness of the sun
There is no more light of our precious star now
We live in the night of the endless black winter

It is time to rise and never look back again
It is time to build and never fall back again

Think of what you did yesterday, do you really taking care?
Think of all the days of your life, do you act really matter?
What if what you do today changes the world tomorrow11. Tears of the Gods

Listen to my story, lies here no fantasy
Tale of watchers from beyond
Judging nation that we found
A time when only night mattered
We finally end butchered
Our beliefs ruled our lives
Our beliefs ruled our lives
Needs of conquer by knives
Alone on summit of our land
Beyond shores we raw our end
Rise of an unknown god
Bound to become king of kings
Schemes to rule the infinite
Over several thousands years after
Schemes to rule the infinite
Over several thousands years after
We will still be slaves of a community
Tears of the gods
Listen to my story
Lies here no fantasy
Tale of watchers from beyond
Judging nation that we foundDormant is his energy
He is the ghostly hunter
who moves in silence
and stirs the wild heart to beat with rigour

He is the mythic king
who finds the Grail
Riding on a storm of power
His dominion returns ...(Instrumental)As the sun was rising,
three maidens flew low
from the heights of Asgard
to bathe on Midgard below,
but as they laughed in the water,
their swans plumage cast on the side,
three brothers did find them there
and took these Valkyrs for brides.

Seven winters they rested
with the brothers, bound as wives.
Love's fire burned deeply,
they thought t'would last all their lives,
but eight winters found the maidens 
filled with a longing to fly.
On the ninth they once more took their downy wings
and soared to their homes in the sky.

Fly.

Loss took hold the brothers deeply.
Long they mourned their swan-maids to return in vain.
Gazing to the misty skies from dawn to dusk yet still the sorrow burned, the pain.

Egil and Slagfinn took up their skis and journeyed through frost-winds and Nor-winter freeze.
Searched over ice-realms, searching for love. Steely grey skies rained down Hel from above.
Bleak were the mountains, bleaker their quest for Valhalla's maidens to hold (Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hearken dead walls the tale of lost decade
When the reign of realms was passed to the son the fate shall so dictate
One of us prevails
The one who indites the blessed annals, whose name wont fade away
The soil and men shall wield thy grace, the mark that wont decay
One of us shall prevail

The ruin and fall of kin
your futile deeds repelled
beheaded bricks for my pedestal
of dominion excelled

Dominate, decimate, burn where fields revive
Severe the line of rule divine, be praised as patricide
Lies we shall recite
For my name is the lord and the vengeange is mine
Lies they shall deny
Engrave the deeds, so deep it bleeds, my legacy enshrine

Hearken walls the tale of lost
as age of men dies away
Cruel deeds, so deep they bleed
but scars will heal, marks decay
Thrones will fall, no dead recall
only stones are here to stay
No cairns will tell, barrows yell
and so your name fades awaySee the danger of armament 
Each single minute can be your last 
World is full of killing machines 
And they want to take your life 
See the cruel warpigs, they suppress you 
And they treat you like a slave 
But there is someone, a fallen angel 
And he teaches us to say "No"!! 

How long do you want to be the victim of states' power and force 
Stand up and struggle for freedom 
And be Lucifer's friend 

See the horror faces of our mankind 
And the blood running down the streets 
And if you are dead or alive 
They will never give a damn 
See the lying popes and politicians 
Giving reasons for this jinx 
But there is someone, a fallen angel 
And he teaches us to say "No"!!

Sometimes we think that you are God

ECHOES OF DESOLATION - SIGNS OF ANNIHILATION(Instrumental)Restless years of travels behind,
my bones are weak and old.
No place like home I see for years,
but now it's time to return.

From north to south, from hell and back,
not even knowing what to search.
Maybe the aim was to return
and see the treasures of my homeland.

On this ground my journey will end.
Here my spirit will rest till the day of my return.

My soil below,
the terminal breath.
I'm home again,
my final rest.(Instrumental)Svartesmien budde pao Bjeddla i Saogndal.

There mouths now foaming the enemy's now in sight
Blood boiling and flowing through their veins
There masters now charge on clutching at the reigns

But if this is to be then we still believe
Our days aren't numbered because of our belief
That well meet in the sky in the great hall up high
Where past great warriors' souls shall eternally lie

With our swords at our sides
Into glory we shall ride
Are hearts aren't full of fear but pride
With our banners held high
Reaching for the sky
We charge onwards knowing soon we may all die

In this Asgard the gods are there to see
Halls of gold & riches beckon me
Final showdown the age of Ragnarok
I show no fear as I stand with the one eyed god

With our swords at our sides
Into glory we shall ride
Are hearts aren't full of fear but pride
With our banners held high
Reaching for the sky
We charge onwards knowing soon we may all dieYou're sitting in saddle
Your horse moving hardly
Your blood keeps on running from wounds
The battle was cruel

You were killed and your way
You ancestors wait in limbs of the Eternity Oak
They will greet you with a cup full of beer
And their faces shall light up with joy

Your last breath was down now
Your spirit released from your body
And it sets on in journey
To the distance along near

And the birds flew away bringing bad news around
That you're killed in a battle
That your wife and your kids never see you again
And you'll never go cultivate you'r native land

They will find your body
And burn it away
They'll do funeral fest on you
Sing the funeral song...Dying for His Land

Many times have come years of great sadness 
Hordes of ruthless agressors have attack my beautiful country 
My fatherland, my mother soil
This magic places, where form ages is my home
Where great forests
Where great meadows and fields
Like my forefathers I move forward without fear
Im my right hand I carry the sword
Behind me throngs of my Slavic brothers
We are going to defend our lands
We will never ever leave our land
Sooner I will die in savage struggle 
It's nothing that my blood is seeping in soil
This is sacriface for my Slavic country
It's nothing that I gave my life in battle
Slavia Is and Will be Ours forever
For Ages For Thousnad Years!
Until our Folk will  exist.Translation of the lyrics:

A gale brought forth chants of the past
We departed in glory, families bid us farewell
Our path, in snow and dark, cold and mist
We returned tired and weary, yet proud...

In the silence of the dawn, grandeur of Gods!
at the gates of Slavonic landscape
shadow of doubt has not once tainted
our blue-eyed faces

Only sometimes, in glare of fire
as an calling of Time, sound of river
though children grown up and women weary
our hearts remain forever unchanged!

Till the end of time, skies at our feet
forever solitary path, known by winds...
War without end under the banners of Sun
heathen blood, pride, strenght and faith!

We are not the ones to stray from our path
we know no doubt, we know no fear
even though, be it cold on heart sometimes
and nights, are lonesome under the stars...
hymns of blood, poetry of Nature, singing of our hearts
in the stead of fleeting moments, memories...
we look into future, for past is
now gone
and will be gone not only once

...even though time be such an unyielding traveller
with Gods we shall stand strong in our fight,
lonesome - but Proud!
Till the end of time!Alone the leaves against me silence my tongue
With each day I come here one day longer I walk

The silence is deafening
All rage so far aside
Clouds ride free above me
On the bracken hillside

To drink myself to death
And to sink in the forest floor
Or let upon the bracken
Oh red and green
What solace will it bring?

The silence is deafening
and calmed I am inside
For when I cast no shadow
On the bracken hillside

The truthful have no choices
The power it steals away
Best that the tongue stays mute
I spoke to no one
And no one spoke to me

And thousands asked before me
And thousands will again
When swords have spared the journey
How will it end?

The sky is kind and warming
The flies they will not say
A vessel unseen by the wind
Steers it's own way1998 Anno Domini
(music and lyrics by Nathuruss)

The old legend says that Pentagram shall win,
Faultless gold shall corrode, the gold with Christ within,
I will be the world's ruling Goat, Christ's children will be damned,
With virgin I'll incarnate we'll conquer the holy land

1998 rise of the fettered faith,
1998 Satan no longer waits...

Abaddon's abyss' opening in the empire where Tiamat reigns,
Mankind is not as one, falsity of Jahve rains,
Time of triumph comes, Nemesis awakes in me, 
For enslaving me in my crypt my true face now is seen.There it stands forgotten and alone.
In a meadow a monolit of stone.
Chiseled in its sides are the wisdoms of old.
In runes made to last, tales to be told.
 
A message for the future, written by our fathers
A message from the past, carved in stone to last.
Sent through the ages with rune covered pages 
For the reader it unveils its mysterious tales
 
It was sent long ago, yes so long ago.
Enduring through time 
sun and the cold to deliver its message, like a letter from the past.
 
Oh I can still feel its power
Even now in my final hour
As my fingers trace the lines of these ancient signs
I remember how it feels how the mystery reveals 
 
A message for the future, written by our fathers
A message from the past, carved in stone to last.
Sent through the ages with rune covered pages 
For the reader it unveils its mysterious tales
 
It was sent long ago, yes so long ago.
Enduring through time 
sun and the cold to deliver its message, like a letter from the past.
 
Its calling, the stone is calling
I cannot resist, I cannot withstand.
I have to reach out,
I have to reach out and touch.
 
The power of the runes embrace me
my soul is set aflame
I will never be the same
This is the price I have to pay for gaining the knowledge
From this letter from the past(Instrumental)Stalking the prey is near
Begging for mercy you won't hear
Tyrant with an iron will
Conquer ride out for the kill

Animal bestial, Savage dominance!
Vicious temptress, Savage dominance!

Strangle gasping for air
Locked in trapped in her lair
Razor claws with ease
Strike now sing your teeth in me

Animal bestial, Savage dominance!
Vicious temptress, Savage dominance!

Hunger feed your appetite
Unleash slaves to the night
Master in complete control
Burial deep in the hole

Animal bestial, Savage dominance!
Vicious temptress, Savage dominance!In the light
North I face
The compass points back
Knowledge from other realms
light and sound
light and sound

To change and grow with nature
moots from;
        full, waning, new, waxing

Tiws the warriors fight
Building foundations

Duty honour loyalty
to family, folk and homeland
and to preserve culture(Instrumental)We are the Wolves of Avalon
Lost spirits of Albion,
kings of slaughter
lords of death
for blood and pride
we are all that's left.

We are Wolves of Avalon
our Germanic nightmare
has just begun
Our mighty race
of ancient tribes,
we fight to live
we fight to survive.

We are wolves of Avalon
pagan knights of enchanted dreams
we boil the cauldron of battle blood
to stir a horror yet unseen.

x2
From the the womb of Ceridwen
and blessings of Gwyn ab Nudd,
our time has come
to stand or die.
Upon our sacred soil

We are the Wolves of Avalon
Lost spirits of Albion,
kings of slaughter
lords of death
for blood and pride
we are all that's left.

We are Wolves of Avalon
this is our last farewell
like hungry dogs
our rabid jaws
and send your guts to hell

We are Wolves of Avalon
clad in iron and steel
besmeared with woe
from heaps of slain
we bring your dying throes(Instrumental)As the last leaf fell from the tree,
and dense fog darkened the sky,
they crossed the forests.

Warriors that had dedicated themselves to Wotan,
strived through the land.
They carried the pride of the Nordic god far into the distance.

The shield's light showed them the way.
Through lightning and thunder, they stormed into the battle.

They held on to their believes, as sword and shield broke.
Fallen for their people and lord.
Valhalla was their reward.

The shield's light is neverending.
Wotan's wild hunt.Obscure times, continual war,
Destroyed towns, greed and pride.
Gods destined for oblivion,
Asking for help to the guardians of time.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
Counting your days, judging your life.
No way to escape to the look of their eyes,
No sword can stop the edge of their scythes.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
Witnesses of a sinister past.
When mortals, lost, looked for a guide,
They had to take the guardians on trust.

Guardians of time!

Faithful times, lands of hope,
Guardians' promise, a better world.
Gods destined for oblivion,
Asking for help to the guardians of time.

The guardians of time!
Judging your life!

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
Counting your days, judging your life.
No way to escape to the look of their eyes,
No sword can stop the edge of their scythes.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
Witnesses of a sinister past.
When mortals, lost, looked for a guide,
They had to take the guardians on trust.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
No way to escape to the look of their eyes.
Superior beings looking down on mankind,
When mortals, lost, looked for a guide.

Crossing the night,
As a forest guided by thunderlight.
Lightning can't wait,
So ride through the stars.

And the rivers of time,
Dyed by blood
Of the ones who once tried
To beat us in war.
We're guardians of Time

Crossing the night,
As a forest guided by thunderlight.
Lightning can't wait,
So ride through the stars.

And the rivers of time,
Dyed by blood
Of the ones who once tried
To beat us in war.
We're guardians of time!

Crossing the night,
As a forest guided by thunderlight
Lightning can't wait,
So ride... we're Guardians of Time!Spirit of war 
Which is enlightened in our hearts 
By the heritage of our blood 
The blood of Aryan ubermensch 

We shall be triumphant forevermore 
Enshrine our blood, so pure and divine 
Protect it for the sake of our future 
The fate of those chosen in the beginning 

Der sieg ist unser 
The victory is ours 
Der sieg ist unser 
Aryan blood enshrinedOut of the darkness, he's riding the sky
Call of the wild, inside his steel heart

Soldier of metal, this won't be your last
God of the battle, will lead you to the stars

The Warlord of Mars!

Soul of a tiger, can never be tamed
Lust and desire, won't chain his steel mind

Soldier of metal, there's nowhere to run
Death in the shadows, but you will save us all

The Warlord of Mars!

People of the Earth, we command you to kneel
The kings who betrayed, are soon to be slain

Out of the darkness, he's riding the sky
Call of the wild, will take your steel heart

You live for metal, the voice of the past
Gods of battle, will lead you to the starsHypocritical minds
There is no respect

Here conscience is blind
Thoughts are disconnected

Now we are trapped
In the spider's web

Reality is hidden
By their dirty games

I want to escape from this world
That doesn't reflect me
I'll find the flame of truth
The mask of hatred will fall

Closed minds
Preaching false doctrines

Our discernment is inhibited
Fallen into oblivion

I want to escape from this world
That doesn't reflect me
I'll find the flame of truth
The mask of hatred will fall(Instrumental)In the depths of memory
I watch the picture of my born
The dancing shapes in the flames
The Knife will grow to a sword
The Gloomy Sage gave a sword to me
He said it's time to start
The fate of sword is to defend me
Till death do us apart
I remember life was going on
I was growing strong
Now the days of my youth has past
The Knife became a sword
When I was only seventeen
My sword tasted the blood...
My sword is salvation
Life is in my hands
Flesh and steel's connection
In fight I'll be saved
I am blessed to be right
In my reality
My God is Semargl
Sword will defend me
Enemies to be dead
Just like in my dreams
I will get the power
Of immortality
Fortunes of war
Soon they will be mine
I'll become a King
Before I die
My sword is my symbol
My sword is my fate
Everything I do
I do for my gain
My swrd is my symbol
It's sign in my heart
I'll never be conquered
Till death do us apart
In the depths of memory
I watch the picture of my life
All my friends are dead
Good Bye my brothers in arms
Now I stay in battlefield
Now I'm fighting alone
All my enemies are around me
Prepare to cut my throat
The grip of steel is squeezing slow
Death by traitor looms
I begin to lose my force
To realize I'm doomed
The cold blade in back is what I feared
And I feel it now
The fate of sword is to defend me
But now death do us apart
Me to ashes Sword to dust
Me to ashes
Sword to dust.(Instrumental)NEVER HOLD YOUR FIRE
THERE IS NO REGRET
NEVER HOLD YOUR FIRE
ONE SHOT, ONE TO BE DEAD

THE FINGER ON THE TRIGGER, SO COLD THE BLOOD
INTENT TO KILL - KILL AT COMMAND
ANOTHER HUMAN TARGET, ANOTHER TAKEN LIFE
INTENT TO KILL - KILL TO SURVIVE

INTENT TO KILL

NEVER HOLD YOUR FIRE
THERE IS NO REGRET
NEVER HOLD YOUR FIRE
ONE SHOT, ONE TO BE DEAD

...TO BE DEADSunrise is the magic of nature's beauty
First rays of light greeted my mourning
Heavenly bride wakes me in her duty
As she comes to me on the next morning

"I am Zarja, (Sun's mother); The Morning Star."
Said the brightest goddess, pure and sublime,
Still honourable though she saw my cursed scar
In spite of her the Vampire's bite was supreme.

"Get away from my sight, get away from me!"
"Don't resist, you must fight, it's not too late,
I am here to help you, to prevent the prophecy,
Listen to me, don't give up believe in my fate."

"I am guardian (goddess), The Evening Star"
Said the brightest goddess, pure and sublime,
Still honourable though she saw my cursed scar
In spite of her the Vampire's bite was supreme.

"I don't care, everything is lost, I will avenge her"
"Listen to me, what I saw, is my prophecy
Let me save you, take my hand or be cursed forever
So tell me is revenge all it means to thee?"

"She is Morana, (his sister), The Midnight Star"
Said the brightest goddess, pure and sublime,
Still honourable though she saw my cursed scar
In spite of her the Vampire's bite was supreme.

At the end she knelled before me in all her glory
Dressed all in white she grasped for my hand
And she healed my wounds and told me the story
That was my last sunrise then I never saw her again.Dressed in pale robe of winter 
The aura of grey pastures 
Brought no joy for the mourner 
Whose last memory it became 

From window he watched the birds fly 
Ascending along the north winds gale 

Again the moon is full upon the brook of tears 
Enwrapped in silver - blood from his veins 
Flowing steadily with a smile on his lips 
And the robe of winter became his funeral dress 

From window he watched the birds fly 
Ascending along the north winds gale 
Thus they lit a soothing fire 
Tranquility before the end...Bodyless... 
Senseless... 
Poisoned veins...
Inhale the scent-inhale no more
Unconscious... 
Mind silenced...

Exhale your death
Birth of fire
Close your eyes no longer a liar 
Flesh forgotten now body of light 
Ether betrodden earth out of sight

The ocean purple spirits of the past 
Spells of vengeance on mankind we cast

Floating on a black sea 
Drink the poisoned water.
Drowning, leaving life
Senses fading, emotions dying.
I enter a void a void filled with voices.
Seal the blackened surface - no return.

Fumbling in emptiness
Learn to enjoy it's infinity,
Becoming part of it joining evil voices
Inhaling the powers divine.

Can never again taste 
The sweet pain of death.
My paragon realm
Among shapeless ones.
So cold,
So dark.
So endless...A mind divided, between hatred
Between hatred and the beast
A heart conflicted, by malice
On hope does the shadow feast
It can take simplest thing
To unhinge this world
Even the strongest of earthly souls
Can become unfurled

But there is unwavering truth
That any man can stand
All of humanity can bear witness to
The prosperity of the damned
Darkness taints the hearts of all
Such a little way for us to fall
We have only to stumble
Can you hear the thunder roar
Thunder roar

A soul destruction, no time to breathe
No time to feel the air beneath
A mind divided, by duality
Can courage overcome the beast
It only takes a purpose
A will to succeed
Even the weakest of humankind
Can still be free

For there is unwavering truth
That any man can stand
All of humanity can bear witness to
The prosperity of the damned
Darkness taints the hearts of all
Such a little way for us to fall
We have only to stumble
Can you hear the thunder roar

Darkness taints the hearts of all
Such a little way for us to fall
We have only to stumble
Can you hear the thunder roar

Darkness taints the hearts of all
Such a little way for us to fall
We have only to stumble
Can you hear the thunder roar

Can you hear the thunder roar

Darkness taints
Every soul
Such is the
Way we fall

Darkness taints
Every soul
Such is the
Way we fallDying voices calling me, I hear them in my mind
Land is now so ravaged by adoration of their gods
The pride brings anger and thirst for revenge
We're weak to fight
Requiem of nations
Is there a chance to touch your light?

Weakness of mankind, living in the sin
Break our chains, save our souls

We're riding through the night
With children of the beast
They're ripping our minds with painful memories
Laughing from the hell
We are shackled in the chains
Only God can give you new eternal life

A war on the horizon
The prophecy has begun
The culture of the evil has turned good into dark
The weeping and the anguish
Far away from those eyes
I signed a declaration of freedom from the lies

Weakness of mankind, living in the sin
Break our chains, save our souls

We're riding through the night
With children of the beast
They're ripping our minds with painful memories
Laughing from the hell
We are shackled in the chains
Only God can give you new eternal life

The downfall of the sinners
Only gold is their lust
The age of Armageddon is here
We crossed the lineThe Winter has come 
the forst is freezing our hearts 
the snow it turns all white 
and neverending darkness reigns 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

When the winter of their return 
brings the ancient spirit back 
when their battlecry is heard 
we will rise again 

The woods have become white 
the frost has turned the seas to ice 
our mighty pagan land 
it is lying dark there under the wintermoonlight 

...under the wintermoonlight 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

By the wintermoonlight 
we rise again 

The Winter has come 
the forst is freezing our hearts 
the snow it turns all white 
and neverending darkness reigns 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

When the winter of their return 
brings the ancient spirit back 
when their battlecry is heard 
we will rise again 

...again... 
...we will rise again...(Instrumental)With the sounds of glacial winds' chants
Sun gives birth to the flock of black birds
While the crystal clear depths of the ancient rivers
Behold it apathetically

With the sounds of glacial winds' chants
Severe heights slumber in loneliness
A dream centuries old, beautiful and deep
It is the essence of this silence

With the sounds of glacial winds' chants
Blizzard circles in its' insane dance
And the wolf pack runs by the infinite pathway
Towards the heart of all ages

With the sounds of glacial winds' chants
I born and I die again
I wash in the light of Cosmogony
I am the Universe itself, and still I am but a dust...

With the sounds of glacial winds' chants(Corkhill, Trad. Irish)

Enemies of the high king, a name which was won through guile and blood,
March in alliance to meet men fighting in the name of Brian Boru
Darkness has fallen, death will come at dawn

Men from afar and native sons will battle side by side, to defeat the
King of the land, who made his name by way of the sword and deceit

Brother of the king, the great warrior Wolf
Is howling at the sky, his enemies will die
Brave men on the ground ere night comes
They look to the sky this was their day to die
Come the sacrifice of the legend banner, its bearer shall see no more days
The earl of the isles, awaiting fatal prophecy is slain

Hope is lost for foreign men, survivors run in fear
Drowned in the sea or slain on the bridge, none will be spared here

"Let man tell man that Brodir felled Brian"; the last words from the last man
War will return, the land divided againDarkness From the Sky

ConYour blood 
It spills 
on my hand 
But now 
You'll rest 
Waging fire 
Against the enemy 
I see arrows coming 
Death smiles to me 
No more pain will come from you 
Your life is gone 
Now my tears will come 

My pride, it conquers 
You will suffer 
For all the pain you've done 
My land 
Now, echoes in honourMusic: Panos Arvanitis 
Lyrics: P. Dedes 

There is a starlight shining in your side 
There's a secret that you keep inside 
Burning comets are falling round 
With my soul sticking to the ground 

Crystal tears in my eyes 
When I'm dreaming of a golden sunrise 
Poisoned arrows in my heart 
You're living so near 
But we're still apart 

Flames in the sky, nails on the road 
Your love is poison and I'm drinking all 
Stabs in my life, and you have the knife 
You stole my heart 
And I'm walking in the dark 

Flames in the sky, ails on the road 
Let's break your silence I can't anymore 
Follows the starlight 
That's shining so bright 
Maybe I'm the same star shining in 
Your side 

Thick clouds in my way 
Barbed wire every word that you say 
I'm thirsty in a desert far away 
You're a spring 
And I'm crawling to you baby 

There is a starlight shining in your side 
But there is no longer a secret 
You can hide 
Burning comets falling still 
But my soul will cut like steelNightmares beyond time collapse into the infinite 
I was conscious, all-too-conscious 
Awake but dreaming with you, 
The dead and the dying of life. 

I was to remain in purgatory 
Caught between worlds 
Of primitive nature and material hell 
To transcend physical bounds 

The will to live and thrive 
The will to live then die 
With the soul of darkness 
With the blessing of the void 
To transcend spiritual bounds 

Sand, monoliths and the eternal gaze of moonset 
Darkness had no depth, nor form 
Shadows illuminate an illusion 
To bring eros to life. 

Chaos, Gaia, Tartarus 
Crow, Nix, leader of the chorus 
Animal spirits take flight in the night 
To spread word on the winds 
The whore has spawned 
Love has died.(Instrumental)Hellas... Alas, I gave thee my life.
Then got it cut in half. why? I ask.
Hellas... Alas, I'm seeking what once was.
Blind I dub thy foolish eyes.Among the battlefield
The lifeless steel shines bright
Somebody's groaning near
He knows he doomed to die
Soon Semargl will bring them down
Into the land of the Chosen One
Where they will get their bless
Into the Reign of Silence
The last rays of the Sun
Are fading in their eyes
Among the Battlefield
The Lonely raven cries
So far away from friendly home
Out of the land of Thousand Bogs
And they preare to fade
Into the Reign of Silence
The cold touch of skies
To all those who die
The winds from beyond
Are bringing the Night
Almighty Peroun take us to your realm
Soon Silence will rule
In this Pagan Reign
The Wisemen in white
Said Blessed is who's died
Preparing the death
They are making the Rites
Semargl will meet
Them at Golden Gates
Now there is no hate
Just equal in death
The Radiant God is fading away
The Gloomy Semargl is coming to change
They silently talk to the Homeland
Good Bye. This time is to die
Their life now flows away
And souls now leave their hearts
And nevermore again
They'll be back to the land of Sun
The last rays of the Sun
The last drink of the air
And they prepare to die
To go to Silent Reign(Instrumental)Run from the shore as fast as you can. 
Hold on to the rocks with all your strength. 

Sit and watch as our lives get swept away and our empires are crushed under the waves. 
Deep down we've always known that there's no escape from the wrath of the sea. 
We accept our fate. 

This is the end of our world. This is the end we deserve. 
Our souls belong to the sea 

Drowned and swept away 
Crushed under the wavesThere, where it's said that the Sun dies
its woods were deep,
the ravens flew over you,
land of brave warriors.

Here, where honour laws ruled
Dark Cult to Mother Earth
and the mountains were sacred,
land of glorious past.

Iberia, that's why we'll take revenge,
for the blood of our pagan ancestors.

Iberia, that's why we honour you
with our dark pagan howls.

Now where we raise our swords
Death doesn't mind
as bloody hordes will fight,
land of brave warriors.

We'll devastate everything that has stained you,
ashes will purify you, land of glorious past.

Iberia, that's why we'll take revenge,
for the blood of our pagan ancestors.

Iberia, that's why we honour you
with our dark pagan howls.

That will be the end of the christian dominion,
our land will be illuminated by their burning churches,
the wolf will defeat the lamb.Weaklings,
You are not the only one
Dreamers,
I wish you were all gone

Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience
Cleansed in blood

A burning obsession
A cold hearted devotion
See into the eyes of evil
And see through the eyes of hell

Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience cleansing in bloodIn the beginning, the eternal chaos ruled
The everlasting one.
The one that had sank in the dephts of darkness.
Chaos was the source of life.
Chaos is the source of life.

Everything has come from the infinite chaos.
The whole world and the immortal gods.
The planets and the stars by its cosmic breath.
Gave life to everything...

There were no planets but it gave birth to them.
There were no moons but it gave birth to them.
There was no earth but it gave birth to it.
And even tartars were born by chaos.

In the beginning therer were no stars but
They were born by chaos.
Chaos gave birth to dreadful darkness and
To the eternal night.
There were no commets no meteorites, no planets.
But there was chaos, only chaos...
The infinite chaos.A trip on psylocibine
Hypercommunication supreme
Another toxic god, another toxic dream.

Symbiotic relation
Between nti si tho and human creation
The epitome of the transgalactic generation.

Invisible and Incorporeal
Seeing but not seen
An excursion to aeons of time and space
In the kingdom of psylocine.

New religions, televisions
Frustrations, depredations, this damned place
Would you give it all up
just for the little of bemushroomed grace?

"What today is resolved into the effects of a mere drug
a tryptamine or lysergic acid derivative, was for them
a prodigious miracle, inspiring in them poetry
philosophy and religion."

Phantasmagorical scenes
Beyond the veil of low-life schemes
A quick fix of madness and eternity juxtaposed.

Hollow creations, legislations
Caught within the social maze
End it up, give it up
Welcome to biosynthetic space.

"In truth, he is the five senses disembodied
all of them keyed to the height
of sensivity and awarness
all of them blending into one another most strangely
until the person, utterly passive
becomes a pure receptor
in delicate, of sensations.

As your body lies there in its sleeping bag
your soul is free
Loses all sense of time,alert as it never was before
Living an eternity of night
seeing infinity in a grain of sand.

What you have seen or heard is cut as with the burin
into your memory
Never to be effaced."

" Then, indeed, as you lie there bemushroomed
listening to the music and seeing visions
you know a soul-shattering experience
recalling as you do the belief of some primitive peoples
that mushrooms, the sacred mushrooms
are divinely engendered by Jupiter Fulminans
the god of the lighting bolt, in the soft mother earth."All World Is Damned Place
Dark Fury In MY Face
My Eyes Are Burning Hate
Now It's My Normal State
I Want, I Want To Kill

Because They Want My DeathFar from north we came
With hearts full of wrath
Corpses plaster our ways
Asgard's wicked warmongers

War
We are in War
Against desert religions

War
We are in War

No regret no remorse
Northern Hate

No mercy for traitors
We are the sons of northern light
the old gods among us
Blood of our blood

Brave we stand against all false gods
Draw your blades unleash northern hell
No time to rest we fulfil our fate
Bound together victorious or dead

Far from north we came
With hearts full of wrath
Corpses plaster our ways
Asgard's wicked warmongersI can't believe the sun is shining
After all I've been through
The breeze invites my interest
And how can I refuse ?
The anecdote of the jar
It's taken so long,to get this far
The actor takes his final bow
But...just look at me now
My mind is strong & silent
My thoughts are clear & bright
Crisp & bold
It's my will that holds the key
I once was weak of interest
I once feared dark of night
I once was blind
But now my eyes can see
I can't see through 
The window of time
Or answer to the puzzled rhyme
I can't mend my broken vow
But...just look at me now
They pulled me from the wreckage
Battered & left for dead
Nerves of steel
Could not conceal my pain
My life has become a schedule
My life became a bed
The needle burn
Was how I learned the game
I can't see through
The window of time
Or answer to the puzzled rhyme
I can't mend my broken vow
But...just look at me nowWarmte van een stervende herfstzon beroert mijn geest
Dagen dwaalde ik in het duister woud

De dauw van donkere dagen verrijkt de grond,
en de zwarte kling van mijn zwaard
Ik aanschouw een ander domein dan hetgeen dat ik verliet, toen de donkere wolken van oorlog werden gedragen op de wind en aderen vervuld waren van strijdlust
Ginder trekt de mist over de velden maar de kraaien krassen niet

Langgelee toen oorlog riep zong de wind mijn naam
Nu streelt ze treurig mijn huid bevlekt van mijn wonden zo diep

Waar zijn de tempelen van mijn Goden uit de tijd dat de wereld ontsprong?
Waar zijn de graven van mijn broeders die ik begroef?

Ver weg klinkt een bel die nimmer over dit land weerklonk,
hebben wij ze niet allemaal tot stilte gebracht!
Reden wij voor niets uit naar de zon vervulde landen om het verval te stoppen?
Ik won vele slagen maar verloor ons volk in de grootste van allen, 
de slag om haar geest?

Ik volgde de weg naar mijn burcht
Maar de oude tekenen die mijn poort sierden zijn bevuild met kruizen!
De burcht van mijn bloed verbrandt door heilig vuur!
De gevallen poorten werpen haar duister op mijn schild

Ik roep uit naar de oude geest van het woud, die mij kracht schonk in krijg, die mijn wijsheid schonk in vrede
Maar het woud antwoordt niet!

Langgelee toen oorlog riep zong de wind mijn naam
Nu streelt ze treurig mijn huid bevlekt van mijn wonden zo diep

Waar zijn de tempelen van mijn Goden uit de tijd dat de wereld ontsprong?
Waar zijn de graven van mijn broeders die ik begroef?

Eenmaal kleed ik me nog voor krijg
Als de strijd om geest en god is verloren,
is het beter te sterven in de strijd
Voort ga ik en voeg me bij mijn geesten en goden waarde de grond nog niet gewijd is


Hrodwitnir '97(Instrumental)I am not free, I am captured in this world of hypocrisy 
I can't believe, people cannot realize lies are only short-term relief 

Now I see, empty words constitute our society 
The truth in this world: secondary 

I have no one to talk 
No one to listen 
No one to understand my mind 
I have no one to speak to 
No one to care for the truth in our lives 

I cannot stand, narrow-minded people and people who only pretend 
Pretend to be honest to themselves but they only try to flee 

Now I see, empty words constitute our society 
Every proof of injustice is killing me 

I have no one to talk 
No one to listen 
No one to understand my mind 
I have no one to speak to 
No one to care for the truth in our lives 

I have no one to talk 
No one to listen 
No one to understand my mind 
I have no one to speak to 
No one to care for the wounds in my life 

And when no one speaks, will I forever need to care for all alone? 
Understanding more and more, living on my own 
And when no one sees, will this forever be far away from remedy? 
My conscience is bleeding tear for tear, our world is falling downHuman! Can you hear?
What's ringing of southern silence up?

- I slept I slept
- I wake up from the deeply dreams of silence
- The world - Pile of depth

Deeper nor daydream, when you think of dream

- The pain - king of depth
- But - more than pain - is bliss which sobs deeper
- Die - the pain said
- The bliss sobs for eternal life

The eternity want to without bottom, without bottom!

* Lyrics by Friedrich NietzscheTHE REBIRTH OF THE PAGAN PRIDE 

Now I see the mountains, 
The fullmoon shines over me, 
The ancient blood runs for this lands 
Those mystic places I adore. 

Take your axe and feel the wrath 
Of the ancient gods, 
Now the fire starts to burn 
The pagan pride is our again 
We got the fire!!! 

Through the frozen forest I walk 
The darkness fills the sky, the moon shines 
In the valleys begins the battle, 
We are gathered, ready for attack, 
Give us your power, to win the victory, 
The battle rages 

Cosmic storms blow the lands, 
The eternity reigns in everywhere, 
Ancient legions awake again, 
Seeds of the pagan gods, 
Are ready to grow, 
And finally we have the triumph 

Send us to the eternity, 
The pagan ruins are rebuild, 
To reign forever.For all those who cried aloud 
But whose tears were never heard 
For questioning one almighty father 
Of a heavenly distanced world

Beloved thee who submit 
The holy writings assured 
The golden cross stained with innocent blood 
But stand yet a thousand heavenward

Burning naked but smiling 
Not full of fear but pride 
Knowing death alone could cleanse them 
Of the reasons for which they all die

For all those who died

For all those whose great beauty 
Stirred their torturers to rage 
And for all those whose great ugliness
Did the same

For all those who cried aloud in vain 
For mercy on the rack 
But whom of dying naked in scorn 
Not ashamed

Burning naked but smiling 
Not full of fear but pride 
Knowing death alone could cleanse them 
Of the reasons for which they all died

For all those who died

Pleas for mercy signs of guilt 
Naked bodies broken on the wheel 
Tears sign the confession 
With crusted blood lips sealed

Trial by water 
For all those who diedPrehistoric beast rising from the ice 
Razor sharp claws and blood thirsty eyes 
Slashing and tearing in a primal rage 
Barbarians have disturbed its resting place 
Bodies parts fly 
Awakened as the relic was destroyed 
The beast sends their souls into an empty void

The foul beast brings upon death 
Helpless mortals now will fall

Of the curse they have unleashed 
Survival they fight to the end 
BLOOD TUNDRA 

swords and shields clash in the dawn 
As the barbarians spill their blood 
Like nothing before they had ever fought 
Cursed is the land they had sought 
Invaders die 
None of them ever stood a chance 
The battle stops as the beast is encaged in an avalanche

I feel unbreakable, strong as Thor, because I believe

Take my hand and you will see
The norns were kind
When they chose our destiny
They have given us pride
Strength and a sharp mind
And wisdom to realize
That every man dies
But few truly live

As wolves we are roaming free
Unleash that what lives in me
Burning, I will rise
Heroes follow me

Heroes rise and fall, their place in Odin's hall no one can take

To gather the whispers of breeze upon breeze
Searching for the perfect ledge
To stalk thy enemies heads

Exploration and freewill
Uncharted territories unknown
Revealed to the persistent
Wayward spirit

Freely floating
Without pointless disturbance
Without all work in vain
For the life has meaning
A substance truer than material

The trees
The blades of grass
Grazing over the feet
Of a rested soul

And so I roam
In my life
Not the life of all
Who plague the Spiritless Realm

For what I find
Never touched by those common hands
Excels even the greatest imaginations

This is the life
The fullest of all
The greatest
One never falls!Drifted by the waters both raging and calm
A boat that is noble and strong
Storms and winds would let it drown
Like anchor holding all the pride
Shelter, choking all inside
Shore withheld the zeal to doom us

Dragged by winds into beaches of tears
Surrendered to a peaceful feel
It was me
Pulled through sand with choice of none...
...Broken

The way she moved towards the door
I won't listen but I'm waiting for a word
For a moment I was thinking will she ever know?
Would he ever change?
In her mind counting failures
There were two lines on every side as I wept
And the very same two thoughts inside my head
I could feel her inches there beyond shut doors

Silence is death
in the realm of sleep
where worms awaken
and slowly creep
through twilight shades
and broken dreams
to guide the slain
into another world

on towers of ash
the banshee cries
through shadow mist
and veils of sorrow
to bale fires past
and a haunted morrow

never to walk this earth again.
Like an autumn falling blackthorn leaf
lost in times becrimsoned griefIn the darkness, all alone
I was young, a lone wolf
Christians hunters, raped our home
Kill my parents, broke my soul

Christian sheeps, they were more
I escaped and I grew
And today they will know
That my hate has become their destiny

Sheeps, run in terror, praying his god,
I enjoy when I see the running blood

The terror of the christians
The return of the wolves
We don`t need you, any more

Vengeance! Get out of my forest,
get out of my land,
get out of my home

But now i`m dying
To the eternity I come
With warriors like me
Who fight this war

"This is not the end"
I cried in my last howl
Because my sons will never forget
That his father was a wolf.Chaos Storms Rage, Total Fucking... Mass.. Murder...

With Gnashing TeethAs early as you were born, already you opened the door
When you entered the world, what could you see?
Abandoned desire in the heart, let your spirit find the last part
You know you have to understand ....what is your mission?

Deep inside you the Creator has left a strong desire
You have a thirst to know yourself, so take your burning fire

Here is your life, you've opened a door
A way into the starlight where you will grow
Feel your power and catch this chance
You must find your lost right door ...the right door

I see fear in your eyes it must be turned to dust
If it's stronger than your will, how can you win?
He is reaching for your tears, your burden will disappear
You look in the angel's face and follow the voice of your heart

Deep inside you the Creator has left a strong desire
You have a thirst to know yourself, so take your burning fire

Here is your life, you've opened a door
A way into the starlight where you will grow
Feel your power and catch this chance
You must find your lost right door ...the right door

Right door - what are you feeling now? 
Right door - what can you hear now?
Right door - you must believe and want more
What are you feeling? If you believe it...
You must find the right door(Instrumental)The shades of evening were falling fast
My body shivering in the cold

A light wind casts her odour in my wake
Her eyes reminding me of my eternal agony

Her lifeless pale face in the stare of my eyes
Her bloodless weak body at the moment of
The blackened sky

As the sand absorbed the drizzling rain
It sucked in her reddish blood I made her die

The black sky

Please forgive me

On strange attractor driven loops
Their fate in black & white
Mindless moths
Lured to feed our flame
Cut themselves
To suit the cloth of shame
Naked in the spotlight
Of a vicious cabaret
Made to hate each other
And serve without regret
Choking in the vise grip
Of our feudal tourniquet

On a Sisyphus mission
Shipwrecked,
Marooned in a dark history

Secret rites of old
A way to turn their blood to gold
And cheat with entropy
Tally up!
The dead rats fill the cup
Drink to sate the P.R.I.stine family
Absinthe from the coffin
Keeps a forked tongue wet
Lashing at the vermin

Towards the end of the nights and days

Turn to the left, turn to the right 
Silence and rest in the graveyard 
Turn to the left,  turn to the right

To the twilight they sailing 
Done well 
Where long shadows fallBlackened thunder is rolling
burning lights and storm wind are taking the sky
our world is a moment
appearing in the unendless chaos of time

Powerful forces are striking this time
our destiny now is written tonight
Humanity last breath a carnal desire
world is in ashes and embraced by fire

Our mind is so confined
Our hate is cruel and brutal,
No wisdom could ever teach us
We lived for us
Years and years passed by 
No insight and no remorse
We fought our wars
Fought for god
For our weak believes

Is this our way
Walking on a dead end road
Is this our fate
World is falling down
Is this our road
Standing on the edge
Is this our believe
Held by the strong hand

Our deeds they are wrong
Just thinking of us, no compassion for the others
We are dust
Just a moment
But world is turning on
Summer turns into winter
and Dark turns to Light
No one thinks that we are more than an instant of time

Is this our way
Walking on a dead end road
Is this our fate
World is falling down
Is this our road
Standing on the edge
Is this our believe
Held by the strong hand

Embraced by fire a pure burning light
The end of desire, the end of all fights
Return to the origin, return to the white
World is embraced by fire devoured by lightSay your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed,
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Across the fields red banners lead
Honored fallen stride
Towards the woods where still rivers meet
Feet first they ride
The peal, the pain, the cross, the shame
Fade the wraiths of war
No fatal wound slay searing stain
One that soul once bore

Feast the flesh of the beast
Indulge these spoils with greed

Inside the woods ten circles lay
Sylvan shrine of old
They dance, they pray the sun to flee away
Feast no light behold
The gift, the horn, the oath once sworn
Opiation for palate
They call, and heed the faceless horned
Regale served in shade

Bare the sin, the sun parched skin
Slavish shields of god
They gorge, the bare the flame within
Indulge on pagan blood
Disgrace, the scorn and soul reborn
Heathen star burns strong
Leave chains of flesh to house forlorn
Gods halls where they belong

Feast the flesh of the beast
Indulge these spoils with greedHow we spread fear and justify crime
Sustained Ignorance is the way
Feed the rich and bury the poor
Know that to criticize is to betray

As a diabolic mastermind
Embrace our empire
Consolidate the power and
steal for a noble cause
For this is my crusade
Oh Supreme me

Switch to red as you proceed
They'll walk in line with faith
Remember you're all freed
So battle must come, I dictate

Demonize and stigmatize
We hold the power, we hold the truth
And values we use wise
Since our goals are all in reach
Wealth is to be maintained
And determined we'll succeed

Obscene display of power
Scatters in their eyes
Burning flags and fists upraised
Defiance spreads and grows
Though, polished faith is what unitesTo the horizon of the sun we answer thy call

Our people are strong, one with our beasts
The gathering threat we shall defeat
Honor is our most valuable weapon
Warriors through war
Pride beyond pride

We are the mighty Horse Lords
Gondor calls and we shall answer
To war once again
We must ride

Victory is slim
Death is certain
But our honor is our guide

For victory we will ride
On with pride at our side
The race of Men is why we give our lives
A warrior of Rohan
Fighting for our family and race

Welcome to the land of the Horse Lords
One with our beasts
The gathering threat we shall defeatIt's war - crushed in the sacred door
It's war - demons enter the holy hall
It's war - and angels from heaven fall
It's war - victory for the subterra lord

Flames... sky is red... it's been said

It's war in heaven, the temple is on fire
Red raindrops fall and there is claps of thunder
Like battle drums rumbling for the demonic lord
Angels.. with their harps crumpled around their necks
Use the last words to sing a song, like that would help
You are already dead!

The wind on earth getting stronger
As a new angel scream
And beg for mercy to a king that's already dead
Words from books of holy origin has no longer any power

Empty prayings and a request to a god that has escaped
Abandoned and frightened he hides somewhere beyond
He has left you all behind
The black flag sways on the top of the world
As the riders of doom rides up the heavenstairs
And find the path through the angel dust
To find and crush the sacred life source wellMother! Surround us with your darkness
because we didn't know how to value your kind light,
let your whispers be accompanied by the trees' dances.
Hold us, accompany us in this slow death,
you who gave us life, give us now death...

In the eternal night,
frost winds attack our inert bodies,
the wolves howl from the mountains
possesed by the Bloody Moon.

Finally, Mother, you have given a fair solution,
so your fields will bloom again
and your rives will flow again with their purity, your valleys...
Bring us eternal torment,
seduce us with your winter whispers
so Life and Death fill your being
and shall our blood and entrails,
our laments and tears
be our offering and glorify you forever...

...the Moon presides the sky in the eternal night.

In the eternal night,
frost winds attack our inert bodies,
the wolves howl from the mountains
possesed by the Bloody Moon.I walk alone 
Overwhelmed by sheer regret
Admitting all sorrow
Never willing to forget
In all remembrance
To you my endless love
Lost in the darkness 
With the angels...far above

Walking down the hall
A katatonic state
Longing for what you'll become
But it's too late
Memories they fade
But I still see your face
Comforting me when I'm in need
When I lose faith
Walking down the hall
But you're not here

Now is the time 
To break down
To foster those moments
To end up this fight
To let you go
To the other side
Now is the time

I've reached the end of reason
As many times before
Leaving all my sorrows
Awaiting a new dawn
Countless times I cried
Mourning for your loss
Countless times I pray and shout
To the gods far above
But how hard I try 
You are not here
But how hard I try
I see you disappear
Walking down the hall
But you're not here

Now is the time 
To break down
To foster those moments
To end up this fight
To let you go
To the other side
Now is the time(Instrumental)Uggh... La la la la la la...The wildest man
Half-human Half-beast
Born of the hate
With armoured fists
Cro-Magnon Man - Arise!

God didn't exist
Satan was in cradle
Evil, evil's fortress
He was - independent

Coming from nowhere
He caused humanity
Hunted, but a slayer
Didn't want to be
Great morph - become!

Animal instinct
Managed his behaves
However evolution
Made a man of nowadays
Evil's fortress - opened!Moon, forest, blinding snow
My ancestors call me back home

Don't ask me who leads my steps
What made me follow this path
The thing I feel is older than any words
How can you dare to stop me now
Please, don't, I must go

Strange, moon shines slightly, just as little clouds allow
May inner enlightenment give me a sight of the day's clarity
Frost shivers my shoeless feet and tempts me to dance
The timeless dance with eternity

The last time I'm looking back with tearless regards
Well, I used to love it there
Last remembrance in a mind washed off pain and scars
Well, I used to suffer there

Strange, suddenly I understand, 
All the tones and words whispered to me
A breathtaking song of divine unity
Frost shivers my shoeless feet and tempts me to dance
The timeless dance with eternity

You may have used to know me, sorry if I'll be missed
But the feeling inside is a law
I must keep on this path despite only guessing its goal
Sorry my friends, I must go

Moon, forest, blinding snow
My ancestors call me back homeOver the plains ...
Where nothing seems to move
Where the earth is full of filth
and the river flows to the sea

Over the hills ...
Nature is awakening
The light starts to fade
The first gate for the strong

And the raven flies north ...

Over the fierce northland
Where nature is all
And all is nature
Where Odin's children live

Over the mountains ...
Where storms rage
And darkness fills the air
Where only warriors dare to go

And the raven flies north ...

Through regions unknown
In eternal darkness
Doing his ritual flight
For the altar of the night

Reaching Asgard
Realm of the gods
Where finally rest is found
In the shadow of Odin's glory ...

And the raven flies north ...The Moon talked to me in dreams
In the tongue of the Anjanas
And she trespassed me her wisdom
and her autumnal cry
The sacred woods, oh, sad enchantment,
washed my fate, I saw the portal of centuries,
with wrath in my soul
Summon the strenght of one-eyed-Titan
And let the final battle begin
A sum of perception, divine intuition
I see, the mist over Alot
The sound of the march of Caesar's legions
The forest and mountains... our gods
I'm the one, chosen by my brothers
The son of this ground, forged by the anvil of creator
Concanos drink the blood of horses to destroy
the enemy of our Mother Land
Orgenomescos, Vendios... revenge to our fallen ones
Above the shores of the Abyss we'll prevail
Fighting for eternity to the end of Thy Empire
Our flesh can die, but our spirit will wonder 
with the blessing of Deva
Across our Dominion of the Ancient SealAt the dawn of eternity
 Through the haze & obstacles
 There lays my long journey
 Not experienced before
 
 I'm in dark
 Light of distant star
 Callin' me on
 The black skies
 Cold Galaxy
 Shows me the way
 
 Past unwillingly releases
 Heart is filled with sorrow
 So my mind awake from the sleep
 Suffering soul escaped from net
 
 Heal my wounds
 Heart-breaking scream
 In the shadow of pain
 Sombre thoughts
 No more regrets
 Just a silent reproach
 
 I walk alone
 Towards the calm
 And eternal rest
 Followin' in the tracks of starfall
 There beyond dawn
 I shall sink into oblivion
 
 The philosophy of life and death
 Hope will never leave me
 Intuitive recovery of sight
 Reveal the delusion
 
 I'm waiting for
 Moments of truth
 In objective reality
 When the shroud
 Will fallin' down
 And uncover the lies
 
 Look into ocean of my eyes
 Fire will burn you
 The reflection of former years
 Remains trail at my face
 
 At the mercy
 Of fate again
 Temptin' Providence
 Wrath will die
 Deeply inside
 Even be not bornurs will be here...(Instrumental)Steam rises through immovable freezing air, 
Sun fell down to the horizon yet. 
Dark infinite forests captured by winter greyness, 
Dark lying down slowly among trees, 
Silence rules, silence which precedes the storm, though. 
In the centre of the wheel of time 
In the very heart of darkness 
During the lunar transformation 
It spins delicate threads of balance. 
Before winter strikes in full force 
And wild frosts bury their sharp claws 
I will spend this night dancing with flashing shadows of spirits of the
deceased 
Then I enter the cold grey-like dawn 
And there in the entrails of gloomy foul weather 
Where damp place and icy breath bind us 
I will set off along paths covered with leaves that turned black, 
Along paths which like rivers lead 
Into ways running in the direction of return, 
Across the ravine in time.The beast prepares its attack
Bringing darkness to the seas
Warriors cast their weapons
The ocean falls in flames

Warriors fight for the king
Defend pagan alliance
Using the power of the sword
Destroy the demon of the seas

The black sun on the horizon
Bestial creatures appear in the darkness of the coast
Bring plague and death to the seas
Leaving a trail of carnage everywhere

The cold wind freezes our veins
The certainty of victory warms our souls
Arrows cross the sky, blessed bows
Ripping and slicing the flesh of the enemies

Warriors fight for the king
Defend pagan alliance
Using the power of the sword
Destroy the demon of the seas

The black sun on the horizon
Bestial creatures appear in the darkness of the coast
Bring plague and death to the seas
Leaving a trail of carnage everywhere(Instrumental)Light bringer 
Path of destiny 
Path of power 
...in the coils of the serpent 

Fall of Daath 
the dark path to the throne 
holy knights 
...lay down Solomon's stones 

A blood flag is revealed 
House of the red shield 
A flame lit upon 
an ancient star 

Pale horse rider 
Hidden sorcerer

...in the shadow of Moloch's altar 

Chaos bringer 
Sun crowned Emperor 
New World empire 
...witness the falling tower 

The great work of the ages 
A great sleeper is awakened. 
A great conflagration 

The fall of Rome is here 
The fall of Babylon is now 

Let the crumbled remains of the fallen temple 
spread across the corners of this world. 

Let the ashes of the great architect 
fertilize the new Earth.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Cold wind is singing a song to me
About a great snowy land
It revealed me saga about a fairy place
On that huge Earth
I often dream magic dreams of that
By winter enchanted land
And I wanna tell this tale about
The snowly land of the endless winter.
Obeying to the ancient gods' pledge covered
The snows this land throughout for ever
And in rivers, lakes and seas beneath the ice
Flows blue water no more.
Mountains and woods, fields and oakgroves
Are carpented eternally with sparkling cover
Within endless winter's power the whole world sleeps
Eternal fairy dream.
Every thing around keeps silent, no sound is heard
Every single thing is bound by magic silence
And at once dies down into the night
Every thing is white thoroughout,
and there's no life
Which used to be, seen beneath snow
But the bright sun hot arrow will
Never melt the snow
Nothern wizards covered all skies
Through with huge magic black coat
And at the sun dungeon guard stands
Faithful guardsman with sword
Black ravens fly over land
And search for prey among the snows
No one will ever save this land from
Eternal sparkling snowy fetters
And every thing's gonna remain as before
Through years pass by swiftly
Fly with me into this nameless land
Where eternal darkness will rule forever!Endless rails
Empty space
The train is hurtling through the night and I'm alone in empty coach
Light spots run away, then new ones approach from the dark
From the dark
So it was

I was heading to the strange city of the midnight sun
Can I leave my inner hell, or it is just aimless run?

But for now just the road exists
Plains that covered with mist 
And the rattle of tireless wheels
And no more me

Heil the nordic city
I'm right here in front of you
The old emperor Peter
Accept my challenge, assuage my throe

But these bold words left untold
And the city was so cold
And beyond expression beautiful
But there is no place for the exile

Roaming in the maze of
Narrow streets and well courtyards
I was waiting for a sign
How to calm my weary heart

But the world around was quiet
And my cry left unrequited 
All the things were passing me by
Who can ever hear the silent cry?

Afternoon I saw my death 
Arrogant and confident
Strolling leisurely in the crowd on the far side of the street 
Crimson patterns in my eyes
And the chill from the other side went down the spine

At the sunset I went down
Almost ready to give up
But salvation came from an orchestra which was playing in the park
Half-forgotten retro tune
Caught me with the lulling croon
And it blew my soul beyond the horizon

Still alive
In the deep of night I find myself still alive
I don't know why
Is this a second chance of just unkind jibe?

An opportunity
To fix everything that someone granted to me
Could it be?
Or just wanton prolongation of the agony?

Though my soul was torn apart 
And my ego's skin is sloughed
I left there a piece of heart
But it does not matter now

For now just the road exists
Uncertain future in the mist
And the wrath of hunted beast
But not pain

Wonders that I have to see 
'til I meet my destiny
No more me but nevertheless
Here I amBy whirling wind
Ashes twilight
By whirling wind
Ashes vortex
Burned to dust
Inner treasure
You've never owned
Reaching soil
To be buried
To be digested
In a hole worst
Then the demon-walley

Wind may help
The roaming.
The rind of tree
A stronger and elder being
Used to be eloth
Or souldefender
You've been thirsty for the poison
The bushserpent gave it to you.
By whirling wind
Ashes twilight
By whirling wind
Ashes vortex
Burned to dust
Inner treasure
You've never owned.
It has been better
Before food of traptooth,
Myth of thy soulmirror
Did not exist with us
All has been dead
Who rendered homage then
Who was mourned by none
Do living
And no dead.Now proud our legions stand, our banners fyin' in the wind. Swords glisten, shinin' in the sun ere it's begun the battle's won...

I'm the one
Here's my son
He was born
Out of the sun.
I'm the one
Here's my son
See his heart
His time is come so raise the battle hail...

See how the weak ones flee; the proud and strong alone will stay. Raise weapons, harken to the sound which cleaves the sky and curs the ground...

I'm the one
Here's my son
He was born
Out of the sun.
I'm the one
Here's my son

His time is come so raise the battle hail...

Raise the mighty hand of doom and reach our with the sword of justice to smite from the earth all those who dishonour the virtues of power, strenght and might. Let their screams fill the air, let their lifesblood fall on the battle- scarred earth, and let our mighty legion drink the blood of all those who stand against us in defiance of our noble quest.
Lords of death, I heed your call... now take my answer...

Here's my son
See his heart
His time is come so raise the battle, raise the battle hail...I hate - Your betrayal, my strength
I hate - I seek to seal your fate
To feast on your entrails
Engorge myself in your embrace

Hate, pain, lies - Hate, pain, lies

Betrayal is your only friend
The lies that keep you all but safe
Striving for a better place
Positioning yourself
Deception is your only game
Optimizing your pursuit
Self-inflicting lobotomy
No empathy is left for you

I hate - I violate your faith
I take it upon myself
To straighten out the mistakes you've made

I hate - I trusted your intent
Your dagger is my mortal coil
Steel that pierce my very soul

Hate, pain, lies - Hate, pain, lies

A Judas of  the present day
The Brutus of my life
A sneak assassin in disguise
I won't back down without a fight
Trust has died a violent death
No compassion, no regret
I'll make you eat your lies
Removing your disguise

I hate - You will regret the day
The day you looked my way
Mark my words... you will pay

Hate, pain, lies - Hate, pain, lies

I am void of all my fear
Boldly go where eagles dare
Feeling strong within myself
Trusting in my own intent
Standing tall, spirit high
Watching as your vigor dies
It's hard to lie without breath
Impossible to stab when you are deadBragi sung the songs
that once many forgot,
Tales and legends beautiful
the proud few have sought,

Our walls of shields
forged embrace of valor
Witness with my eyes I see
those faithful to the gods,encoded pride,
In the fields we fight through rustling winds,

My heart forever strong
At an early age that they teached
Of their wisdom and the runes
that death is not the end...
Our culture shall never fall,

Pride and honor runs through our blood
Defied their heaven and the cross,
Passionate my heroic proud forefathers
passed down their gifts to my brothers,

Warrior spirit we are born
we shall resist until the end,
Until the last one of us stands
Summer we shall march back home
Our folk breaths glory...to the end,

Enchanted the ride to Valhalla
My illuminated path shines bright,
Sunna-she grants my forefathers and I

Forever proud
From the bed of the Rhine river
to the green English Isles
We will resist until the end.In The Deep Dark Forest
Elders sit by the fire
They are praying for pagan deities
And saying the incantation:

Perun - great god of thunder
Dazhbog - great god of Sun
Chernobog - god of darkness

We're asking for your help for us!
Priests make sacrifice
And idols again in blood
Ancient pagan rituals
Open doors to other world

Svarog - great god of skyfire
Yarilo - god of fertility
Kharachun - god of death!

We're asking for your help for us!

Perun - great god of thunder
Dazhbog - great god of Sun
Chernobog - god of darkness
Svarog - great god of skyfire
Yarilo - god of fertility
Kharachun - god of death!

We're asking for your help for us!
We're asking for your help for us!Darkness in flames. Shadows weeping through the night. Impaled thoughts across the skies of the old world. Praise the frozen north. It's inflamed skies shutter at todays meaningless worries. Destroy peace. Intiate war and bring about change. Bring the once forgotten past to life again. Reject the lies of the so-called savior. His untruths have plagued our world far too long. The lies of history, tell the lies of those who oppose us. Engulfed in the darkness of the north. Let the skies of old reap the souls of the believers. This is our world. This is forever.(Instrumental)In Temple Of Mirrors I see The God 
 All World is reflected perception of mine 
 I draw this illusion by paints of my blood 
 The Will to Create is my vital lifeline 

 Soaring the skies, diving the water 
 Enveloped in flames I felt down to Earth 
 To enter the Gates 

 In Temple of Mirrors I see the Beast 
 My Mind is a vessel with poison of hate 
 It crawls in my being like a shadow in mist 
 The hand of destruction that is my fate 

 In Temple of Mirrors I see the flesh 
 It borders my Mind in dimensions of Time 
 Without my thoughts it is only a trash 
 Existence turns it into source of Light 

 In Temple of Mirrors I see no one 
 My World will exist while I am alive 
 Between Here and Nowhere I'm standing alone 
 All Universe falls from edge of my knife 

 Soaring the skies, diving the water 
 Enveloped in flames I felt down to Earth 
 To enter the GatesLuna shines upon us with her silver mourn smile
While the tree-spirit watch us
What's the name of the man who tries to steal the life?
Why he forget where he came from?
Now from the heart, the flame-hair arise
To slay the goddamned reaper
And the whole humanity will suffer now to pay
All the crimes made against the mother

Raping the earth for greed, based on partial philosophies
Movements of narrow mind men, writing our future sentence
Predator spirits wakes, eyes closed to the prey
No more machines of pain, no blood spell through the land

Burn!
Now it's time to clean the earth of the human plague
Curupira rises to avenge the indians murdered
Spirits of the land will be with him on his march
When his turned back feet smash the "right way of life"

And forests will breathe with all the splendorous beauty
Beasts will live and rivers will run free under the sun
Untouched earth will rise, immaculate being
And fire-hair will rest and run with the wind...once more!Hidden in the Dark woods surrounded by shadows
It circles without decree to find you
Dirty of betrayer and fear your soul is hiding
In a body which does not deserve to exist
Because he was betrayer of you

The crow will hunt you to the end of the world
It will yake your soul to destroy you
Full of pain and torture it will fall with your soul
And die in an endless wood of shadows(Instrumental)Under a Night of Evil Spells we were born,
And now under the Banner of Ares we fight,
Setting Fire to the Forests,
Moon is turning red,
From the far Lands of the Empires,
To the Fields of Chaos,
Night will show its glowing eyes,
Until Doom there will bring us,

To the North!
To the North!
To the North!
To the North!

In the North is growing an incomparable Power,
Made of Impervious Shadows and Claws,
And beside this Storm its Army will come,
To shutter Thy Realm,
So the Hope to achieve the Apocalypse grows,
To return at the Primitive Chaos,
To go on finding what we're searching,
And then Die with Honour,

To the North!
To the North!
To the North!
To the North! 

Despair Mortals, for the Black Gods we rise!internal soft winds 
carry a black flame 
the innermost strife 
a struggle of will - to life 

with heavy limbs and empty hearts 
trodding onwards, embracing dark 
the inner motions remain 
divine and distant, in silence 
for the inner self is unresting 
unwanted, yet ever craving 
with solemnity it remains lonely 

gone is all ambition 
lifeless is the shell 
divine gifts have perished 
truth has overwhelmed us 

the essence is drained 
innermost sanctums are lost 
barren rocks to reign 
over empty realms 

gone is all ambition 
lifeless is the shell 
divine gifts have perished 
truth has overwhelmed usEndless night
Blood on mouth
Bloodred moon
At the sky
Forest around us

Of cursed souls

Black hateful metal

Legions of evil
Heirs to the tradition
Have risen forever
To conquer
And fight

Of eternal fight
Will never vanish
Burning hot in hearts
And dark minds

Towards victory
Our weapons
War and suffer
In our minds
Dwells the fight

Walking among the ruins
Of this world we
Will be proud
It's our work of art!

Black hateful metal(Instrumental)Join the brave mighty warriors
On a land everfrost
Through a dead black horizon
We shall struggle and toil

No escape for the weak
In desolate empty mourn
Green, the vast ocean coldness
An embrace fighting for...

I will dare this lonely sea
With the power of the North
We shall rise from the bottom deep
Magic of return...

Raven North... Raven Lord
Raven North... Raven Lord
Madness hymns... to shine in the night!

We travelled far on our ships
Spreading chaos, death and blood
Ancient rhymes, forces of sin
Left behind our pagan soil

Majesty crushing death
Like a spell on our souls
A fullmoon, purple horizon
Hear on the wind at the mighty wolf

Fighting giants on the cliff
With fire blanding swords
Never heear the cries of fear
Our future lies beyond...

Raven North... Raven Lord
Raven North... Raven Lord
Madness hymns... to shine in the night!

Now the light is burning bright
To see the world
An illusion came to face
This sacred steel(Instrumental)Born in the war time

Lyrics by IpseSleeping giant awake
stir before the sunrise
shed the years of neglect
from your chamber in the hills
cast off your cloak of sleep
feel the warmth caress your skin
the herald of your reprise
sleeping giant arise!

Arise! arise! shake off your earthly disguise
arise! arise! sleeping giant arise!
Arise! arise! return from eternal demise
Arise! arise! sleeping giant arise!

From the lake in which you bathe
the reflection in your eyes
time for your work to be done
march onward through the rain
wash the dirt of millenia away
walk towards the new light
the dawning of a new day
oh! arise!

Remember the words of your kin
the dreamless and the proud
voices from the past
that call your name again
forgotten words of hope
the promises and the lies
defiant with dignity
oh! arise!They tried to kill my eyes
But they will get fire and burn

Only the ashes of your world
Shall remain for ever sterile
For the dead will make sure
That nothing grows again.

Make me blind and I swear
I will burn your world down
And if I shall perish on fire
I would rise as Phoenix

AS THE Phoenix just flies
To burn you at the stake,
Endlessly

Killing, Killing, Kill my eyes

And as the dead shall rise
To walk on your ashes
They shall trample your remains
And the memories I have of you
Shall vanish.

Make me blind and I swear
I will burn you world down
And if I shall perish on fire
I would rise as Phoenix

And as the dead shall rise
To walks on your ashes
My soul shall be purified from that typical folly

As heaven is on my side
As my faith is boundless
Light shall pierce my eyes again
And my tears shall clean the pain

Make me blind and I swear
I will burn your world down
And if I shall perish on fire
I would rise as Phoenix(Instrumental)My Native Faith

I was born from Slavonic blood
Slavia is my land and my home
Is my fatherland
Where my forefathers ashes lying
Where spilled seas of sweat,tears and blood
Ages of history,hum of trees
Gust of Strzybog winds
Waving sea, fields of cereal
Im son of Sun
Worshipper of highest fire and thunder
What flashes noisy on the sky 
Worshipper of Blood, what is in my veins
My faith burns in my soul 
Its unrestrained Will, to fight and to live
That is penetrateing evrything,evry survival
Universe fertlize by power of creation
Its power of my almighty Gods
My faith is a secret of constant progress 
Its a proud essence of my aryan race
Its a power what pushing for action
Its a holy monument of Swietowit
Its a art,tradition and culture of my folk
Its a holy book of principles and laws
Its a path of honour and strenght
Its a flaring fire in my heart
My faith is eternal voice of cosmic laws
Its a battle song of my harsh Gods
Sweet huming of my goddesses
My fatih lives inside of me, and will  in my  offsprings
Is eternal like Sun,fire and Slavonic FolkWhere the firs and their eternal dreams guard the cursed forest
often I hear the ghastly whispers under the veil of midnight skies

there the spirits silently dance in the dead of night
with them through the mist I soar 
to meet the moon so cold
and in the depths of the dark woods blizzards sing their songs 

the witch and the raven from the fallen snow
weave the net of sorcery 
and the wind it wails and cries like the souls of the dead shout
in the snowy crown of those ancient oaks among the images 
of ancient godsQuenching the Roman hunger
The bloated worms are here,
To gorge upon our children
And the dunghill to our fears

The dreamless sleep of death
And the frozen hand of Nero
In misty trails of blood
As never seen before

Embraced,
With death's disrobing hands
Our thirsting souls
We sacrifice
As cold as mouldering clay
Our remains will become
Shadows of time

To drink from sorrow's chalice
The dregs of malignant hate
We walk on broken eagles
At the foot of death's black gates

Ahead the dark red smoke
Behind untrodden snow
This battle will be fought
And no one will ever know

In memory we will descend
In awe-creating guise
Will anyone ever recall
The lost great British tribesThe mysteries of Europe's soil
is boiling like our blood
beneath the grim grey skies of war
we march in rain and mud

Ancient runes guide us!
In the fight against the armies of the enemy

Burn, Israel, Burn!

We've come to slay the enemy
with rites and acts of war
in ancient times of heathen divine
we slay the hebrew whore

Ancient runes guide us!
the gods of our blood

Burn, Israel, Burn!The wind is blowing
But I can't tell from where
I see paper rustling
The dust that's in the air
I'm fixed on something
Where I'm going, where I've been
And all the while feeling
The air grow thin

I feel it coming
Like a wild rain
The tempest is upon me
Just another link in the chain
I feel it coming
Like a wild rain
The tempest rises

I feel an unease
Settling over me
A virus, a disease
It's unhinging me
I hold onto nothing
Where I have gone, where I have been
And all this time knowing
I'll do it all again

I feel it coming
Like a wild rain
The tempest is upon me
Just another link in the chain
I feel it coming
Like a wild rain
The tempest rises

See the darkened eyes
That signal an end
To every ray of hope
Can you comprehend
Beyond the darkness
Do you remember when
You once looked to hope
But now feel condemned

I feel it coming
Like a wild rain
The tempest is upon me
Just another link in the chain
I feel it coming
Like a wild rain
The tempest rises
And devours me(Instrumental)I know a land
Deep in the north
A place for men of iron

Darkness and light
Power and might
The inner conflict solved as a circle
An ancient rice of supernatural sight
Into a spiritual worlds disguising miracle
Of death and of life
Of eternal strife
For strength and wisdom
And for to survive

And trough fire and ice they were formed,
Through a life that was a struggle...

Supernal
Infernal
Internal arising
While the south is disguising
The nordic titans stood strong and proud

The voice of winter
The voice of woods
The voice of a land,
Where snow and ice are never gone

In ancient times
In the ancient empire
In the time as snow covered the hyperboream soilAbove man out of our control 
Never rests, feel it darkening my soul 
Creating wings of bone and marrow 
Leave this earth, let everything go 

You know I'm superstitious 

I'm wasting away, day after day 
Death is by my side 

Something born apart from this earth(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Pieces that melting slowly deep in my soul
Traces burning the soil showing where we'd to go
Credence - you trusted me that I will take you back home
Remembrance - so many years of silence are gone
I held you in my arms

What brought me this fire in me
My pride that took you far from here
Pieces of darkness raging and stabbing my heart
Traces burning the soil showing where we'd to fall
Sarless was the night then when we had to part
The secrets still unveiled they spark with no voice
I held you in my arms

What brought me this fire in me
My pride that took you far from here

And I lost my sanity
Though I cannot hear the words that ruin meEn ukjent stemme kalte
Fra taarnet hvor ingen bodde
Fra bortenfor skogen
Hvor intet levde
Et rop i droemmen saa skjoent
Som stemmen til dronningen av natten
Vi vaaknet og saa maanen
Delvis dekket av dystre skyer
Det var kaldt og vaatt
Paa vaar ferd inn i riket
Av ufoedte tanker
Endelig kan vi se hva som kalte
For vi fulgte den stemmen in natt...At the pagan sunrise
When sky is red ablaze
This is no time for sadness
Sword are raised in awe

Boldly standing against the tide
Denounce the semite god
Old ways are still trodden
Forever heathen hearted

We will march to war
Under the watchful guide
Our ancestors over-seeing
From the rainbow bridge

Death may come our way
Only to return our bodies to earth
In spirit we are immortal
Living in our people's blood

This is our heritage
Once submit to holy swords
But we will never surrender
Victory will be ours!Eyes of Thunder watching me
Roaring storms are riding over the land
Howling gods cleave the air

Middle ages born again
Horses dashing through battlefields
I am drinking blood of Thousands
For the mighty celebrate

Liar sanctuaries burning shadows
Glows over my head
Shining blades striking down
Bring Havoc and Revive

Words by unholy suripture
Thundering the fullmoon sky
We are sacrifice the liars
Liars for the mighties

Our souls shall fly again
Back to the land of the ancient gods
Between the hills out of the mist
We shall hear just the screams of the holies

Liar sanctuaries burning shadows
Glows over my head
Shining blades striking down
Bring Havoc and Revive...Havoc and Revive!One who waits in mysterious land
He can see Seven Rains
Come with me let me show you the way
I'll take you away
And now you've gotta be afraid
Seven Rains of Fire

Look at me and you'll see my crown
I'm the king on the run
I am rich, I am poor, I am dead
I will show you my land
And there you've gotta be afraid
Seven Rains of Fire
I make me up now I am there
Now I don't care
I'm really here I'm really there
So why do you stare?
It's time to tell what do I want
You're waiting for
So let us go to move the hills
To show what you have got really to fear
Seven Rains of Fire
They're watching you
Na-na-na I'm a prince of a dark
I'm a king of a light which of us doesn't fight...
Every night that I cannot sleep
I try to see in my telescope
There I see that the planets come down
I look around na-na-na-na-na-na
Light of light and the dark of dark
And the rain of rain and this pain in the brain
But they're watching you
And they're watching me
And they're watching us
And they're watching everyone
Seven Rains of Fire
They're really watching youHe was little known until he died
'Cuz the real demons were behind his eyes
And his tortured mind could never thought
Of the extent his mental health had wrought
A dozen shitty movies only two I saw
At least one song by Metallica
Aleister Crowley even believed that crap
You fucked my mind H. P. Lovecraft
You started writing for Wierd Tales
All you wanted was sex you got strait hell
I stole my first from Waldenbooks at the mall
And then I heard Cthulhu's Call
Other writer jumped on your boat
Even you weren't scared of what you wrote
You told of monters lurking in the mist
'Cause you daddy died of syphilisRaise your swords!
Kill the infidels
the one who stand by the cross

"Hypocrites of their weak faith, infidels of the bastard god shall be condemmed in the rivers of the underworld for their betrayel and mischief to the gods"

All abnormal is decadence
the most decadent humanspecies is the priest:
But you can't debate with him, cause only his death is the solutionI've seen the light 
at the end of dark 
it showed me what 
is the lie and what is the truth 

I know the truth 
rising up from the mud 
which wants to help us in 
fight against spiritual dogmas 

I felt the death 
learned the price of pain 
of an innocent dying soul 
under the oppression of mess 

feeling this sorrow 
given by god's creation 
I'll never know 
what they believe in 

how many lives you want? 
to whom will it be your palliation 
jesus christ died on the cross 
symbol of his pain is shield of your power 
who is the owner of that guilt 
of thousands burned to death 
for heresy to fill up 
the bags of their inquisitors 

I saw the light 
at the end of the dark 
it showed me what 
is the lie and what is the truth 

feeling this sorrow 
given by god's creation 
I'll never know 
what they believe in(Instrumental)3. The Evening Lights

Our legions drink and insult
Their holly fucking victims
The wood's cross is dead
As hundred of her believers
Tonight we sing under the moon
Tomorrow we take again our swords
We believed against Christianity
No victory on their god
But on the battlefields, with ours
Tonight we sing under the moon
For our deads, horn's raised
Full of liquors and alcohol(Instrumental)What is lost from the times of elders wisdom?
So many unrevealed secrets...
enemy has buried them in deep depths of their rotten souls...
Is there a time for a new awakening

To feel hatred
to feel anguish
its like you live in eternal pain (yet I desecrate them all)
To hate my enemies
to make them suffer and bleed
that is what I creed and in the end is my joy...Blue Ichar! No corners!
Read Frank Belknap Long instead of eating food
With a Name like Frank Belknap Long It's got to be good
Turn away from the horror lest ye surely go mad
Frank gives you every tentacle and severed hand
And Others Shall Be Born!
The Hounds of Tindalos!
Mastered the mythos, wrote horrific poems
H. P. got him a slot on the amazing staff
On to tread the path laid by LovecraftGil Galad was a elf king
The last with a kingdom of beauty and free
Between the mountains and the seas
He lived for a long time
Nobody knows where he goes
The stars fall in the darkness
From Mordor where the shadows live(Instrumental)In Shining Armour
In shining armour you stand, disease while sleeping and fury alive. Pure in harmony with chaos the image of truth, the image of love. See the face of the new god, make his way into your blood. Our almighty new god, turning man back into mud. 

Even though candles of hope may still burn, even though earth is still fertile and turn. Nothing compares to beauty you hold, you bring out the new and burn all the old. 

In shining armour you stand, disease while sleeping and fury alive. Pure in harmony with chaos the image of truth, the image of love. See the face of the new god, make his way into your blood. Our almighty new god, turning man back into mud. 

The mightiest warlord now offering peace, your presence unnoted as tension decrease. Never have there been a god such as you of limitless power and actually true. 

In shining armour you stand, disease while sleeping and fury alive. Pure in harmony with chaos the image of truth, the image of love. See the face of the new god, make his way into your blood. Our almighty new god, turning man back into mud.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The time to consumed
The forces to live
Living each and every day
And I don't know...
[What's the meaning of life]

My heart and my thoughts
Are stronger than this existence
Without something believe in
Just in me...

"As we die in the rain
That runs out of my eyes
As we die in the dark
That comes out of my heart"The soul's journey leads to death
Locked into a cage of bones and flesh
Subject to development
Broken in the road to death
Which is short for some
But long for others
Joy, sorrow, pain

Exposed to a number of emotions
This development is inevitable
Irreversible process
This is a mission without a second chance
With the passing of time our souls take shape

The flesh rots
Bones pulverise
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the time comes
My soul will be released from its cage
With a final breathFailing in a modern time
Growing up from my fears
Help up by my suffering
A dying child is born to the aspects of life

We live in negativity where only dreams can bring us hope
And now the reality sets in...
This ever growing mass of melancholy has overtaken my mind
And I've lost all control and touch

As i wept under the moon and rainy sky
I felt the great and vast nothingness deeply in my heart

I can't understand why I've tried so hard
To make myself more than a man...

And as i sit here awaiting my death 
I cry to the stars and midnight sky
That my heart is dead and cold

I will miss it when by body's dead and gone
I will miss it when we part

Karmgeddon- Guitars and Drums
Hrodvitnisson- Lyrics and VocalsThree days of absolute eclypse 
Introduce the evoked tribunal 
Hailstorms proof, they told us the truth 

Total destruction, mankind to hell 
Blind and insane the misguided repent 
But it's a bit late... 

In the heat of infernal lightnings 
And in the shadows of poisoned clouds 
The world will die under the sword of destiny 

Go out and see, the omens are here 
A church is red like blood of an angel 
The rich and the poor, both will fall into the 
flames of malice...(Instrumental)I awoke to horrifying screams and terrible dreams
I had made the thoughts in my mind come to reality
As i slept it became a more vivid dream

Almost a tangible reality
I have never lived to my full potential

These were the moans and cries of the past
The black cloud took me and i was never the same

Alone i stood amongst the black figured bodies
And i felt no rear, no regret, nothing

The horrendous calls echoed throughout me
These are the poems of the shadows disappointment

Hrodvitnisson- Lyrics and VocalsChernobog (Div)
                          Black clouds in heaven
                    Ravens fly to the valley of rites,
                       Chernobog has to be invoked
                       To color in black your life
                        Paganpriest make the rite
                     Rite of blackgods, rite of pagan
                   Blood flows through heaven with rain
               Chernobog flies on wings of the black bird,
                      Black sorcery starts to begin
                       Ancient memory rising in us
                        To kill the Jehova & Jesus
                         Dusted tombs are opened,
                      Ancient deads walk to the Div,
                        And the Christ we killed,
                      And the blood flows from wind
                        Mourning screams of Christ
                             Ran over valley,
              Div killed them, and the soul of pagan wake up
                         Fate of Christ is killed
                    And we fly with Div in the sky...Towards thy end you wander
Stumbling throughout the mist
Coursed like the hunter's prey
Your senses feel distorted
Shrouded by intense fear
All alone in this final hour

Abandon all hopes for spare
Face your justice, time has come

The string of life is yet cut
At the place where blood is shed
The death of betrayers is so close
No honour, no pride shall be

Within the circle of spears
The thunder cracks the sky
A fury of lightning and fire
Announcing the forthcoming rite

The blade cuts your flesh
Tears apart the back
Now Gaping to the last
The lungs are ripped
Forming your new limbs

Winged like an eagle of blood
Awaiting the sign to rise
While your soul passes away
Forever leaving this world
The caverns of hel are near
Cold glowing landscapes
Longing for your arrival
Carried by the blood eagle(Instrumental)Our hollow bones, mere flutes to the wind
Once learnt, all roads lead to ruin
Pathways they become overgrown
We all once bow to the same tone

Shreds of will and shreds of faith
Devoured by rust are blade and plate
The night's hunger for dying light
Draws to shadows the remains of life

Fading the echo of eight hoove's gait
Ears stay deaf to every new tale
In birth we are draped in death's grey veil
Forced to follow the shadowed trail

Return to earth to dream and decay
Forget this march of fear and fey
For soon your strength will fail and break
Soon your life's weak flame shall fade(Instrumental)Wild winds cut the sea
into black abyss
depths of endlessness
they await for us

Hands from nothingness
try to stop the ship
prayer to our gods
waters boil with greed

Take a look to the endless shores
beaten by the stormy waves
home's so near and so apart
will we all see the morning sun?

Life now passes by
streams of moments gone
eyes so sorrowful
watching down the sea

Cold stare to the sky
Blackness all around
Fate's not on our side
Seems this is the End

Take a look to the endless shores
beaten by the stormy waves
home's so near and so apart
will we all see the morning sun?

Voices of the damned
Doomed to sing our end
Wild wind cut the see
into black abyss(Instrumental)MERACAU KEGALAUAN, AKU BERSANDAR DILEMA

THE SOUND OF SILENT WILL GET ME FAR... AWAY FROM HERE...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)DESOLATED BATTLEFIELDS

I came to my village
and all my identity it is lost.  
Death pain and destruction 
Carried by the vultures of the cross. 
 
Will,  honour  and respect....  
Envenomed by  Christian lies.  

Honor, strength and glory
They are all next to die

What has happened?...
My family is death...
Houses are in fire
The ground is crimson red

I walk against the wind in this desolated battlefield
I cry and I  scream, someday they will pay for all of this
Father!
 I can hear you 
crying
 for our land.

Everything is lost
Now our banner is ash
I see the thunderbolt
while the sky turns black

Dragging the blood of this fields
Like a sacred river it flows

I walk against the wind in this desolated battlefield
I cry and I scream, someday they will pay for all of this

I sink my hands 
in this land,
my fatherland  
will be cleaned with my tears.

....Vengeance....  
....My sword is thirsty of your blood....I inquire of the wind: why do you blow? 
I inquire of the see: why do you rustle and froth? 
I inquire of the Earth: why do you turn, 
breathe and cry? the candles burn 
the heart throb. I ask myself 
why am I alive? if I surely die, what will happen? 

alone, with my feelings 
I will lie down in a coffin... 

I what meanwhile live in aggresive age, wait 
till me someone lost, will be discovered... 

alone, with my feelings 
I lie down in a coffin... 

and the wind blows, and the see rustles further 
and Earth turn, breathe and cry...Hail be thee, born in a lost age
Life was how it was meant to be
But I am not as fortunate
And was born in an age where everything is terribly wrong
No one seems to notice
Nor do they care

Shown in infinite wisdom and truth
The Ancient Way did they follow
The only way known to them
No confusion or mistruth did they see
Only purpose and understanding

Brotherhood and tribal love
Basking in moonlight's glow
Standing on a cliff over a rising tide
These are the things that meant the most to them
But they are lost
Lost in a vast sea of time(Instrumental)Sounds of the sea take my soul
Beyond the mountains
I do know the secret where I am
I am from the distant lands
Where the fire is my throne
And the sword is god
Created by the ancient
And taken for great battles
Created by the ancient
And taken for great battles
I have discovered my history, my origin
And my time
Time will not come back
Time that i've not enjoyed
But I know who I am now
I came from the land where rules

On the throne the devastating folkoon sword
Warriors are displayng the standarts of our reign
This reign where the tyranny will never know it cause we're worthy, we were born to protect the honor
Sons of fire, of the earth, water and air
I am your son
I've come with sounds of the sea
Beyond the mountains
Know who I am
Beyond the mountains
Know who I am
I'm son of folkoon
Blow with rage about the unworthy
Future those that come
Tear the flesh out those condemn us
And we'll burn their mortal remains
We are sons...
We came by sound of the sea
Beyond the mountains
Hail! those that come!
Born to defender the honor
Sons of fire, of the earth, water and air

Beyond the mountains
The winds howl and the circle is not broken
The winds howl and the circle is not broken
Beyond the mountains

Sons of the sea take my soul
Beyond the mountains
I do know the secret where I am
I am from the distant lands
Where the fire is my throne
And the sword is god...
Created by the ancient!Sky turned red
Tears in my eyes
I see the gates of Heaven
Take me up to see my Life
I need to hear my lament
Lowering clouds
The Gods I hail
I drink my wine at last time
My last breathe
I'm ready to come
To the kingdom of the EERIE...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hate suffer

Wheel of torture 
Endless death

Fatal sadness

For all eternity 

Crave lust beg crawl 
Frigid cold of the human tomb

Hate sufferfar from home a child was born
to be Athens' king he was grown
his mother told to find the sword
which was to prove and which he caught

he started the journey to the throne
and broke the bandits all their bones
like Zeus' son he wanted to fight
like him to be the people's knight

he killed a robber with his mace
the other earned a tree embrace
he killed boar and deceitful host
in people's heart there was his post

then his mind was full of doubt
in his head were his victims shouts
"I am guilty", was his thought
but at least catharsis was brought

he reached the town his father ruled
father and son were together
then the seperation came, cruel
the son left to make it better

with young men he entered the boat
full of sadness, the sails were black
so he went his destined road
white shall it be when he gets back

Atheneans were sent to die
in caves under Minos' castle
it was Cretes' monster's place to hide
built by Daedalos, a marvel

in enimies land he found love
she gave him items to complete
he mastered dark missions path
so Minos only gained defeat

woman and warrior left the place
together they flew to Athens
and with them all imprisoned men
Theseus and his girl in embrace

it seemed they won everything
but then he had to leave his wife
but there was no sense in strife
alone he sailed to home and king

is he alive?
is he dead?
a fathers burden / Where are you?
sons legacy / Theseus!

what should be white kept being black
father and king saw the wrong sail
he fell to death his face turned pale
returned as a hero but nothing leftI've crossed the plains , slept in deep woods
I've talked with wolves on the secrets of the mountain
an ancient evil , ealking the earth
is haunting his enemy , his nemesis eternal
in the calm of the waater , that mirrors the white moon,
I await the day i'll take my sword again
In the forest is running the winterdemon followed by a storm that kills every life form

Secrets of past never told before , are awaiting for their summoning

In the darkest places , under mighty mountains , is the spirit of an ancient warrior of the north...
he remembers the battles , so great and so hateful
where he brokess bones and drunk blood from the skulls
like a black shadow , he was cast by the moon , and by revenge that he wants on humanity
pale eyes , and long hairs , white skin and lips naked in the woods
lies the spirit of the past!

chroonicles of divine , misanthropic devastation
mutilated and sliced bodies are all bleeding and slowly rotting , and the cracked head of priest make me laugh for all the time,  so I take a fucked cross and use it for the final blow

Secrets of past never told before , are awaiting for their summoningBegone, darkness of Christ
Your image is swept away
A new dawn arises
Today, the light is reborn

The shining one returns
out of the kingdom of Hell
To bring everlasting light
to this world we call ours

As darkness crumbles for the light
so will the Christian cross perish
behold the splendour of the reborn
the glory of Baldur will prevail
no longer are we your slaves
our chains fall broken to the ground
all the righteous will rejoice
as the solar weel is restored
the rule of the unjust is over
we crown Wuotans son as our king

We smash their swords
and trash their shields
we drown them in the bog
an offering to the gods

The shining one returns
out of the kingdom of Hell
To bring everlasting light
to this world we call ours

As they scream in pain
and terrible torment
we take back what is ours
for centuries to comeNoumenon, embrace of 
Sorrow and weariness... 
Cold, narrow, despicable life 

Chime the age 
Of negativity 

Absent is hope, and with it failure 
A solidified dogma of immanence 
Precautious scepticism 
Devoutly inhaled 

Hark, 
The chime of negativity 
Reverberates life 

Bleakness, despair 
Recurring, devouring 

To capture nature 
Is merely to grasp 
That we are nothing but 
A moldy film on a 
Congealed, cold crust(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Black heart of snow
Tell me secrets
Of the forgotten
Who lived before

Father cursed his sons
Daughters were left to die
Cult of frost and hate
The great winter shall come

Mighty odin of thousand swords
Do you know the name of mine?

Yes, my son
I shall know your name
And your prophecies of winter

There shall come great winter
And it will last three times more
It is called the fimbulvetr
Spreading frost and coldness

I rule the frost
I damn the earth
I curse the sun
I walk with odin

I am the night, the dreams of moon
I cast the spells and fly in mist
My emperors, their kingdom come
Thou art forever dressed in black

Towards the cold my children run
To make the winter eternal
I dream of hate until forever
The nightwinds spread my prophecy(Instrumental)I see the valkyries fly
High through the sky
So very high
Now I know it is my time to die
So I shall walk into battle with the head held high
And my sword if fist I go
To conquer all the mighty foes
This will be the end of me
Time to start my legacy(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Everything toward the death

Lempo! God of evil and lord Demons

"Head of the demons"...
Be may also be an evil triad, with evil spirits (Demons)
Husi and Paha (closely by his side).

O' thou god of wickedness, confusion and cruelty (the ancient god of love).
Let thy forces weaken the lambs of the cross!
Hear my deepest call... Crush the forces of Christ, let the lambs to be slaughtered
Devastate the chistianityThe infinity of blackness calms me
I feed in its embrace 
It makes me strong
Gives me powers beyond life
I'm in a womb-son of darkness
My throne be the womb
As my unborn soul is eternal

Mother eat the light
Raise me in forever black night.
And so I swear
Never to leave this dark
My kingdom of hate

Emptiness between the stars 
Black nothing of eternal night
Granter of unlife-mother of silenced souls 
Sator-Saturnus-Sathanas

I will never be born
Forever embryo of blackness
I inherit the hate 
That dissolves the light and blackens the stars
In my kingdom of night
Beginning of time never was and never will be 
For I was there
And forever am.(Instrumental)They come from the sea
From far beyond
Their ships bite the rumbling
Waves of none

Like a tide that hurls 
against the rocks
like an eagle on it's prey
They're marching on

Allies are now distant from here
And the battle's coming as a plague
From the top of this fortress
We're screaming again

Sons of evil we'll never surrender 
with courage we will break
This ancient curse
From houses to temples
Surrounded by terror that's
Creeping inside
But the remains 
will recall our Fate
They'll bring our fate back

16.000 come to die
In nine days of bloody
Odd resistance made in vain
We sing about an age's end

Mother! Take me home
Death! Take me away

Allies are now distant from here
And the battle's coming as a plague
From the top of this fortress
We're screaming again

Sons of evil we'll never surrender 
with courage we will break
This ancient curse
From houses to temples
Surrounded by terror that's
Creeping inside
But the remains 
will recall our Fate
They'll bring our fate back(Instrumental)Listen to the thunder shake the hills,
awaken not the giants who sleep to still.
As the lightning through the storm,
through your hearth may be so warm,
theres a fire which rages within.

And the song may not waken me,
and the strong may threaten me,
stood so long against the wind and rain.
Where the ravens fly so high,
where the Earth caress the sky,
I shall climb to the ancient gods who reign.

I hear the mountain call my name,
awake the hearts of those who will remain,
these ancient ones will e'er reside
and they call for me to enter the mountainside.

Listen to their whisper in your heart,
so loud it tears your mind and soul apart.
To the faithfull ever clear,
to the brave it brings no fear.
Theres a river which rages within.

Though long may the journey seem,
though life may seem just a dream,
and the wolves may be many in the night,
when the gods ignore my cry,
when my foes wish me to die,
I will never give up the will to fight.

I hear the mountain call my name,
awake the hearts of those who will remain,
these ancient ones will e'er reside
and they call for me to enter the mountainside.

The mountainside...The mountainside...The mountainside...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Inner lock surrounded by a freedom fiction
Brutal war against the pure wisdom notion
True nature of human race
In history is deeply hidden
Real aspect of human race
By instincts
Will be revealed
The moral
Has been blinding
What human
Has needed to feel
Invisibles wounds of wrong conscience
Engraved in entrails
Guilty of being
Savage assault of religious principles
Throws the shame on humanity
Hey, can't you make a choice?
Will you let the key in the hands of god
Or take it and try to live by yourself?
Break this inner lock or it will break you!
Savage assault of religious principles
Throw the shame on humanity
Turn over your eyes to find
The crypt within lives the passion's bride
Over your skulls a key is floating in the sky
Try to reach it until your blood gets dry...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Cold whirlwinds 
Scatter death-yellow leaves on the ground
The moon has shown 
It's pale muzzle from the black clouds
Wolfs are howling far in the woods
And blood get colder in veins
The sight of burning stars 
Penetrates through your soul 

In The Frightful Wallachian Woods
Evil whispering in the midnight
In the Frightful Wallachian Woods
Unvoiced shouts sound from darkness

The writhed branches of trees as 
if hands of the dead 
Lasting to you in a moonlight
Wishing to tear apart your throat
Ugly trunks silently whisper damnations 
To you 

Evil rules the forest
Malefic spells of forgotten past
Children of the poisoned swamps
And wolfish womb thirst for your blood
In a thickets where spirits of witches 
Celebrating their masses
Cold air will strangle 
Your desperate shout

Werewolves are haunting prey in a fog
Red burning eyes and canines in blood
Shades of the night flying beasts
Flashing above your head
Mischievous laughter of an old raven
Echoed ominously in your ears
And forest haze above the cold lakes
Drags you in its ice waters

Demons of night torment your getting cold body 
and choking in mad laughter
Spirits of woods taking away your dying soul 
With themselves in impassable thickets

In The Frightful Wallachian Woods
Evil summoning in the midnight
In the Frightful Wallachian Woods
Unvoiced shouts sound from darkness
In The Frightful Wallachian Woods
Witches' spirits rule the sabbath
In The Frightful Wallachian Woods
Shifting shadows on a fog clothWe are back again , the storm wind from the south
And we are much stronger than before
We will ride again, against all Christian will
And large in number we are now

We are the stones, we are hard and cold
We are the water running down the hills
We are the falling leaves, the clouds in th sky
The dark forest and all it's trees

Refrain:
"This is our mission, this is our destiny
Ths is our will this is our fate
This is the desire of a wolf!

Under the banner of wolves we ride and strike
With voices of thunder and like a storm wind in the night
These are the hymns of our battle
We will stand wild and free"

See all our flags, we all are united now
See all our pride, see how strong we will strike

Storm wind and fire all filling the sky
The hordes of wolves are raging tonight
With cries freesing blood and wrath in their eyes
This bound renewed again at this time

Lift up all the banners, be proud and be strong!
Lift up all the banners, victory comes to us all!

RefrainIt has been sleeping for centuries and centuries
In R'LYEH it resides forced by sleep
By them who want to reject the eternal obscurity
And they want to fight the human fate

Human destiny is graven
It will arise
It will fight the ancient master and will tear the
Human souls!

Earth will meet the night when sunrise will be dark
YOG-SOTHOTH knows the seven gates
When stars will be faded and moon will never shine
Everything from deep will burn through a bleeding sky

Human destiny is graven
It will arise
It will fight the ancient master and will tear the
Human souls!

The creature re-appears from darkness

They will come back
And the gates will be opened

It has been sleeping for centuries and centuries
In R'LYEH it resides forced by sleep
By them who want to reject the eternal obscurity
And they want to fight the human fate

Human destiny is graven
It will arise
It will fight the ancient master and will tear the
Human souls!Where the sun
Setting in a stratos clouds?
Where the sea
Resting to the unknown shores?
Strong waves? running by the will of wind
Endless waves, up to blending of sky and sea

Handful of ground
Taken from my Motherland
So stern so cold
As all the her sons
Here the rocks
Where I've walk in childhood
But the waves
Calls me follow them in path

Blood of snows
Melting under warm spring sun
Gave to drink
To the ocean under my keel
Blood of men
Spilled by our swords
Fade away
Taken as gift by grateful seaKids who kill (2x)

Life's a badlam, misunderstood children

Dangerous minds with intention to kill

Harmless appearance hiding cruel desires

Young psychopath in a perfect disguise

Chorus:

Raped from their own blood-twisted thoughts (2x)

Resulting from barbaric sexual intercourse

Impulse to kill starts with slaying birds

Beating my brother, picking the dog

Traumatic experiences with horrifying consequence

"I have to kill! You are all my enemies

Let me be and you may live

But don't be sure, shozophrenic habit

One mixture nice, the other bad

Bloodlust in your eyes"

Inner might forces you to take up the knife and to strike

Voices in your head reminding of memories

That'llforever remain inside your brain

"You like to come with Daddy?"I'll do you no

Harm, so please trust me" Ruled by perverse

Tendencies, not able to overcome this urge for infantile sex.

Chorus

"Daddy, keep away from me, I love you

But not this way, please don't hurt me"

Traumatic experiences with horrifying consequence

Pain and mental agony never to be healed again

Perpetual damage leading to kill

Psychological conflict

Kids who kill(2x)(Instrumental)Speak of great things and gather
Despite wind
Despite light
Despite fear
Sun of light
Sun of birth
Beneath the light we are icons of filth
Icons of filth
We are icons of filth

Speak of great things and gather
Tasting dust
Eating dirt
Crushing fear
Moon of light
Moon of birth
Beneath the light we are icons of filth
Icons filth
We are icons of filth

The black side
While they scream in despair
Lose hope and resign
Be despondent
Be demoralized

Vandalized ashes
Destuction of saints
Look on the black side
In your emotional state of despair
With harsh words they send you 
To the depths of despair
With filth they s\urround you
Gathered and vandalized

Look on the black side
Lose hope and cry
With filth we all gather
Crippled beneath the icons of filthA historical inversion, led to total devastation.
A false creation, from a mad imagination.
With the "Ancients' proudness" and the strength of Darkness.
There's a reason for someone, to gain the power to become The One.Lyric by Triumphsword

Mists cover our lands
In the darkness of our forests
Pagan obscure celebrations worshipping
The night of our winter

Old spirits acclaim for the eternal  power
Old spirits of the lands of the south

The magic symphony of the moon
The magic pagan war
Of the supreme south
Worshipping the night where pagan gods sing

The sound of their swords
The frozen symphony that echoes in our lands

Old spirits acclaim for the eternal power
Old spirits of the lands of the south

In the middle of the misanthropic forests
The spirits celebrate the lands of the southAngel : "I see your face
Staring at the wall
It's cold and dark
And you face your donwfall
It is you!!!!!!
The faces of the demons are forever
emprinted in my mind, although my sight is taken.
What I've created is a neverending pain.
It disgraces my human form.
But I'll never have regret for what I've done.
It brings me joy !
Portraits of my acts will be vreated and I will
never be out of the thoughts of humans.
The demons I know
Bring me down
It's no human soul
That wears the crown
And so I await my trial in this draft, dark cell.
But I know it's necessary to hold the evil down.
I'm not the only one though who does
something about the world.
We are everywhere, we are your sons and daughters,
we will keep on coming, we salute you
Only the way of the change differs.
Darkness and light still end up the same.
I know my sentence.
The final Episode in my morbid tale.
Highlight in my disturbed fantasy.
Sinner - Bleeding - Justice - ForeverCold is the strand old its soil
Beneath frozen sand
The worm uncoils

Between two stones
Between two worlds
Between writhing bones
Between bodies curled

Bitter is the scent of young
Proud seething elder one
Bite the stone, bite the serpent stone

Between madness and beyond
Call ghosts of the unborn
Hatch the stone, hatch the serpent stone

Gaze held high
Leave the mark
Of fangs and despise
To newborn bark

As shall I gorge the venom
As shall you seize the blood
Strong as defiance comes
While mine is barren and stark

So suffers the slowest of us
And shares all sins of us
Spit on the stone, spit on the serpent stone

Within whole world unmade
Old viper of iron shade
Shed the skin, shed the serpent skin

Deceiveth thou my waning breath
For I have devoured the eternity
Eyes wide blind with hue of death
Knowing the lie of good from evil

So shall I sway,
So shall you crawl,
So shall we trail
The crooked paths of Seithr(Instrumental)(Instrumental)War booty, armour forged by the hands of a craftsman
Harvest and noble presents, trading with loot.
Fragrance and stench everywhere
Abundance of everything you may desire

Heroes from the north-east, sturdy Vikings cunning
Slavs, dogged Saxons, juggler Celts and wild Arabs and Turks, mad pagan dogs.
Highlanders, herdsmen and sea-farers,
Warriors and wandering tradesmen,
Nearly all the scum of the heathen nations

Skirmishes and pleasures, women shameless
Wine and beer and booze, drinks galore,
To your heart's content
With a beggar's stick or wielding a sword, it devil may care.

Now live, tomorrow you'll be struck down;
With a bit of luck you'll die a cow's death in the hay.

Every wolf knows the purpose of his mouth,
Hunted like a marauder, unwelcome murdering beast,
Must be uprooted from his own territory.
The headsman strikes the merciful blow
And pulls the rope for everyone who don't bow down their backs.Oxiayala holado, od zodirome O coraxo das zodiladare raasyo.

Lucifer is calling my name
From the depth of his throat
Down, where the angels fall
As their wings blacken and burn
Fall... burn... Lucifer is calling my name

Down to his belly
Among the stormy winds
Swallowed I'm being
As a fresh scrap of meat
Am I dead or I have to die
When the death plays her melody
Her melody for the end of life

I'll release my sins
I'll let them flow
In this darkening sea
Which this abyss seems to be
Drown... deep... That's his majesty's wish

the cruelst monster broke freeI feel get my feelings rid
Of my me slowly...
The rain fall down from the faces
Filling up my heart with grief

Waiting to heal my wounds
With the passing of time

Like the withered leaf
Which fall from the autumn trees
One second is too much
For the instinct of love

Freezing, waiting the cold wind
Tear it up slowly
Freezing, alone,
Feel now the time fade

Every second in this winter place
It's a crevice in my heart
All that surrounds me has become so sad
The reason to live just has gone off my mind
My empty hands are waiting you...

The time is going on
The life too and I just lie,
Alone in my grave
To me, the world just
Becomes so heavy, so sad

Now, I just have to close
My eyes and forget that...
I lived a tale wo nobody wrote

And I die...Everything has been changed by this eternal feeling...
Wanton like this desire.
Tired and beat, locked in the darkness, standing helpless,
Lonely and uninspired.
Show me what this light is worth!
Tell me what my life is worth!
Long ago when this big world changed
And went all crazy...
In the prime of my life.
I belived if I locked
my soul behind bars then I' d
Be able to bear all the pain
and the strife!
Everything has turned out bad;
There' s nothin' I want more...
If I could see reality
I' d just head straight
out through the door!
Hope keeps me alive...
I' m blinded by the light!
See the new blue sky!!
Hope keeps me alive...
I' m blinded by the light!
Feel the breaking ice!
Things won' t change, or get nice...
STILL it' s much WORSE inside!
Things didn' t change, or get nice...
N' THEY' RE still Worse insideThe night is cold the sky is black
Once I start there's no turning back
Blackened candles are in flame
Give me ligh to recite His name
Hear the tolling of death's bell
When I take you to hell!
The hour strikes we all must rise
The look of fear is deep in your eyes
High priest chants the dagger in his hands
To slice your wrists blood falls in the sand
I have earned my place in Hell
I gave my soul to sell
When I reach the final gate
The fire of Hades will await
I gave my soul to sell so I'm gonna... take you to Hell
Your flesh now burns high on the stake
There's no regrets for this life I must takeEnthroned in slavery, entitled the king
envisaged the lie, envisaged the die
Untoughed but still true?
Unseen but still all around?
Out of this world he hunts, out of this world, 
out of my lands
In mountains I feel, in rivers I heal
Through crystal airs I scream
In woods I dance, along with beasts I dance
Enchanting tunes I cry
To skies I belong, to nights I belong
Earth a forever
home of my body, home of my spirit, 
home of my cursed soul
You don't need the lie, don't need the pain

Reign!!!Reign!!!Reign!!!Reign!!!
They deriding my gods, defounding my temples
In silence I grieve, in silence I won't leave
Enthroned in majesty, Entitled the master
Embracing my hate, embracing my fate
I hail the demon, I invite my demon
In my reign of steel an iron I rule
don't need the lie, don't need the pain
Tonight I built, I fucking built my...
Reign!!!Reign!!!Reign!!!Reign!!!Murder the spectre of humankind!
May the light flash
From the abject open scar
That appears before my eyes

I've become the Unbearable
The man in God's image.
When man hates man,
When bloodshed
Isn't enough to contain hate.
When decadence is all
And your thousands of lives
Resonnate in me
Like a death hymn
When the spectacle of your acts
Soils the ruins of your moral
When your beliefs are only
The foundations of your requiem,
And when the instigators of holy vice
Come to exult and penetrate
Souls with a liberating,
And cynical sigh

"I murder the spectre of humankind
So that the light flash at last
From the abject depravity
That became our world ".. This is a story about Elizabeth Bathori
Her blood is ourselves
Clean Hungarian blood...

Dark castle, occult carol sounds
Women are crying, but they are satisfied
Elizabeth didn't sleep tonight
She exorcized her youth by her own eyes

Dead girls are chaperoning her
On her deadly magic-circle's lines
She pricks needles under the ladies' nails
Their frosty bodies are buried alive

Oh how I love to feel your breath
I'd love to be the lover of death
Desires come ture, coil prayers are heard
By Elizabeth Bathori - the countess of my fire!

You are also sacrifice
You will give your blood
Because she must
Have a bath...

"Welcome my youth
Alike before...
More enormous than ever!
By the blood, by the blood everything are cleaned...
Oh yes I've got the magic... Yes I feel I fly
I fly towards the Moon!"

Countess it is your night
You are haunted by your wild desires
Possessed by bestial lust
You are the goddess of the love

She's got insatiable mind
She needs virgins blood anymore
Her flames never die away
She is surrounded with never-fading gloryPeople say my insanity has taken over me
and some people says that i am a demon

I See the reality through a different look
I hear terrible screams and this amuses me

"Your End is arriving and your kingdom will be strong
Heads roll when my wing head for the darkness
For to each flap of the wing, a Christ's son dies, on behalf of my gods." 

The war is close. The dark inquisition is arriving
together with it, the chaos and the fear of the beholders of Christ 

Ways of tortures and pain are being prepared 
by the name of dark inquisition, may our enemies go down(Instrumental)Hours of boredom alternating 
With short periods of combat 
Sleep with fat rats and vermin 
Live an animal and lethargic life 

The front, a formless landscape, 
Shot with smoking craters 
In the air, atrocious stench of corpses 
Perpetual battle against the elements 

Flows of mud carry away the fillings, 
Changing the trench into an icy sewer 
(2x) 

Suddenly bombardment breaks up 
Lacerating shrapnels specially dreaded 
The shell-fire sometimes so violent 
After this inferno, gather the dead 

Runners carry the reports to the HQ 
?Line cleaners? crawl in no-man?s land 
Slide into the enemy-lines through the night, 
Cut off a throat with the dagger 

Sappers shear the barbed-wire entanglements, 
Dig out tunnels under the enemy-lines 
Finally the hour of decisive attack 
Infantrymen rush out of the trenches 

Trying to penetrate the enemy-device 
Abrupt bursts of gun-fire starting 
Thousands of soldiers in the battle, 
Only a handful reaching the target 

Stab, shoot, hack and kill (3x) 

Throw hand-grenades, jump in the trenches 
Now starts the massacre, brief and terrible 
(2x) 

Stab, shoot, hack and kill (2x) 

Throw hand-grenades, jump in the trenches 
Now starts the massacre, brief and terrible

In a few seconds, it?s all over.In the shades of fire
Fire
The horns are burning behind the highest fire
Fire
The rise of the shadow titan

Thrown 
Into the lake of fire
Gathered
In the glory they ride
Behind the burning shades
It shall rise

I claim fire
Behind the shade of shadows
There in fire
At the gates, beyond
Beyond the fires of the highest horns
There in fire
Behind the shades of shadows

Fire
For false messiahs and false prophets
Fire
Son of hate
Son of glory
Fire
Tormented day and night
Fire
Forever and ever

I claim fire
Behind the shades of shadows
Where's my king
Where's my glory
Glory be
Superior son of hate
I reach for glory
Glory be
There in fire
Behind the shades of shadowsFollow the dusty road
It leads you into the unknown
Sounds from the dark
It calls you
Can you hear it now

[Chorus]
Follow the dusty road
It leads you to the unknown
I am walking the dusty road
The road that no one knows
Can you hear the sound from the dark
It calls you and can you hear it now

It leads you into the unknown
Sounds from the dark
It calls you
Can you hear it now

You're a misogynist. Known as the fascist of the Best Seller list
As you died in pain. You still had to persist 
And make sure everybody knew you were pissed
Wrote about your great great great great Grandson
Only as Larzarus Long could you be that handsome
I swear as sure as your middle name is Anson
I heard you wrote a favorite book of Charles Manson

May all the pagan entities

against the curse of the void

Ancient words and verses
forged with the blood of dedication
for those whose sight shall see

The only faith remaining 
just one thing left to believe
is the truth that is denied by most:
the Green Apocalypse is looming!

Touch the bark and grab the soil
illiterate but skilled survivalist

There, where minds are poisoned

Destruction is imminent

I feel drops on my face
And it's so hot
Something's climbing the walls
Like a rat
Can't pass through border of my room
But I know
This is last chance
To say goodbye to you

Deliver of pleasure
Deliver of sorrow
Believer I've been
Till I realised what's follow
Now I wanna get even
Just settle the score
My personal revenge
Soon will be done

It's time to tear away your vains
It's time to cut your throat my friend
I'll kill you with this broken needle
With pin of fear that's sticking with my hand

Thin ice
Survive
I want to stand up
But still I'm crawling instead
Red light
I'm fighting
With illusions that still roaming through my head

Still feel dirt in my scars
And taste of vomit in my mouth
Crying, tied to my bed
I wish this nightmare came to an end
Who are you to take my dreams away?
Who are you to hold my neck and squeeze my breath?
Who are you to cut my wings and make me beg?
You're god of weak or you just pretend?

Thin ice
Survive
I want to stand up
But still I'm crawling instead
Red light
I'm fighting
With illusions that still roaming through my head

Never
Never
I'll get back to you and this bloody heaven
I leave this shit and spit it out to you

You said it will be our paradise
You said that we can ride the storm
You said that we can grip some stars tonight
But this bloody sky was only lie
Only lie

Lost in cage of self destruction
Trapped in a maze with frozen darkness
Corridor's empty and I can see the light
Bright of day which now I can't deny

It's time to tear away your vains
It's time to cut your throat my friend
I'll kill you with this broken needle
With pin of fear that's sticking
Sticking with my handThe face of a vampire
That grins in the black
It waits,
In the castle cold 
The wings of a demon
That glides in the air
He looks out for blood, so beware

Run, run for your life
Flee from the black pits of hell
Fight, fires alight
Warlocks are casting deadly spells
Strange is the land where spirits dwell

Race against the sands of time
He's got you in his coil
The leatherwings and talon's rage
Unfolding to destroy
No mercy for the victim
Who treads upon the blade
And falls apart

Sorcerors and witches
fear the cracking of your whip
Revenants and skeletons
You'll show them all your tricks
Your weapons are a legend
The chain of holy steel
And sacred shield

Hear the voice from the past
You will find out at last
There's a quest that is waiting for you and your soul

A swirl of the chain, the darkness, the rain
The fury, the pain and your power that soars

Vampire Killer

The scream of a virgin
that bleeds in the dark
Resounds
In the dungeons cold

The laugh of a demon
That glides in the air
His life is your blood, so beware

Force, moonlight's the source
Fueling the strenght of your foes
Strike, strongest in might
Free now the village from this curse
Hunting the undead overlord

Centuries have passed by
and still the evil reigns
Stealing blood from cursed nights
We all know who's to blame
The hunger of the vampire
The mesmerizing eyes
And killing bite

Sneaking as a night-thief
through the ancient corridors
Your flying whip, a charming snake
It's ready for some more
The vengeance of the hunter
A fighter who was trained
To lift the curse

Hear the voice from the past
You will find out at last
There's a quest that is waiting for you and your soul

A swirl of the chain, the darkness, the rain
The fury, the pain and your power that soars

Vampire Killer(Instrumental)I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep 
As friend gather round and mourners they weep 
My mind thinks of all the things I have done 
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on 
And on................and on 

As they lower me down into that hole in the ground 
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound 
I fear at the lid, my fingers they bleed 
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream 
Summon the dead.......... 
Baphomets call........... 
Blood on my hands........ 

"Let me out of here" 

My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot 
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box 
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight 
I promise the rise of my body this night 
Summon the dead.......... 
Baphomets call........... 
Blood on my hands........ 
Screaming in torment..... 
I'm felling you all...... 
Take heed of my plea..... 
Answer my call........... 
I'm gonna be free........once upon a groomy long time
a man was drawn by the valuable sky
real token of the moonlight in the night
to explore a remote horizon.
time was then to ride
ride away from his side
through the forest of damnation
and face the fear of the unknown
before the night.

he wanders alone
into the haze of the hard winter
the shooting stars he will go by
he gazes at the sky
while lying in the night
into his deepest dreams
he will find the place.

as a nebula brights in the endlessness
a rider reflects the beauty
of the darkness
as a sheep comes upon a starving wold
a wanderer meets greedy and
grasping scouts.

like in every battle some bodies will
lose their lives
those who survive will feast the victory
cause every warrior get thirsty
in view of mead
and celebrate until the morning gleam.

where the night is blooming they
will drink and sing
and pour out many horns until
the stars are gone.Nocturnal Skies rising above the Nordic Land
Darkness, dusk is rising
Darkness grows, covering the world such a shroud
The frozen light of the sun is dying, in moonshades
Goddess of night throne, blinding queen
Eternal moon reign, on a kingdom of dark shapes
The coldest moon is shining on the frozen land
Forsaken in ancient fears in a dark gleam of eclipse
Our mother Earth is diving into obscurity
Nightshades, the dawn will never rise
Nightshades fall upon a sullen and darkened earth
The sun has failed in storming thunder, in a dying shade
Nocturnal creatures from a distant past
Invisible torments, grinding in the lunar clearness
The claws of night prevail in a last embrace
I, Gaia, condemn humanity to endless night
In fear of my night children, the hunters will become the preys
For having betrayed my creation and soiled the sovereign nature
I, mother Earth, knew atrocious sufferings
And now the time to revenge has come
Under the funeral skies, forever(Instrumental)The melancholy comes with me
My heart just keeps on crying
Crying tears of blood in my heart

I remember everything
Her eyes, her mouth, her scent,
A silence on the air
I remember melancholy
Her trembling body and her empty hands

The clock continues it's cours

I never knew why god
Why you take her away

Every day is endless
My tears are sorrow
I won't be without you
Tears of blood in my heart

I'm alone in my room
Listening to this song
Trying to forget you

I remember everything
I remember that day

You told me a pact of blood with close our love

My only one love, I want to see you again
To be together and never fall apartJOURNEY TO ETERNITY

TODAY MY HOUR HAS ARRIVED.
MANY OF US WERE WHO FALL IN THIS LENGTHY WAR.
I HONOURED TO MY DECEASED, 
I GAVE THANKS TO THE ELEMENTS 
AND FOUGHT BY MY GODS.

I SAW TO FALL FRIENDS 
AND I SPLITTED THE ABDOMEN OF MY ENEMIES.
I SHOWED RESPECT FOR THE STAGES AND RITES 
WHICH WERE SHOWED ME, 
AND A GREAT TREE WAS BORNING 
AT THE LONG OF TIME.
I OPENED THE CIRCLE TIME AND TIME AGAIN 
AND IT WILL FOLLOW OPENED IN THE ETERNITY THIS WAYDark winds
Black wings
Icewinds
Embraced by the blood
Of ravenhearts

Over mountains
Over fields
Brought by black wings
Brought by winds 

Through the icewinds
Over seas
Over mountains
Over fields

Follow the dark sign
Follow the north sign
Follow the wolf sign
Follow the ravenheart

Follow the dark winds
Follow the black wings
Follow the bloodline
Follow the ravenheartUnder burned soil, past buried deep
Among the roots and stones quiet sleep

A trail of an ancient song
Perfection in rune and rhyme
Shadows tall, fought and won
The poems echo on ruined walls

Now, sent to their journey last with all sorrow and trust
Travel to the great halls, burn towards the dusk

Glows of fires from distant lands
The light of stars on dead-calm strands
This land should flourish and cradle new spring
But only grief and plague it holds within

For nothing that's buried can lay still
Shadows grow longer and harder to kill
As cycles of tides are bound to turn
So is the soil destined to burnScreech the ghouls of deepest wynter
The wolves howl as I prowl the perimetre
Cursed with negative maegen wounds
We search our servile souls.

Tears rain like blood from Thunor's sky
(leave) grief bleached bones behind.

Smash through wooden shield like snow
Our swords will cut with Woden's words
Weep and ask your god for help
Upon your virgin lips.

Tears rain like blood from Thunor's sky
(leave) grief bleached bones behind.

Woden. Thunor. Tiu. Freo

Hail them.... Wassail!!!

We're here, your there
In here, in there
Come here, we're there
In here, we're there.

(Heed the) screech of deepest wynterevil starts form within the womb his words spread the virus
harvesting under the royal cloak he has no name, for he is many
covered in their empty shells
he feeds on hopes, dreams and illusions
death amongst the dead
in flames to resurrect, the demigod

the tragedy of mankind haunts us by our innermost fears

nihilist son of a bitch until the demons come
and certain order forms in the chaos
honing a false portrait of pureness
the good is being murdered in their suffering existence

drowning in their own treachery
swallowed by the cold hard ground
a place of longing in an endless stream

he feeds on hopes dreams and illusions
death amongst the dead in flames to ressurect
a revelation of carnage until the demons come
and certain order forms in the chaos
honing the false portrait of pureness

o ibis the omnipotent is our malice satisfying

a revelation of carnage
disciple, a strict place of longing(Instrumental)I feel through the ancient sunsets
I breathe in the wind and the trees
I once had the girl and the hillsides
And a fighting family
I loved my family
And my sword

I think of whoring 'til sunrise
I think of the day I will die
I know my path is destined
I trudge it with a smile
I laugh with the beautiful children
I cry with the wrinkled hag
I cry

Heathen yes I am
Heathen yes I will
Accept what we are
Heathen through our death

I don't need your salvation
Your god is not for me
I once had the girl and the hillsides
And my family
Take it as read
Despite what you said
I have no need for change
I cry

This is my way
There's no contest
I hail all the gods of the wind and the rain
Of pleasure and pain and more
I climb to the top of the hillside
My beautiful girl at my side
I swing my sword at the sky
And we cry(Instrumental)(Instrumental)wie ein dunkler schatten
auf des geistes haupt
entreisst uns jene kraft
an was wir einst geglaubt

ein tiefgrauer schleier
ruht auf meinem sinn
und die erinnerung
schwindet dahin

gegen die kraft des vergessens
auch wenn mein blut zu boden rinnt
erhebe ich mein schwert 
vergesse nie wo meine wurzeln sind

gegen die kraft des vergessens
erhebe ich mein schwertThere must be more to this
This place is for the weak
Somewhere down below
Is the land that I seek
The fires are always hot
The women are so cold
Doesn't matter if you're
Guilty or not and you'll never get old
All hail Hell your soul will sell
The flesh is burning now
The blood starts to boil
Don't want no God or Devil
To no one I am loyal
The pain is what I need
It feels oh so nice
I'd rather fry down here
Than freeze in Heaven's ice
Your life is meaningless
Why can't you see
Kill now while you can
Just not me
Do what and all you want
The time is yours
I'll meet you down here
I'll greet you at Hell's doorsBetween mountains
My spirit flies free
And sings the sound
Of my forefathers

In the battle filed heard
Thousand voices from
My forefathers

Whose guides me through
One more victory in the battle
From my forefathersI elevate myself above your god,
Because I vote from the roof tops,
I consider myself a saviour of the day.
One shot in the head, none more, none less,
I pray,
I vote from the rooftops,
One verse for every man emerging in the crosshair's eyes...

A precise device will at last prove me superior,
I vote from the rooftops,
So I vote my way down the brimstone gates.
By homicide,
I'm tryin' to make a point,
Point blank, I vote from the rooftops,
I fuck with life no one has dared before.

In a way I am a hunter,
I the the woods to regulate,
For what lies ahead
Is worse than leaden hate.
A space above capacity,
Atrocities of reproduction, 
Cannon fodder keeps on marching
Forward towards selfdestruction.

I hail the drug-fueled titans marching on...
And those I had missed keep marching on...

I raise my gun,
I raise my beer, 
I celebrate my being
as the last man standing...On the edge of bloody war, you'd better choose your side, 
The race is on now don't you fall, never look behind, 
The time has come to free your soul, to not let fate decide, 
Turn around and greet your inner mind. 


The call of fate is screaming over hills and through the skies, 
(Fate is warning)
And maybe it is time for us to heed the call to fight,
(War is calling) 
Gather all your strength, your soul and journey on your way,
(Men are falling) 
Our victory is waiting at the end of this bloody day
(Death is coming) 

...In this War of Destiny


Our lives can shine so bright in this world, wont you follow me, 
And soon we'll be on the brink of a great victory

[Guitar Solos]

When the fight is over will we be here standing tall, 
Or will we both have passed into the land of never more, 
A wise soul, he once said to me, hold on to the end, 
And watch the magic vanquish all despair.

...In this War of DestinyI'll never pledge allegiance to the flag for which it stands, a nation under god, don't make me laugh. cultural destruction embraces this falling land,you watch your people die, I don't understand..... I DON'T UNDERSTAND!! 

Fifty stars and thirteen stripes, the American symbol you follow blind. To my cause I am true, not the fading colors red, white, and blue. Fifty stars and thirteen stripes, The American symbol raped your mind. A new world order has just begun, and towards the horizon we'll reach the sun. 

A diseased country that once was pure, now urban decay in need of a cure. an epidemic of criminals and parasites, depopulated by methods of genocide. I see right through the multicultural lie, and mourn a nation that slowly dies. A stagnat cesspool in disarray, self destruction, the American way... The American Way! 

Fifty stars and thirteen stripes, the American symbol you follow blind. To my cause I am true, not the fading colors red, white, and blue. Fifty stars and thirteen stripes, The American symbol raped your mind. A new world order has just begun, and towards the horizon we'll reach the sun. 

I'll never pledge allegiance to your fucking mockery, do you think i'd follow in the steps of treachery. To be betrayed, decived by the government, and a failing system that is so decadent. I'll fight to restore the strength of my creed, and to embrace the hope for someone to lead. Awake the masses and it won't be long, until you hear the voice of a million strong!The mankind is dump, devouring all junk
The priests are serving for truth
Charity's their hobby and heaven's their hope
But their faith is based on idiocy

Satan is present, he's ruling the world
Are you too blind to see it?
World War III will prove my advice
Good is a stupid Device

DESTROY

Fools look around you, the whole world's malicious
Bloodshed and war, the mankind is vicious

Black mights will rise, nobody retains them
No god, no priest and no pope
Demoniac forces will be allied
To clean this world of false doctorines 

Fools look around you, the whole world's malicious
Bloodshed and war, the mankind is vicious

Heaven or hell? the answer is clear
So better serve Satan, your lord
Don't be so stupid, to renounce his being
Or his might will destroy youNations of blockheads
Rotten civilizations:
Cutting trees and burning forests
Building bigger towns and dams
Burning more petroleum
Building modern industries
Give them what they've created
Give them now their own future
Offer them to stop loosing their time
Show them what hate and vengeance means
Burn
Kill
Clean this world under money domination
Burn
Kill
Clean this world and its decadent parasites(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Never end... 
The pain is the love 
the life is like the death 
yeahhhhhhh 
Burning... 
My soul never in peace 
Bleeding... 
The tears are red 
And black is the way 
We will never return 

Never end... 
The suffering is eternal 
Ever in pain 
The insane is real 

Never end... 
Torments arround 
Voices screaming 
Ghosts calling to the dance 
A valse to the dead 
Carnal memories 
the eternal suffer 
the abyss... 
A dark mind 
Never end...Across the seas of nevermore
There lies the ancient bloody shore
Where living dead still walk the land
Demon warriors of the damned

The fires burn blood red
Upon the Isle of the Dead

The mariners still tell the tale
Of the island gate to Hell
Where sinners of the seven seas
Live out the curse of blasphemy

The fires burn blood red
Upon the Isle of the Dead

Black gate to Nifleheim
The Bells of Hell still chime
Judgement beyond the grave
Condemns their souls to burn in flames

The fires burn blood red 
Upon the Isle of the DeadSwirling desert sands surround my disembodied ka
As I gaze unblinking into the unblinking eye of Ra
I witness visions of distant vistas eclipsed
By the far-flung, ominous shadows of monolithic monuments

Cyclopean, stone idols placed on rock-hewn plinths
Looming over every obliterated edifice
Like jagged crags protruding from a watery abyss
Towering, tottering obelisks engraved with ancient hieroglyphs

Reach toward the sky like the colossal, clutching claws
Of Cthulhu crushing constellations in triumphant paws
Ascending and rending the trembling heavens with might
Impaling frail seraphim on gore-adorned pikes

Traveling across eternal oceans of sand
I ride with the ghouls on the howling night-wind
To the accursed, nameless city that no living man has seen
Save for myself, in the delirium of dreams

The crumbling, nameless city whispered of in dread and fear
Wherein reside secrets no man else has ever dared to hear
Sinister secrets hissed by strange-tongued fiends
And tempestuous, swirling winds enwreathing my tormented dreams

Amid the pathless deserts of Arabia
Where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched

Descending countless steps into Stygian depths below
Beneath the ruins of the city abandoned aeons ago
In this unlighted chamber of unveiled mysteries
Through dusky haze, I gaze upon displays that beckon me

Upon the walls of sunless halls, exotic murals spread
Like multi-colored tapestries illumined by some glow ahead
Their images evoking vivid visions of the past
Depictions of an ancient empire, vast and unsurpassed

The mummified remains of some long-forgotten, elder race
Aligned in rows and donning robes, remain bejeweled and encased

Never shall I forget those strange and ancient things entombed
The realm of radiance that emanates beyond a gate of doom
And the hellish night-wind that commands the sands of barren lands
Howling like the Jinn, it resounds throughout the vast expanse

Al Azif!Behold my offering come forth to me! With the melting of wax and the burning of sage. Release me from this life, the torment, the pain. 
Engulfing desires ending my misery ,salvation is coming from the palace within. These voices they whisper, they speak of enlightenment they speak of immortality.

Behold your rulers in power, infecting the masses with their invention, laughing at the hearts of all, conjuring invoking, evoking.

Cure my torture and my torment make me feeling nothing. For I desire the emptiness and the void, the darkness and the solitude. Keeper of the winds, the black flame. Show me wonders show me sustain. These burnt offerings I give to you. Take the voices take the pain. 

Behold your rulers in power, infecting the masses with their invention, laughing at the hearts of all, conjuring invoking, evoking.Four black wings beat in the morning sky.
The winds come from the north to ice us
with a frozen embrace.
They behold the world, in an eternal solitude.
For centuries in a yet forgotten sadness.
But the day of war is near.
Rome shall burn to ashes.
Ravens will command,
the hordes of the underworld.
Where is your immoral civilization?
Where are your values?
They rot in the landscapes of our ground.
Where our fathers rot to the sun,
eaten by the vultures of Sucellus.
By my honour... the black is the only colour
in this heart.
Hear me Allfather.
Why are we condemned?The sky is clear and the moon shines bright
The stars burn through the trees
The night is black and the snow is white
All things seem to be unseen

The glowing eyes of animals around staring at me
The cold wind blows into my face
Like fire does it seem

Full moon shines searing down
The day shall never come
My tears are running from my eyes
My blood spills from my arms

I am immortal I can't die but I will feel deep pain
My eyes are red, my hair is black all my kingdom is

Eternal is dark forest
Eternal is the night
Deep dark forest eternally

The sun rise up I clear believed
The forest sight in me
But winter is. The days are short
And dark are all the trees

The sun goes down, the twilight comes followed by the night
Silent stands the deep dark forest and the moon shines bright

Eternal is dark forest
Eternal is the night
Deep dark forest eternally(Instrumental)Seven witches in ther dance
Changing names twisting their hands
Fires are burning reaching sky
Calling out name of their light

The bell is ringing the time is round
Words are spoken they're falling
onto the ground
fires still burning flames burn bright
The shadows come before their light

In your beginning we were
In your quest - we are
Before you - We existed
After you - We shall still be

Dance I command you !!!

Dance is over fires are gone
One of them is still on the ground
Her naked body trembling fast
As she is gone for her last danceRiding to the end of flesh magic final, 
magic death... 
Open my eyes to life and death, 
back ws the path of the lights. 
Sweet tears in earth of wisdom. 

I will be teached in the great battle and 
equilibrium of the woods. I will ride 
the horse of fire. I will dropped 
in the deep dirt ARISE! 
In the water I will see the reflect 
of life embracing death. Crying the skies, 
the earth speak, the seas dance. 
I know that my disappearance 
will never arrive. 
The awaking of conscience will be 
revelated to me. No one will survive 
from the great battle. 
I listen to my learned body 
riding to my magic death with no fear. 
Dancing with my free spirit, 
even find (the path of the light).Heathen possessed cursed from birth
Mark of the beast engraved cross will turn
No laws of light shall be obeyed
Demonic pits were summoned priests were chained
Evil x3 like a knife
Baptized in vomit straight from the ram
Drink all the blood that's given from your hand
Lessons of holy fully denied
A lethal dose of blasphemy were mine
Evil x3 like a knife
Your sole creation of wickedness
Born to burn and defile your holiness
The gates of hell are open wide
Bursting out with vengeance souls collideLook at a new dawn
The rime hurts our faces
Today, our paths lead us in different places 
The way of sorrow, we've crossed for a while,
Will prosecute only deep inside my mind
I relive
What I once lived forever

At the end of the night, the sun shines again
And the shadows hide themselves
Keep the memory in your heart as a fairytale
Remember your name and honour it
Until we meet again
In this land

Over the hills
At the end of the storm
Hear and preserve all these magical words
It's time to believe
It's time to forget
Fulfil your destiny, you must have no regrets

Even though you'll climb
The highest mountain
Do not look behind
Show no fear
Carry on with pride
Let this learning be carved inside your heart
All the things you'll find
Keep 'em inside you
As a silver line which you must follow
Live everyday
As if it was the last one

Over the hills
At the end of the storm
Hear and preserve all these magical words
It's time to believe
It's time to forget
Fulfil your destiny, you must have no regrets(Instrumental)(Instrumental)As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the universe and everything inside
I detest all I see, nothing pleases my mind

Execute them all
It's my final war

I hate the sight of you, fashion fake
Joke
I detest every man who cannot stand
Alone

Execute them all
It's my final war

As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the tales you tell, I don't
Believe a word
I detest the stuf you sell, I'll hunt
You around the world

Execute them all
It's my final war

When my days are numbered you'll hear
My final call
I'll take their lives away, I'll execute
Them all

Execute them all
It's my final war

Execute them all
It's my final war(Instrumental)In the land of castles,
A majestic duskfall rises,
Changes place,
With the warm and cloudless day.

Across harmonic waves in green,
The clarions call,
As they did in ancien times.

Burned in my heart,
Enforcing memories to last.

Forest as far as the eye can reach,
Below continous green peaks,
Through storm and plague, forevermore,
Engraved in the endless path of nature.

Exposition, of stone walls in the wind,
Remembrance, to the wild ages of their birth.

Treasures, more precious than gold,
Left for the few who reach out further,
Left for eye and memory.

The mountainside at far horizons,
Protective wall of might, of glory,
Stand up strong, hold up tight,
For the land of castles.

"Stay by my side forever",
She said, with a last spark in her dying eyes,
So I entered the land of castles,
To bury my heart.

Memories in the land of nature....
As she departed with the wind,
I remember....treasurelandTears for the sunrise, witness of the dawn,
awakens the sleeper from his rest, still and warm.
Alone he greets the morning, blinks the light from his eyes,
turns his face from the vision, to the gods he cries,
"Why have you forsaken me enslaved to the unknown?
These years of savage plague have left me scarred like ancient stone". 

Nerthus, Nerthus I cry for thee, mine eyes burn, sorrows grieve.
The holy fires of Hel have never crimsoned such as these.
Gods of death fathered the children, see them rise.
Midst the paling corn, the priest dances deiseil no more.
The scythe is raised, it can only fall.

Witness of the morning wipe thy moisty eyes.
Tis time no more for grieving, time for gods to rise.
The corn grows pale and yellow, scythe is honed and sharp,
Hunting-moon will waxen as the days grow dark.
Now the quick must fall as leaves drop silently from trees,
and, cold and still, push up their mounds into the Autumn breeze.

Mankind, mankind I cry for thee, mine eyes burn, sorrows grieve.
The holy fires of Hel have never crimsoned such as these.
Gods of death fathered the children, see them rise.
Midst the paling corn, the priest dances deiseil no more.
The scythe is raised, it can only fall.

With plaited limbs of golden stalks, the ben holds the spirit of the corn.
Awaits the Spring, her naked body stripped of emerald, buried, shall be reborn.

With golden spears and plumed heads, the master race believed invincible,
but gold must bend before the scythe or else to break, to fall so cold and still.

And the Earth shall be holy once more.

Waiting the season in endless time, I've seen the sunrise and She was mine.
No more confusion, darkness brings light; gods are awakened, now they will fight.
Mankind warned so many times by vision, word and deed.
As corn you grew so tall and strong, but now you've gone to seed.

Abred, Abred I cry for thee, mine eyes burn, sorrows grieve.
The holy fires of Hel have never crimsoned such as these.
Gods of death fathered the children, see them rise.
Midst the paling corn, the priest dances deiseil no more.
The scythe is raised, it can only fall.The Path is dominated by the Dreamturmoil
Burning in fire of appearing Visions
The might of the Will calling gods
From Heaven...
In a forest of Lances get lost the Light
The Beauty embrace the dead's rotting corpse
Hiding to veil of Mist the mysterious
Cavern of Destiny
Raises doubt in Soul

But I know
There wait for me my faithful Companion
Embarrass the burden of strange meeting
Then also overpowering

Although the fire's smoke Phoneix is suffocating
And tower before me the Dreadful Dragon
In blinding armour
The Lunatic Herald on Triumphal Gig gallop across
His empire, strew about ash from his hand...

On Wheel-Broken-Slaves damned scream
Travel all over the Valley of Sight

Escort the Tempter and laugh Derisively
Windows of my Church are smashed in
The Sword of Damokles break into in the Dust
What engaging on it's chipped blade the splendour
Of my Star...

No mecy in the eyes of the Spider
But I tore her web just now!
And I beheaded Cerberus long ago...
I drunk the health of Spheres with Erebus
I fought the army of Gigants on Gaia's land

I had a bath in blood-red Avernus
Enchanted by song of Sirens
I became incarnate in the Sigh
Bursting with life in the Word

Depth and Height
Merging in the Circle
My face pledge of his Face
In the Mirror reflective Mirror...(Instrumental)Snow gently covers the land Wind blowing in your face You have come so far To take revenge It is night time Pure blackness over the land As you search for somewhere to sleep Before you freeze At dawn you will venture out into the new land to take revenge You enter a dark forest And draw out an arrow You hunt your prey so you can survive into the next day The next morning blood shall be shedThe avenger in his name,
For his country! Aedui!
Druid of the men of fire, he was a king.
Seeking peace but finding war,
And his brother's death.
Without honor he became a traitor to his blood.

Torn...
...Between his blood and his role as king.
No doubt in his wolf's eyes!
Kill to save is necessary but unforgivable.

Diviciacos!

Having sold his brother,
For his country! Aedui!
To protect and defend his celtic kingdom,
As a beast he finds war,
And his brother's death.
Without honor he became a traitor to his blood.

Torn...
...Between his blood and his role as king.
No doubt in his wolf's eyes!
Kill to save is necessary but unforgivable.

Diviciacos!(Instrumental)I'm walking through a snow-white landscape
Lightened by the stars upon the sky
I'm thinking about the past and the future
While forgetting the present

Too many questions
Can't get them out of my mind
Too many thoughts
can't stop thinking

Walking... Walking...
What's right or wrong?

Walking... Walking...
Still time to change things?

Walking... Walking...
Coldness is entering my veins

I can't move anymore
Winter brings me a consoling sleep

Dreams are dead now

I want to get out of that Hypothermialoneliness surrounds me and my thougths
I submit to destiny
in my empty eyes
my lost dreams are mirrored back

my thoughts lead me on never entered paths
but where do the ways end?
I just see bleak blackness
but I can never turn back again

my feets want me no longer to take
life makes me tired
I only want to sleep-finally sleep
and forget my lost dreams

I dream the dream of eternity
I would it with pleasure become real
and I will be no longer taken in
by the illusion of life

life seems forgotten
the day, the night,
the senseless memories
mirrors themselve back in my lost dreams

a life in a world without light
controlled by the bleakness of my thoughts
which drives me slowly into abyss
untill the eternal blackness surrounds me

the shackles, which chain me to life
become weaker and weaker
done with life, I'm ready to face the death
to forget my lost dreams forever(Instrumental)Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lived there
She once was a true love of mineTag 92:
Bin  wirklich ich das gewesen?Threatening bloodred sky
As if falling down
Grounds is shaking under my feet
Seems like the last breath is near

Pure chaos everywhere
I see the nation in dread
Dying and crying
Running for their lives

Chorus:
Awakening of primeval force
Return of the mighty one

Purgatory night
The sign of new era
The weak ones will die
Those who betrayed once...

From the darkest of forests
Through the fog of ages
Primeval force rising
The rest is over, time to return

Chorus...

Now bastard
You can feel the hate of nature
I am the chosen one
To take your worthless lifeYou burn us to ashes 
Within politics of consumption 
Ultimate increase of population 
Ultimate decrease of existence 

Doomed on planet earth 
We are lost within 
Our egomaniac beliefs in our sanity 
All what will remain are our ashes 
The ashes of remembrance 

Ashes of remembrance 
Who will remember 
We are the cancer of ourselves 
Ashes of remembrance 
Who will remember 
The parasite that killed the host 

Our minds blinded by profit maximation 
Hunger for power - the only fuel 
Feed the cancer with the hate that we shareThe sun has risen to coronate the new day 
She wears its crown like fire on her hair 
With moon silver upon her timeless face 
Without sorrow she cries her fertile tears 

The life she's granted is not here to last 
The day will come when she'll claim it back 
With sun descending into the ocean waves 
Without fear I absorb the coming end 

And days fall like dead leaves 
From the tree of life until it's bare 
When ravens begins to circle 
And her voice is calling you 
You know it's good day to die 

Suncrown - coronation of her fertile force 
Suncrown - unending cycle of birth and death 

And days fall like dead leaves 
From the tree of life until it's bare 
When life has become a heavy burden 
And has nothing left to offer it's good day to die(Instrumental)Vala - Tell me what you see
Woman - Tell me how things will be

Odin rode to the seer seeking wisdom
Of the fate of the gods of the north
This is what Vala said unto Odin
Your doom is cold as stone

Odin - You want the truth be told
Father - The world will return to cold
Hear me - Your doom is cold as stone
Odin - Your doom is cold as stone

What you seek, I have seen, The bane of Balder
How he dies, the bleeding god, son of Odin
And the fall of the moon, and the sun above

Human destructor...

Lyrics by IpseMy dream - end of Muslim world 
Your religion, your life
Die for Allah's it's your aim
Suicide will give you glory
You'n come to heaven and destroy your enemies
about whom you know nothing 
Over Rotten civilisation west 
What is more, the civiisation bring you knowledge 
how to share terror
how to use knowledge from other side 
only for destruction 
It's all you have known
In your absurd you are worst than christians 
I hate you all
Suppose I will di e tomorrow 
But you are dead even nowTwilight burn across the sky
Time has come the doom is near
Stillness rules this cloudless night
Armageddon is here

Woe to you
Earth and Sea
TOTAL DESTRUCTION

12 days of total eclipse
Yet the stillness rules this night of mist
But slowly clouds of death are forming
The time has come to Reap

Burning skies
Battle cries
TOTAL DESTRUCTION

The end of mankind universe
So many battles yet to fight
Take heed forever learn
When the bells chime THE RETURN...

Screams of fear
The doom is here
TOTAL DESTRUCTION(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Autumn is embracing the land
All voices are disappearing
The landscape is fading to grey
And the nature is going to sleep

The fog is covering the fields
Just fragments of trees I can see
Withering leaves under my feet
Every step will bring me back in time

Refrain:
"My mind is flying in the shpere of time 
I see myself walking on the old path
The elder path of my forefathers
Consecration will come"

This is a lonely walk through the mist
Wisdom and faith in the eyes of a raven
I see it's mighty wings in the sky
Full of proud and full of spirit

Winter is embracing the land
All the light are disappearing
The landscape is fading to white
And the nature is sleeping these days

Is this the end of all life?
All these moments frozen in ice
This is just the beginning!
The wheel of time is turning further

Refrain

I lay a thought on it's wings - to carry it away
Oh, bring it to the sun - so far behind the clouds
The misery of this time - all sorrow will go by
I'm looking forward to the future - so fly raven, flyEinstein Intersections and Babel 17
Tweaked sex roles, language, and all in-between
Subversive insertion of your progressive mores
Into standard Sword and Sorcery
Passion plays
Forget the old white writer smoking a pipe
Try a bisexual black man with a lust for life
No more fiction that's his decision
Making a religion of incisive criticism!
Stars In My Pocket Like Grains of Sand!
The Motion of Light in Water!
We In Some Strange Power's Employ!
Move On a Rigorous Line!(Instrumental)The God abouve you think is held high
Time to give up now it's all just a lie - just a lie
No one to help in your time of need
I'll rip your throat and watch you bleed - watch you bleed
We'll take your Lord in chains
The Violators are coming on strong
They do no right all we do is wrong - so wrong
We show no mercy to any of your kind
Mutilate them all you're so blind - so blind
We'll take your Lord in Chains
Your Lord is weak now soon he's dead
Now's the chance take this path I have led
The armies of the dead march through mud
Conquering the throne now stained in blood
The life you knew is all in the past
The only way now it to live it fast - live it fast
Sin at will kill with desire
We'll fan the flames still growing higher - growing higher
Not to serve in Heaven!(Instrumental)Smoke is drifting in the breeze
Among the barren black trees
Here and there a hand or a face
A sword, a spear, sticking out
The ground is steaming still
Of all the blood it drank
A lonely horse is standing
Faithfully next to its master

Testimony to the cruely of the cross
Such is the way of their loving god
Submit or die, broken either way
No peace with their religion
With the last of his strength
A dying wish drawn in the soil
For someone to avenge this
Blood must be paid in blood

Smoke is clearing in the woods
Only black barren trees stand
Everywhere are corpses laid
Scattered and slaughtered
Feelings of hatred and anger
Burn stronger than compassion
We claim our freedom
With the natural instinct(Instrumental)eldgamle oyne kuasse som sverd

which you leave behind your future
this impure cold blood which soaks your rusty armors
these heavy and painful wounds
you're wearing were expected
now you are deeply engraved in the memory of the sky.

the sacred stars led us for the triumph
the piece is now going to reign on the ground,
in this new day the glory gets up such a sun
ravens fly for the blood which flowed this night.

now brave young warrior turn away from the battlefield
breathe and come proudly back home
sword in your bloody hand
walk through fields and forests tell your terrible fight
and the relish with dignity,
this is the flavor of victory.

forget the deep pain which lives in you
you fought for your life and for the glory,
the fallen ones rest in another world
but now enjoy the flavor of victory.Frost in the air, the season has come. Clouds fill the sky, gone is the sun. Our ships are harbored, a fell wind blows. We shelter our families from oncoming snows.

A year has past, look at the skies, still shades of grey. No light will shine on our fields, bodies waste away. Noble lords horde their stores, thralls will rebel. Loki's daughter with joy in her heart, opens the gates of Hel.

I take, my last breat, with open arms, i welcome death. With no god, away from home, kin is gone, i die alone. Friends turn now its every man for himself, honor still held by the few. Bodies burn and funeral pyres light the sky, when will we start anew?

This fimbul winter has taken my soul, three years we have spent.
The world has been split right in whole, no help will be sent.
Long prophesied by the wisest and old, frost of the ancients.

See the smoke in the sky, three years pass and many have died.
Some still stand proud and tall, waiting for the dawn.
Horizon glows a blood red hue, and fills the air where ravens flew.
But men's hope turns to despair, as Surt's sword cuts through the air.

Heavens split, fire rains down, we understand, the end is now.
This winter brings the end of time, sons of fire from muspelheim.
Asa gods dress for war, as jotuns pound on asgards door.
The chosen slain from Valhall, ride out to meet the fall.(Instrumental)There had winds arise
They made clouds so dark
In the storm-sky
In the black mirk

Then they had strip up
Drowsy fields of grass
And prophetic stars
Fall from sky

Open to me gates
Let me know the seckrets
Or will weakly fall
Three of Universe

Waiting is my life
Under snow of ash
Like this blood red
River my flow

Veiled dream prophetic
Will occurs like shadow
In the abysstime
It will vanish from the life

I see blood
On the grass
I see blood
In the blaze

There had winds arise
They made clouds so dark
In the storm-sky
In the black mirk

Then they had strip up
Drowsy fields of grass
And prophetic stars
Fall from skyLiving Dying I just don't care
'cause me as you we'll go away
in noone nothing we trust ever
'cause we're beyond praying forever

Black Blood of misery is flowing'on
Our skin, Our fate, Our hearts of stone
The debtors of pain and life's energy
They're marching from childhood to senility

No place for love for mercy you've known
Only depression and hatred prevails
We're beyond praying it's gone by
To tell the truth life is crime

So you can't tell the heroes and culprits
I know it I won't say I can
The debtors of pain and life's energy
They're marching from childhood to senility

Don't stop me I'll die on my own
T'will be one of my turns
Don't stop me just let me go home
Were the lonely star burns

Don't bless me to be on the run
So I'll fade away
Don't bless me I'll never be back
I'll never be back again

To escape is to die
To lose all the hopes
Say you die
To the Sky to the Earth
To the Friends you leave
Say goodbye
You're condemned to be here
Anything is like there
Say you die
To the Love to the Hate
To the Dreams you leave
Say goodbyeThe songs are singing and the beer drinking
We are feasting - we are pleasing the Gods
Night is like days 'cause fires light it
Joy is at faces and let fear become ashes

Night is like day and here is our happiness
Holiday of fathers and here is our gladness
Tomorrow we will be at work again
Now we're singing the songs, praising the gods 

chorus:
Gorgeous sunshine brings us joy
Bright sickle Moon is now with us
Holiday of fathers is now with us
Holiday of fathers is the holiday of ours
We gathered here together
To recollect our fathers

The time of battles for now passed
Let's chase away time of grief
Our children are here with us
Our ancestors are here with us

chorus:
Gorgeous sunshine brings us joy
Bright sickle Moon is now with us
Holiday of fathers is now with us
Holiday of fathers is the holiday of oursSeason of night it will betray me
Your guiding light will drown to bottom
Don't ask me how the river tells me
I just see that crosses standing bright
The one who will is you my brother
Go into night it's your turning
Betrayed race for foreign altars
The broken roots inside your heart
But battle awaits me
Awaits those who fell beside
The river that season
When lightnings of Perun drowned

Season of night in Pomerania
The Folks demise we cannot stop now
The winters hard and rivers frozen
Nation weeps our Perun is flowing away
Season of night it will betray me
Your guiding light will drown to bottom
Don't ask me how the river tells me
I just see that crosses standing bright


But battle awaits me
Awaits those who fell beside
The river that season
When lightnings of Perun drowned

But battle awaits me 

It tells me the sun will die

But battle it blinds me 

For mercy and for the light


A horseman with the sun in hands
The night upon the darken lands
Landscape by the dusk embraced
Don't believe in what you see
Let me take you where we are
Just a willow in the far
Let me show you all that is
Just a cold of winters mist and night
I am the battle of the evermight
I am the plague whenever there's a war
I curse the bloood of the weakest born
I am the moon and the forest below
I am the race that's reforming now
The sign of day in malestroms of night
I was the river that embraced the God
In Pomerania...Let me tell you this tale of lords
Who came from remote lands
To steal the sacred lance
To the ones born by frost.

They were waiting for the nightfall
When wolves slept, the stick of sway
Was snatched from its room
But the winter saw what they had done.
And the wind blew towars the shining wisdom well
Where the supreme fighter was keeping watch...
So they were destined to die at dawn
When the early rising horse touched the sky
And it lighted up their haunt.

Then he went hunting for the midnight thieves,
Guided by his ravens, throughout the nine worlds,
Attracted by the smell of fear just like worms.

And a dull caw was the encounter sign
Between the hunter and his prey.
The morning clouds began to cry,
And his anger became unstoppable,
The fighter rushed the intruders group,
And a lightning crossed the tears.
Thousands of bits of flesh and blood
Remained on the battlefield.

And the storm let the calm by...
And he took again what him was (made)

And each bit of their entrails
Were spread along the southern lands.
Being condemned to be conquered
And annihilated.
By the great fighter sons
Who should show for ever more
The price of playing with their gods.(Instrumental)Invocad claves dementes

Now, lands are screaming to be saved.
The son of Earth shouldn't make
The same mistake.
Pain is bitting from the inside,
Someday,not to far,
Will unchain all the power Of life.
Nature makes you real.
The fragility of life.
Don't devast miles and miles...
Wisdoms of life.
Mother Nature..
....tears of life.
Lay on
The fragility of life.

INVOCAD!!! INVOCAD!!! INVOCAD!!!Gil Galad was a elf king
The last with a kingdom of beauty and free
Between the mountains and the seas
He lived for a long time
Nobody knows where he goes
The stars fall in the darkness
From Mordor where the shadows live(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Army must go...

Jew ignited the middle east bomb
We must force our men onto the front
No castles to burn, no towns to flatten
One on one with machine gun in hand

Army must go ...
Take the mountains
Take the frost and sandstorms

Another plague to be extinct
Oh! We have waited for so long
To nourish the desert soil with corpses stench
As wanted as the holy land

Army must go...
To take hold... hold
Take the palace of their god

No forests for hostages to impale on
No crops to curse with famine
To hold horde steel fist terror
Make them nod their heads to fall

Army must go...
Take the nomad souls
And leave the skeletonsThere's an old man, here in town
Maybe you have seen him
But don't you try, even too loud
He'll not answer the yelling

He shows up he's bored with a huge snore
He's paying no attention!
Who could be this old man
that has just fallen asleep?

Grandma says that he was brave
strong, kind and sexy.
Won a fight with only bare hands,
enemies were at least sixty!

Calm the storm, tame the seas,
take the dog for a walk.
He could do anything.
Anything he wanted

Uncork a bottle in his name, hooray! Hooray!
Uncork a bottle in his name, hooray! Hooray!
Uncork a bottle in his name, rum, whiskey, it's all the same!
'Cause tonight we're drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking again!

Remember what we're drinking for, hooray! Hooray!
Remember what we're drinking for, hooray! Hooray!
Remember what we're drinking for, so drink and drink and drink some more!
Til we lie on the ground, drunken and proud of what we have become.

He discovered Vinland,
well, he and some of his friends.
A place with great resources:
Hops, malt and also wine grapes.

They brewed a lot, A LOT of drinks
-Alcoholic type-
And when they finished drank them
To see what tasted like.

So next day when he got up
He had hangover so great
that burped as loud and fiercely
That became completely deaf

Now that you know the story
and why he cannot hear,
You must hail Erik the Deaf
The viking with no ears!Big gardens of pleasure,
Never know death,
Huge streams of goodness,
One in its own type

Lost paradise - did it exist?
Lost paradise - only fiction?

Lost paradise do you really believe in it?
Lost paradise but where did evil come from?Myths of the past ages
Keys to our inner selves
Seeking guidance and powers of reasoning
The names of my gods invoke wisdom and strength
I feel the warmth of the swastika
Rising from the cold earth
I trust in the answers received
For it is the voice of my blood that answers

But many follow religions and beliefs
Not born of the blood
Destroying the threads
Which bind man with nature
Kinsman with kinsmens
To follow a mythos and belief
Not born of the blood
Is damning yourself to eternal sickness

The blood of your future
Drifts aimlessly into a blackened abyss
For glory, for Odin
The voice of my blood strives to awaken
Thousands of years of experience and knowledge
Guided by Aryans having their own folk awareness
An essential part in life
Asatru, strengthening the people
Gave purpose, meaning, unity

A collective conscious of a proud kindred
Follow the voice of your blood
To hail the gods
Is to hail yourself(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)From the dark times asunder
Mysterious symbols of might
Reveal the Elder knowledge
The secrets of Magic and Wisdom

"Victory Runes shall you know
If you want to secure wisdom
Engrave them on the ridge of the blade
On the sheath and the shield,
And Invoke Tyr Twice."
Tyr, the God of War, the Lord of life and death
The bravest warrior of the Nordic Pantheon
The strong one and ruler of the Tiwaz rune
The magic rune of courage and victory

Before a hard struggle to win
Raise proud the sword and spears
Invoking Tyr twice
The victory will be ours!

Raise proud the sword and spears
And spoken with great honor and furious power
Invoking Tyr twice
Then victory shall be ours!!(Instrumental)Filthy christian plague
False words
And false hope
I reject it all

Shameful man of god
Preaches to the sheep
I reject it all

Christ did not die for me
I reject his absurd words

I sodomize the mother of christ
I rape eve
I invert the cross
I reject all of their lies!

Not a angel left breathing
Golden gates in ruins
It is time we reject falsehoods

I command the legions
I unleash the strike against god
I reject it all

I forever hate god
I spit on the weak
I forever hate god
His words are shit
I see right though you

Satan was nothing
Compared to i...
Compared to i...O duistere nacht

Drijf mij naar haar

In verzonken

Nevelsluierige wouden

 

Naar de middernachtelijke maan

Naar de kracht van 

M'n vroeger bestaan

Naar voorouderlijke ogen

Weerspiegeld in't licht

 

Bondgenote in schemering

Verlicht mijn geest

Koud en planetair

Zoals jij vroeger deed

 

Wees in mij

Ik ben in jou

In eeuwigheidThe Winter has come 
the forst is freezing our hearts 
the snow it turns all white 
and neverending darkness reigns 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

When the winter of their return 
brings the ancient spirit back 
when their battlecry is heard 
we will rise again 

The woods have become white 
the frost has turned the seas to ice 
our mighty pagan land 
it is lying dark there under the wintermoonlight 

...under the wintermoonlight 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

By the wintermoonlight 
we rise again 

The Winter has come 
the forst is freezing our hearts 
the snow it turns all white 
and neverending darkness reigns 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

When the winter of their return 
brings the ancient spirit back 
when their battlecry is heard 
we will rise again 

...again... 
...we will rise again...When darkness falls on the city of the thieves
and starlight kisses the golden domes
He walks the streets of Arenjun
Through the shadows of the Maul
Beyond the temples of richness filled
Behind the walls, upon a hill
A silver tower arose in just one night
To guard the secret of the Jewel 
This is the story of a necromancer in days of old
Master of black arts, ruling with magic powers

He was taught the knowledge of past ages
By an ancient god he holds captive in chains
Blinded, wingless and tortured the slave is awaiting
The coming of a man, the final spell
Time has come!
The final spell of blood and stone!

Entering the garden
hair black as the night
eyes of blue steel
heathen from northern lands

A meeting with a stranger
they call the king of thieves
Beware of the prowlers
that strike in deep silence

As the city dreams they climb the walls
Reaching the tower's rim
Shining of a thousand jewels blind
the sight of the thieves so bold

Out of the chamber, Taurus falls dead
Stricken by powers unknown
Slaying the spider, Conan the brave
He makes his way through the wizard's stronghold

Inside a darkened room he lies
Descended from outer space
Body of man, the eyes of an elephant cry
The sword of the young barbarian strikes his heart
To unleash the final enchantment

Time has come!
The spell of the blood and the stone

The young man flees as the silver tower crumbles
Gone is the reign of the necromancer 
As he turns his head and gazes at the sky
Was it all real or just a strange dreamGathered together for all that is wrong
The flesh we soon shall feast
Slaughter and violence is all around
I show the mark of the beast
Corpses on corpses piled so high
The stench as it starts to burn
I am Violator none will be greater
I will return... I am Violator
The Blood's on my lips the death on my breath
I savor every bite
No one on earth can stop me now
As I perform this rite... I am Violator
The bones I will break the veins I will tear
All this makes you sick
The skin I will rip the flesh I will slice
And the blood I will lick... I am ViolatorSear unfolding flame the hearths of east 
Dawn ordained revives the trails of the ones that seek
No light serene nor sight relieved 
condone the coldest deeds
but promise of shadow that secrets keep 

Trace the silver of the moon...

Castaways, palefires light and mortal child
To realms of night, in realms we hide
Paths you tread are paths disguised
No streams follow old rivers bed
Trees bear leaves ten autumns swept 
Here in shadow that secret''s kept

Trace the silver of the moon...

Dark is the realm we sought
so dies the silver hope we wrought
dark and silent
no need to hide, no shade from light, 
what shadow will then you find inside

Trace the silver of the moon...Zeus, the Right, is on my side
His thunderbolt's burning bright
Revenge comes here
To fill you with fear
Death calls death, I take my oath:
I will see, when you are blind!

Innocent blood was spilled on the field
Giving you a new damned day
Would you celebrate
Achilles' end?
You are guilty and the sentence is death
Into the dark, fall into the dark!

Forevermore, your soul will scream in the Hades
And with the damned, the Stygian travel's just 
begun

"The end of this endless war,
I know,
It's coming as fast as the hourglass sand runs
I swear you will never go over these doors
You desecrate his body but not his heart"

Shadows on the walls
Blood is flowing away
Mourning for your strain
When ravens eat your body mixed with sand
Gods are laughing
For this sacrifice
You'll never rest in peace

You will see when you are blind 
fall into the dark!

Forevermore, you will enter 
the silence of Hades
Without rest
Full of pain
Forgotten for all time

"The end of this endless war,
I know,
It's coming as fast as the hourglass sand runs
I swear you will never go over these doors
You desecrate his body but not his heart"

Shadows on the walls
Blood is flowing away
Mourning for your strain
When ravens eat your body mixed with sand
Gods are laughing
For this sacrifice
You'll never rest in peaceLong ago a man he was
Now his name forgotten

Lord of the Black Land speaks through him
Once mighty but now fallen
Hiw own name forgotten

Once one of the mighty Dunadine
Corrupted by SauronA fog-ridden village in the distance, or the dales,
Now it is within reach, I follow gravel paths I built myself.
Spiritless I stride in torn coats, boots, ravaged by the battle,
So long have I yearned for the day of my return.

Who am I? No one, yet another
who was torn out of the phalanx
in the middle of a battle wehre I was needed most.
Leaden is my step, I am the captive of a leash,
knotted from the broken bodies of the comrades now out of reach.

Having been the truest servant of my kind,
I eft no path unburned, no bridge uncrushed behind.

War Beast, returning home...
Distant, far lands have I roamed.
A stranger from the past,
Hailing from times never meant to last...

Upon arrival I am hailed
As long lost sheep astray of the herd,
Astray of the fields and landmarks
Once again in front of

Empty eyes are staring into empty faces
I no longer yearn for to know me,
Disguised, disgusting, the wandering wolf, a starving pair of
Empty eyes
Are staring into empty spaces I no longer know,
So transparent seems waht once had made me grow.

Where to walk when the earth is burning?
Where to stand when the tide is turning?
Too long, too victorious have I ruled the fronts,
How ever to face the peace of old days
With a neck in the noose of the past,
Iron strings that fasten,
And Each new step lighter than the last...


The war beast, returning home...

I recall giving birth to what is known as scorched earth,
Now I see it was the ground I meant to cultivate.
Yet, I shall remain at war with time forever.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)We call you, eternal king - 
From wastelands of mud and sin, 
We bring you our sacrifice 
In great hope of your new rise. 

And then our evil howling 
will reach the depths of underworld. 
And wake the ancient power, 
That's dreaming in the deepest crypt. 
* 
We call you, black wind of mourn 
With great howl of Satan's horn. 
You're power that burns my heart, 
Creator of damned art. 

And then our evil howling 
will reach the depths of underworld. 
And wake the ancient power, 
That's dreaming in the deepest crypt. 
* 
"Veni, omnipotens aeterne Diabolus 
Veni, omnipotens aeterne Diabolus" 
* 
Crush the gates of heaven, 
Which hide path to Etherland - 
Let the Death show it's true power 
And lead false order to the end...Crno je nebo nad zemljom plakalo
Hiljade munji na tlo je padalo
Moju je dusu time rasporilo
U blatu i mulju vriskom je zaklalo!
Stepa je hladna srce mi grejala!
Zaklana dusa je trunuci stenjala
U mac je teski ona skovana
Poput stita,posred puknuta!
Zora me nezno u mukama grlila,
Majci Zemlji na grudi polozila!
Pogledaj me,zlatno Sunce,sto przis planine!
Secivima zlatnim sto paras visine!
Sahrani me sneze i ka grobu mom ti zatri put,
Otpozdravi Vetre moje duse zove,
Dok pod pragom camim,prikovan za rov!
Rasporen i slomljen!
I na svetlu zadavljen!
Odahnjujem mirno u cast soja svoga.
Dok vapaj moj tiho gusi zemlja...
...I cini ga cujnim
Samo onom sto nacini ga.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)We're leaving together, but still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back, to earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame, we're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown...

We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all
With so many light years to go and things to be found
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.

It's the final countdown...Thousands of years
I go back in my dreams
Thousands of whispers
And thousands of screams
Something is calling me
From beyond time
Something is calling me
From the other side

Chorus:

Sorceress - beauty and pain
Sorceress
Sorceress - embrace of flames
Sorceress

She's haunting me in my dreams
I have no doubt she was real
Her body burned to ashes
But her soul never found peace

Chorus...

Torment in fire

I see the dread in her eyes
Every night i can see her burning
In embrace of flames(Instrumental) 

	Now I've come, to conquer, and reclaim what is mine...
Taking this world is only a sign,
of what's to come, I will rule divine
Within the cosmos, with whom I'll bind...Die by the demon, die by my hand 
God is so mightless - I can't understand 

Satanic laughter fills your ears 
Did you ever so what hear 
Your brain explodes, i suck your blood 

Your body - rotting in the mud 
You can't stop the great ABSURD 
Know that the truth sometimes hurts 

The truth is that God soon will die 
Although he is the almighty 
He's got the might to die himself 
The creation raises against its creatorI have the beast beast on my side
I've got to go out tonite
Time to take take a dark ride
The tombs are in my sight
Blood is movin' movin' faster
To the place that I need
I am the Devil's Devil's master
As I spill the seed in the hot graves
Total lust lust for cold skin
Is what I have got
Keep on keep on sinnin'
As I smell them rotWhen energy will disperse in every directions 
Stars will explode 
Planets will collide and flames will strike the sky 
Vulkanos will be revided from their hundreds of years of dozing 
and boiling lava flow 
When icy claciors crack and oceans overflow 
The matter will split and disperse into space 
Then the freezing universe of infinity will swallow 
Up everything and the rule of darkness and ice will beginFrozen northern winds, full moon of the equinox
They predominate and illuminate, with total magnificence
The Ancestral Forest, unmemorable path era
Eternal dominion in veneration, and proclamation
From the beginning for the awakening, 
Tenuous light defining figures around the purification fire
Of the flaming circle light like and infernal thought increasing,
We intonate anthems, canticles and litanies
To adore and to invocated with songs of absolute power
And immemorial knowledge.

Under the somber of veil of the eclipsed night
Over forsaken lands of blood, tales and myths about the a false
And inert image of god!!!!!

Prostrated emanating tears of bitter
Pain and agony kneeling before you!!!

Oh, great master, creator of thunder and storm
Conquerors of fire and earth, dominators of seas and winds
We venerated you, lord of obscurity
Venerate your strength, your grandeur, your absolute knowledge
We reverence his gracious majesty.

Eternal dominion over the face of the universe, total predomination
Majestic over a pain and sorrow era
Only us his sons, will rule in his gracious name
Representation!!The faded day tends ends to an end
Colorful darkness turns black from red
The skies are breathing, they lose their cry
Upon the soil we were born and will die
The stone is broken, the leaves feel pain
A promise was stolen, a hope in vain
The forest's whispers faded away
Our darkness has come to take us away

It's a heresy
The traitor's tongue stabbed me so deep
We lost our friends, our hearts still beat
We're off for a search, a doubt to bend
A promise was made: "Till we reach our end!"
The branches shake in funeral dance
They try to warn us for approaching steps
An ambush is due to traitor's words
An ambush is due to traitor's words

It's a heresy

The salty blood that you can taste is the trace of our resistance
The fresh deep wounds that you can see are the path that you could follow
The salty blood that you can taste is the trace of our resistance
The last drop of blood that I can give till I fall, till I die

My glory is passing through victory
My bravery will be rewarded
One day I will pass all this misery
And free I will stand to this world 

I spent all my life into slavery
Hoping to see the next dawn
I am here to kill every enemy
And salute the man on the throne 

My dream is to travel in foreign lands
I have dreamed that long before
I'll try to forget all this blood on sand
And mournings will sound here no more 

But all these dreamed things are so far away
I'm only a gladiator
Perhaps these could be my last fighting days
And the crowd will shout for more 

MORITURI TE SALUTANT 

Under the stars
I see a vision a chariot of light
Heading towards me
And I realize it's time for me
To fly high in the sky
I hail you now as I die(Instrumental)Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast
In a field I looked into going past,
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,
But a few weeds and stubble showing last.

The woods around it have it--it is theirs.
All animals are smothered in their lairs.
I am too absent-spirited to count:
The loneliness includes me unawares.

And lonely as it is that loneliness
Will be more lonely ere it will be less
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow
With no expression, nothing to express.

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces
Between stars--on stars where no human race is.
I have it in me so much nearer home
To scare myself with my own desert places.Kenneth Robeson. You wrote some, of my favorite fiction
Like Doc Savage, The Avenger
So I don't even give a shit
That your name was just a surname
For thousands men's pens
In the thirties, I could buy your books for just ten cents
And you'd get what you paid for they were made for
PRE-PUBESCENT MALES!
They're the one only that I can read
When I rot in county jail!
Kenneth Robeson!
You wrote some of my favorite fiction.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Lyric by Triumphsword & Abyssius

Soldiers of the glory
Baptized by the pagan hate
Fight for honor and for the ancestral blood
They march in search of an ideal nobleman
The enemy manipulates the weak ones
The christian excoriate

And it's lay ones oppressed by the lie
Many fallen siblings in the battlefield
Die with pride defending their values!
That comes from the past
For our aid in this search for revenge!!!

We'll rise the pagan flag
Pagan seizing our thirsty
Weapons for the enemy blood!
We declared a new war!

The justice of the sword forged
In celtic steel!

We'll bring back the respec which was taken from us
The cold winds invoke our victory
The scenery of our victory!
We acclaimed  the wolves that want to defend our honor!

Call for the war, for the honor
Call for the war, storm of fire(Instrumental)Write in a store window, the girls watch your lobes flex
Still, no one could guess what you would write next
Like you might write just to read your own name
Your early work made good TV game
Still, no one could top you at your short fiction
No one could stop your dangerous visions
We wrote this song don't let it go to your head
You'd like it more if your name's all we said
Harlan, Harlan, Ellison!
Harlan, Harlan, Ellison!
A lot of people called you a prick
Maybe you talked a little shit 'bout Philip K. Dick
Mephisto In Onyx. Phoenix Without Ashes.
Couldn't write a real novel to save your ass!(Instrumental)Intertwining miserableness
 Consuming grace now darkening
 Everdimming light of holiness
 Forever now extinguished
 Abomination infesting and molding
 Realms obscure
 Fly into passages to forbidden scapes of perpetual rapture
 Absorb within mesmerizing pain...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Cry of Haro endlessly 
Destinatic response to thee
Cry of Haro piercingly
For injustice done to me
Cry of Haro eternally
End in forced entry

Swells of steam through ashes arise 
Fortell forthcoming deceptor's demise
Black dawn behold another false one
Scathe ye in a new millenniumAlone in my granite tower
I only feel sorrow and pain
May that be my last nightmare
May that be my last dream
The splendors of my lands belong to past and darkness
I am the last emperor of an earthless nation
The greedy modern nations submitted to deserts' religions had lead the fall of their world
Million men and only one brain
I am the armed arm of my great mother earth
I'll purchase the last survivors with the anger of my armies
I'll force them to scoff their money
I'll force them to drink their petroleum
I'll force them to eat their forests of concrete
I'll rape their deviant putrid morality
Heartless
Soulless and without mercy we'll be the arms of vengeance
Our goal is to kill and clean this decadent world and its remains
We'll build the new order on the ruins of decadence
The ashes will nourish the lands
The earth of eternal nature
May I be the last emperor
May the earth be the law
May heathen be the blood
May this past be forgotten!(Instrumental)Solitude
When does the loneliness end?
I am awaiting death in darkness for I'm alone.
In Solitude I want my life's end.

Where are you my wife to see my blood running out of me?
Where are you to feel my final breath?
Feel my love and hate me now for I am just pain for you.
Hate me and cover me with death.

I would rather be with you, be an father to my son.
The same black blood does run in our veins.

Hill NordvegIn the dark forest, beyond the lying mankind
where glittery streams run over moss covered stones
in forgotten caves where powerful secrets rest
that's where the lord of the heathens is waiting for the day
of retaliation

Lors of the heathens from the dark forests...

When fog covers the land, when the nights are moonless and cold
he'll stand in the middle of the grave-hills and he'll swing his old sword
the holy sword of the heathens, which sound will sing him crazy
in such nights the animals will hide, the dishounourable will forsee their death

The trees then sing him odd and fascination melodies
there are ancient entreaties, runic and elf magic
his eyes glow in the blue fire, with the promise to kill the fools
the wind carries his oath out of the forests - you can also hear him!Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; 
and I look downward because exalted I am. 

I love those who do not know how to live, except by going under, for they are those who cross over. 
I love him who lives to know, and who wants to know so that the overman may live some day. And thus he wants to go under. 
I love him who loves his virtue, for virtue is the will to go under and an arrow of longing. 
I love him who casts golden words before his deeds and always does even more than he promises: for he wants to go under. 

Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; 
and I look downward because exalted I am. 

I love him who justifies future and redeems past generations: for he wants to perish of the present. 
I love him whose soul is deep, even in being wounded, and who can perish of a small experience: thus he goes gladly over the bridge. 
I love him who has a free spirit and a free heart: thus his head is only the entrails of his heart, but his heart drives him to go under. 
I love all those who are as heavy drops, falling one by one out of the dark cloud that hangs over men: they herald the advent of lightning, and, as heralds, they perish. 

Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; 
and I look downward because exalted I am. 

Behold, I am a herald of the lightning 
and a heavy drop from the cloud; 
but this lightning is called overman.(Instrumental)I have an obsession for killing
I have an obsession with fucking dead bodies
I love to eat people alive
Hearing them scream watching them die

Chills running up your spine
Diseased sickened is my brain
Insane rituals of torture
Obsequious to murder my true love

Putrescent my mind is slowly rotting
Fantasies dead corpses in my bed
Ripped apart the bodies are at my feet
Butchered limbs dead children on my block

Tieing you to my rack pushing razorblades into your ass, wrapping your face in barbwire, setting your genitals on fire, dropping LSD in your eyes
Tripping through terror
Peeling the sking from your corpse
Pulling the veins from your limbs
Watching them die.You did pretty good for never having gone to college Ray...
But when I saw you on TV I felt you owed me an apology!
But not for..
Farenheit 451!
Not for... 
Something Wicked This Way Comes!
Not for...
Golden Apples of the Sun!
Not for...
Martian Chronicles, Book One!Moon, forest, blinding snow
My ancestors call me back home

Don't ask me who leads my steps
What made me follow this path
The thing I feel is older than any words
How can you dare to stop me now
Please, don't, I must go

Strange, moon shines slightly, just as little clouds allow
May inner enlightenment give me a sight of the day's clarity
Frost shivers my shoeless feet and tempts me to dance
The timeless dance with eternity

The last time I'm looking back with tearless regards
Well, I used to love it there
Last remembrance in a mind washed off pain and scars
Well, I used to suffer there

Strange, suddenly I understand, 
All the tones and words whispered to me
A breathtaking song of divine unity
Frost shivers my shoeless feet and tempts me to dance
The timeless dance with eternity

You may have used to know me, sorry if I'll be missed
But the feeling inside is a law
I must keep on this path despite only guessing its goal
Sorry my friends, I must go

Moon, forest, blinding snow
My ancestors call me back home(Instrumental)Through the labyrinths of wounded brain
Through the dark side of consciousness
I roam blindly, falling, stumbling
Along the verges of forbidden knowledge 
Like an explorer of mortal, fleeting flesh
That opens life's shell with a scalpel
By the flight of thought I slice the brain
In the name of lust for perverted death

I see evil
It lives on the other side
I hear evil
Calling to open the gates
I can tell you all about evil
Cause I am not afraid of
What you call Nightmare

I open the door to the gardens of secret pleasures
I cognize the orgasm of suffering
I smell the aroma of rotting flowers of my mind
Rejoicing in whatever lies beyond the border of comprehending

And like a pathologist
Pulling out the intestines
I extract outside
The beasts so strange residing in my mind

And the beasts begin to eat
The remnants of slavish trivial judgement
Relics of humanity
Everything that was a sin
And like a skillful trainer
Beasts of prey without fear
I feed them on the ashes of my mind
In morbid visions of mine

I see evil
It lives on the other side
I hear evil
Calling to open the gates 
I can tell you all about evil 
Cause I am not afraid of
What you call Nightmare(Instrumental)Temples of the holy bastard in the light
Muste be shattered
The Dead are rising to uphold the blackest task
They will be battered

Flesh is burning prepare for the shock
Crossess turning down shock till blood

Marching out from the catacombs of hell
Kingdoms falling
Bred to destroy children of the Christ
The reaper's calling

Flesh is burning prepare for the shock
Crossess turning down shock till blood

Corpse's scattered through the soiled sacred ground
Torn and bleeding
The hunger of devils soldiers never ends
Start the feeding

Flesh is burning prepare for the shock
Crossess turning down shock till blood(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hear my words
By ages forgotten
A voice from the past
Legends became dust

Surrounded by darkness... this earth
In the sea of endless space and stars
..once disappear..


As the ancient blades once will rise
in this pagan lands of the old

The enemies blood which will be spilt again over this damp earth
As the prophecies told
This ancient scrolls of stardust

When the last thunder will roar
Swords will clash once again
In the darkest of the nights on this battlefield
Under the pagan moon over this cold plain

Fire and doom in the sky
Return of the forgotten ones
The ones who gave wisdom and great power
Ancient rites
As this earth sinks in chaos, war and fire
Lost ancient times
Spirits of forsaken arise in the last nights!

Hear my words
By ages forgotten
A voice from the past
Legends became dust

Surrounded by darkness... this earth
In the sea of endless space and stars
..once disappear..

In the sea of endless space and stars
..once disappear..

When the last thunder will roar
Swords will clash once again
In the darkest of the nights on this battlefield
Under the pagan moon over this cold plain(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Lyrics: Ion)

My scream is frozen by the wind from North
My eyes are blinded by the endless night
Song of the storm tears flesh of my ears
Cold soil drinks last drops of my blood

In Hate is the secret of my might
Tumulus waits for me tonight
Will be the Day of Horned Lord
I will reborn to feed my Sword

My dreams are crushed by lies of your god
My mind injured by this hypocrite
I tried to attain eternal piece
Now I victim of mental disease

Visions come to me
I recognize them
Demons wait for me
They heard my war-cry

My Spirit leaves my body
I loose last drops of blood
Oh ,Father, take my Soul
To your eternal light!

Come down to sacred place
Of painful memories!
Walk through this trace!
Wipe out this disease!

There is only darkness in my mind!
I'll reborn to crush your shoddy Jesus Christ!Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Sounding gun, on they run through the endless grey
On the fight, for they are right, yes, by who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test there their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsBurnt alive in a barn 
They were two thousand internees 
For six days and nights an agonizing exodus 
Assassinated on the road, enclosed in waggons 
Deportees must be liquidated 
At the sixth day thousand rescued 
Agglutinated in the barn 
Burn them all in a barn 

Last massacre (6x) 

The floor was covered with straw 
And the straw impregnated with oil 

The doors closed and barricaded 
Soldiers set fire with torches 
Flames rised up, imploring howlings 
Petrified, roasted alive 
Burn them all in a barn 

Last massacre (4x) 

Machine guns crackled, 
All the sick slashed 
Decomposed, harrowing cries 
A pile of corpses burnt to death 
Howlings, moanings, rattles and groans 
Seven hours of debauchery 
The most disgusting crime in history (2x)Bright life time is speeding up
 My bird is rushing
 Steel wings instead of my hands
 No! I will smash them

 The height is the battle
 My majestic battle
 And without this battle I will die
 The height is the battle
 My majestic battle
 In the battle I only can fly
 Razing them to the ground!

 Are heroes like arrows
 The life is proud but the warriors die young

 Once more I have hit the mark
 My foe is burning
 Respite... but it never stops
 I'm always learning

 The height is the battle
 My majestic battle
 And without this battle I will die
 The height is the battle
 My majestic battle
 In the battle I only can fly
 Razing them to the ground!

 Are heroes like arrows
 The life is proud but the warriors die young
 My war is the height now
 War spirit I hail
 I am like a rider
 From most ancient tales
 Like retaliation
 I am falling down
 I'm take them to hell
 If I have to die young!

 The height is the battle
 My majestic battle
 And without this battle I will die
 The height is the battle
 My majestic battle
 In the battle I only can fly
 Razing them to the ground!

 Are heroes like arrows
 The life is proud but the warriors die youngThus the third awakening began
The hordes were prepared
For the final attack

Feeding on revenge and hate
Forged by the greed of the master
spreading diseases where they passed
A burning trail of misery and death
Even the wise were forced to flee
Those left turned towards the dark
Nothing is evil in the beginning
But the shadows are cast everywhere

Power is taken from the dying kings
Forged into one envious being

From the blood soiled ground
New evil is sculpted
The newborn brotherhood of hate
Nine worshippers of merciless carnage
The foulest beasts carry them
Through icestorms and summer plague
Tearing all beauty down
That encounters their path

A burning trail of misery and death
Those left turned towards the dark

After the third coming
Chaos reigned the land
Scorched by fire breath
One last battle

Honour and pain
Fearing no light
Everlasting triumph
Hail the unbornDark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose you track
Can't go on but you can't go back
You know me etc.

Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil's hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down
You know me etc.From the mists of creation
The warrior spirit has followed
Through the veins of europeans
Waiting to be reawakened
Waiting to be released
To restore our true identity
In these days of increasing chaos
We enter the cycle of death
The foreign religions
And christianised faiths
These cultural diseases
That plague our race
Ancient heathen ways
Have been scorned
Our ancestors faiths
Will be restored
The blade of destruction we wield
Devastation our foes shall feel
Fires will burn
And up from the ashes shall rise
Rebirth of our heritage
Our destiny our culture
Life, destruction, renewal
Hail, Hail, HailA feared barbarian warrior
Arrived from the could northern lands
A man- beast, slayer a hungry wolf stalking his prey
Owned the steel hardly beaten by anyone
Earned his fame on the cruelest of quests
Looted and destroyed
with no one to tame his fervour and rage

wealthy catch of gold and steel
and also a usual salt for his meat

Later on the beast merged his blood with the eastern pagan pack
To conquer vast lands, leaving the trail almost everywhere
Swept all who stood in his way
Ransaked temples, cities and towns
Killed all, no exceptions
All that remained was burnt dust

wealthy catch of gold and steel
and also a usual salt for his meat

The man fought in armor or naked to the point of exhaustion
No one was found on the earth to break his strength

Trudging and falling with weariness
He kept going on and nothing could stop him
With a sword cut he stood up
Again and again, like a dreadful ghost(Instrumental)I wanna fuck our neighbour.
Hear her cries.
I wanna feel her warm hole around mine.
Her husband can see us there.
I Hope Not...Smelling the sweat, hearing the cry, I'm standing up with my men 
All together in the sand of the field, we are waiting for our death 

And the men yell the cry of the beginning of the end of our lives ! 

We're fighting for blood and glory 
We are here to join the Valhalla 

Smelling the sweat, hearing the cry, I'm standing up with my men 

And the sword cutting the arms of the men who dare fighting me
I release the beast in me, I'm feeding with the blood of men 
I'm raving with the battle's slaughter, I feel my soul quaking my head 
I can't control myself any longer, I am the berserk inside you 

I am the blood of wars coming from ancient times 
You should fear me 'cause I'm here for you 
I am the herald of death coming to never rest 

And the men yell the cry of the beginning of the end of our lives ! 

We're fighting for blood and glory 
We are here to join the Valhalla 

And the sword cutting the arms of the men who dare fight me 
I release the beast in me, I'm feeding with the blood of men 
I'm raving of the slaughter of battle, I feel my soul quaking in my head 
I can't control myself any longer, I am the berserk inside youShades of the past are reviving 
Rising the cross of hatred 
Reborn from the evil's ashes 
Are teaching the lie 
Dressed in black

Different faith? {{INTO THE FIRE}} 
They give you a chance: 
the church or the hangman, 
But you have to live 
Chorus: 
Holy gates are closed behind you 
hidin' inside dirty laws 
Turn the page 
that's written by a false mind 
In the name of Rose 
How many great minds are wasted? 
Been accused by wizards wrongly, 
Replacing the dreams to nightmares 
And smiles to painEvil eyes stare at you, you're strapped to a hospital bed 
Try to break free and your mind begins to twist, as unknown chemicals flow through your head 
Anastasia, and your vision begins to dim 
The scalpel enters.. and darkness closes in

Music: Alessandro Takassaki / Lyrics: Bruce Baiochi

My eyes are closing
Now i am in the solitude
Wich i will be the day

I am condemned to suffer
On these sad days of winter
Where the sun will doesn't shine

Chorus:
My death will be glorious
And everything is done for me
My destiny will be sealed
And my legend lives on

I look at me and see
A man that is dying
Without mercy without fear

I am alone in silence
Feeling the pain of the past
Waiting the moment to cross the sky

Chorus:
Chorus:From the clatter of hooves of our battle horses
Trembles and shakes all our Earth,
And thousands of arrows, which covered the sun
For enemies carry death.
And being ready to conquire or die in the fight
We're gonna seize all world
Brave and ruthless, proud and wild,
Barbaric hordes from North.
Our swords are sharpened
Our spears are strong
And nothings gonna save the enemies
We're gonna make the greatest feast
On their broken bones
And drink their blood as wine.
Wild march has begun and quite soon
We'll bring to the knees all that world
Great and evil, true and strong
Barbaric hordes from North.(Instrumental)Icy wind is blowing between my lips
Wine went sour, froze in my mouth 
Together with water in the caves of eternity. 
... Thousands of transparent stalactites ... 
I can't see why they resound with love songs 
Full of perversity 
And I don't know why under their glance 
I always find so much despair. 
I must enter the womb deeper 
Before its heart is frozen. 
I must find the elemental furnace, 
To sacrifice to its limpid fire 
And to go up in flames. 
I must feel the force 
As once in a premonition of bloodshed, 
Otherwise we will burn out like sparks 
Shot into the depths of night.All dressed in gold and purple the beauty awaits the night
Knowing what will satisfy
Aware of Her delight
The thought of young fresh blood makes the hours go so slow
But the yearn for eternal life and beauty makes her hazelbrown eyes glow

Elizabeth Bathory......

Now the hour is comed, the time is right for the feast to take its roll
And by the sunrise 60 bodies will be found raped from their blood and souls
The beauty patiently selects the victims for the night
Innocent blood will give eternal beauty eternal life

Woman of Dark Desires
Woman of Eternal Beauty
Woman of Dark Desires
Elizabeth Bathory......

Now the life you have lived have comed to light and unfold is your perversity.
Now the end is near still death is real
No more beauty or life for eternity
Cold walls entombs your secrets but there's nothing you regret
Embrace death with a smile as the highlands face sunset

Elizabeth Bathory......The Children of the Carpathian Woods (Werewolf Monarchy)
(music by Nathuruss, lyrics by Vidar)

The kingdom Siebenburgen opens
Spreads its shade 'cross Carpathian night,
Nocturnal howling from the distance,
In the woods sparkling dimmed lights,
The Children of the night now gather,
Expect their feast of flesh and blood,
Escort the carriage on its way to darkness,
Darkness named after Dracul Vlad...

Illusions of mortal kind, Symphonies of desires blind,
I offer thee an everlasting life for draught of nectar from the veins of thine,
Obsessed with the brightest candle shine cherish Satan's whores and the reddest wine...
Thy blood is what I desire most,
I am the virus and thou art my host...

The Children of the Carpathian Woods...
Spread his spell across the land
The Children of the Carpathian Woods...
In the Yearning thoughts remain.

Shadows dance 'pon the walls of the castle
as Luna comes 'rom'hind the clouds,
The embrace of a werewolf, freezing winter,
Silence thrills as moonlight children cry...
In expectations of the Winter Solstice
howling arias to the Queen of Doom
Ethereal spirit disappears with the new dawn
knowing that the twilight shall come soon...

Illusions...

The Children of the Carpathian Woods...
Genocide in the Wolverine breed
The Children of the Carpathian Woods...
Sow the true Carpathian seed.

Shining brighter than Sirius, my spirit comes to thee...Welcome my Brothers of Metal
We're standing ready to strike
Come close to the stage and go maniac
Cause we're about to smash you with Thrash

Thrash Or Die!!!
Thrash Or Die!!!
Thrash Attack!!!

This is a call for you all
Jump in the pit and go mad
Let us destroy your soul
With our violent attack

Thrash Or Die!!!
Thrash Or Die!!!
Thrash Attack!!!

Behold the madness and destruction
No need to follow no rules
Keep running down in the circle of life
For you'll soon be reaching your doom

In our journey there's no way back
Let nuclear destruction come
Thrashers are thirsty for vengeance
And the disaster is done

Thrash Or Die!!!
Thrash Or Die!!!
Thrash Attack!!!Many things are coming to a change,
my mind and my way of seeing life.
I am in an atmosphere
That reveals to be a chaosphere

Why do I try to lie to my soul...

Reality is mutated by my brain
Capacity of reflection is enchained
Something hypnotic is controling me
by a suspect sensuality

Why do I obey to something so mystical

Reality mutated
by my innocence
Hypnotic dream
this mystical speach

Innumerable lies destined
to deviated evolution
The truth resides in me
and in my instinctive actions

now I know purity and wisdom

Lies are annihilated
by my good conscience
Hypnotic dream
This mystical speach...

Results of ancestral cults
Waiting for the final fight
For your blood and your land
You are the Black Metal knights
Sons of the dragons of the north
Deny all the books of lies and their feeble weak sons
This putrid humanity and this bastard society
Spit on this world of weakness build on debasing rules
You mighty Black Metal knights lords of the only holy fightNo forgiveness, no mercy
We are the barbarians
I dream of million bodies strewing the battlefield
Ripped up by the blades of vengeance
Spilling their decaying guts in the grass
Fertilizing my lands and forests
The harvesting will be better next year
We are the pagan legions in the employ of ourself
I see thousands cadavers of those hippie vermines
Gutted up to throat of their sacred ecstasy
No tolerance toward this polluting waste
No rave parties on my land
They are the parasites they are the weakness
Subculture for drugs addictedsI've found my treasure
one day I felt the joy
I've found my luck
in the eyes of my son
but as fast as he appeared
came the farewell
as fast as he approached
he had to leave me

Theseus!
Give me a sign!

I am standing upon the cliff
looking at the horizon
is it white or is it black?
I want to know
is my son a hero
or am I alone?

times are passing by
still there is no answer
times are running 'round me
I am standing still
the blue of the ocean
becomes the blue of the sky
the darkness from my soul
becomes the darkness of the night

is he alive?
is he dead?
a fathers burden / where are you?
sons legac / Theseus!

there is the ship
but what is this?
the sails...
no, this is the wrong colour
what has happened on Crete?
what has Minos done?
was he ripped apart by it,
the dreadfullness of a foolish wife?

my son,
no

King Aegeus, stroken by grief
fell to death in the blue sea
from now on it shall bare his name
in remembrance of the heir
who though cameEvery evening awaiting the night 
I afraid of what to become 
Things I have to see in a dream 
And the ones who waiting me there 
Afraid to sleep defenseless I am 
There's no force to suppress them 
Their will is over my mind 
Their will is only to kill 

But now Morpheus overcomes 
As I cannot open my eyes 
Ailing peace possesses me whole 
Unreality's the end of this path 
"Come with us," whisper I hear 
"Don't be afraid you are in a dream 
The forbidden fruit of the murder 
You have to learn to get out of here" 

And I move submitted to an alien will 
Someone puts the knife in my hand 
Peering into the night with another's eyes 
Looking for a victim in the dark 
Consoling oneself it is only nightmare 
In the morning everything will be gone 
So the next night I'll try to 
Not to sleep, not to make a wrong

Now the morning came, voices left me 
Sun is rose I see it with my eyes 
But the blood covers my hands 
Blood of my next in turn sacrifice

I know I did it not to stay there, 
In the dark...

And again Morpheus overcomes 
As I cannot open my eyes 
Ailing peace possesses me whole 
The reality's the end of this path(Instrumental)Intelligent creation 
Man-made hive 
Manifest destruction 
Line by line 

Swarm with pieces 
Programmed distribution 
Pervasive infection 
No control 

System overload.. 

Detect the swarm 
Impossible 

Control the swarm 
Impossible 

Avoid the swarm

Artificial colony 
Self-organized 
Sudden invasion 
Exceeding eruptionFimbulvetr now has come
None are spared through winters three
Age of Sun is gone..
Come now forth unto the end
Long have we prepared our swords
For this final day

Brothers will fight
bringing death to each other
Sons of sisters
will split their kin bonds..
Age of axes, age of swords,
shields split,
wind age, wolf age
until the world falls into ruin

No more the Sun.
No more the Moon.

Fatters shaken from the earth
Unleashing the deadly foes..

The ship of nails is come
Bane of gods unbound
Sons of Muspell ride behind
A sword as of the Sun

One hundred leagues in every path
The field of battle lies cold and still
Long foreseen the fate of all
Shall be unveiled on the final day

...And finally the mighty
Gjallarhorn resounds
With fear but strength the
fallenones go on towards the end...

Cometh now the final day
Fate awais us on the field
Glorious or fell
Come now forth unto the end
Long have we prepared our swords
For this final day

Absence of the mighty sword
Will be the bane of Frey
Slain by that which shines so bright
Hel's hound, great and fell
Challenges the bravest God
Together they fall

Thunder God and his old foe
Are each other's bane
And finally the ancient wolf
Swallows the Old Wise One..

Odin's son goes to fight with the wolf,
Vidar on the way
to the carrion beast;
he lets his sword
hew to the heart
of Hvedrung's son
Thus the father is avenged

The sun grows black,
the earth sinks into the sea
The bright stars
vanis from the heavens
Steam surges up
and the fire rages.
Heat reaches high
against heaven itself...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)There once was a maiden who danced on the way,
as fair as the Summer sun on Midsummer's day.
Her food was the birdsong that played where she ran
and her mead was the dew-drops that covered the land.
Her cloak, it was coloured the emerald green,
and her crown was the sunlight on gold flowing streams.
Her love was as wide as the eagles did roam
and her heart was the hearth fire that all men called home.

But a new king arose in a foreign land;
sought to rule the whole world by his conquering hand.
Such power and glory he spread in his seed,
yet a rose in a cornfield is always a weed.
In lust for a new life men abandoned their own,
and their swords were the plough by which "good seed" was sown.
Alone sat the maiden, such teardrops she cried
as she buried her children along with her pride.

Now her green cloak they've taken and covered with grey,
for its ripped and its torn and its splattered with clay.
Her crown it lays tarnished from poisons they've spilled,
laid her open wide, let each map take his fill.
Yet she longs for the day when she'd once more be free,
when those that torment her return cross the sea,
or burn in the fires oft foretold of old,
for she'll dance on their ashes afore they're ere cold.Spoedt U Wodan, zal Mimir's bron verlichting brengen?
Schone levenslust is overmand door blindheid en verraad!
Een onschuldige twijg is onze dood gebleken.
Tranen niet gelaten bezegelden ons lot.
Wildar's daad verandert niets!

Het licht des levens is verbannen naar het rijk der mist en duisternis.
Hel's kille hand beroert daar zijn dode ziel.
Terugkeerde Hermod grauw en triest niet in staat het lot te keren.

Broeder bloed bevlekt de zwaarden, speertijd, zwaardtijd schilden splijten.
Windtijd, wolftijd eer de wereld vergaat geen enkel mens zal de ander sparen!

Reuzenvuisten balden knokkels wit. De angstwind waait over Midgaard's vlakten.
De levensboom siddert, schokt en zucht. Fenrir's kettingen breken
hij is vrij!
Muspel's zonen vertrappen de aarde, de leugen God die zal hen leiden.
Moordkaak zal Alvader breken als 't vlammend zwaard de laatste dageraad inluidt.In this world, in this place
I'm just a lonely stranger
in these times, in these days
my heart is filled with anger
in this world, in this maze
I loose myself in anger!

Drowning in the dark of my thoughts
all the way down to the core
there I fight a battle that I fought
a hundred, a thousand times before

And in the end I loose again
and in the end I loose again
and in the end I loose again
and in the end I loose myself in anger!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Over the land blackness reigns 
All who enter shall be slain 
In thy village full of pain 
Tis here they walk 
Tis here they rule 
Tis here they fight 
Tis here they kill 
Until dawn we walk 
Til vision of the hawk 
The sign which shows 
The evil men stalk 
Those who want 
To take over their rule 
And capture the village 
The village so cruel 
And bring back life 
To this town 
And make it their own 
To rule by crown 
In thy village 
Not a soul lay awake 
Fog creeps over 
rain pours down 
Lightning strikes 
With ferocious sound 
Until the day revenge takes place in the village 
...the village so cruel...Burn the skeleton of Gods child
Let the rest of him disappear in open air
As smoke from the stake
His soul turn to nothing
And his spell that blessed the earth
Dies with him
You can't see a thing that reminds me of him
Earth is malignant once again
This is the dark age... Never ending horror
And fear for existence
Gods men on earth have left
(Christians) you have no longer your faith
Your God is dead
A victory and feast for the Devils men
No more times in glory
No weakness can harm this earth again
The earth was never ment for his glory
It was meant for us and the Devils path
We will watch you... God
We will watch you do the same mistake
We will watch your moves
As raven high above earths surface
We will be ready and the next time you try
To conquer the world by sending your child
Well he die while he still lies in the cradle
God is wasted...
His son has been removed from the soil
Burn the child...
Let him never get his hands on this earth again
GOD IS WASTEDIn this dismal night
I will destroy the light
Possessed by forces of the dark
Demons of stardust by my side

I summon you, ravens of lunar shadows!
Spirits of the mystic lunar dimness
This world shall know your greatness
Masters of the fierce winter

Bring me the eastern storms
Bring me the eastern cold
I summon in the name of the ancient moon
The forgotten blackness
As crows, my servants
Lead me through the forests of my own world
Show me the destruction of light!

When the last shine of the sun will be gone
Forces of darkness will conquer this sphere
Pure blackness will dominate
Death to the light!

In this dismal night
I will destroy the light
Possessed by forces of the dark
Demons of stardust by my side(Instrumental)Darkening souls deviate under the funeral woods
where the truth lies behind silent eyes of the trees,
Lurking behind the blackness barks the eternal cold of woe
stares empty at those born from the shadows
that carpet of darkness,

Brittleness of the life that so dwells here
haunted by the light's of the feast of thorns, 
Together, under the never-ending twilight
shall cast the beam into the void to the eastern haunting,

Hallowed these grounds be of the tapestry 
woven by threads of fate and abysmal blackness, 
A yellow trace cracks the tarnished mirror above
that obstructs the rays from unholy cosmos, 
summon my spirit far past the grounds
tainted by the blood of futile black,

Divine eternal immolation 
under the under wretched stars
that never seem to spark their light,
Primordial acts of burial among darkness
under the illumination of the crucible-
The funeral moon,


(All lyrics are property of Ravenhelm)Like skeletal fingers of undying corpses
The black shapes of trees grasp the cloud laden sky
This cold winter night amongst all nature's forces
I spit on this cruel life and lay down to die

And no-one shall witness my peril

The moon's mocking face seems to smile at my anguish
As my hot salty tears melt the cold frozen snow
Soon my blood joins this flood as my body will perish
And will nourish the soil on the ground down below

And the pain of this life is forgotten

The gale nightwind sends shivers of cold down my spine
And it feels like my heart, like a dead lump of ice
Lady, I promised, all my life should be thine
But the gifts that you gave were just pitiful lies

Now watch and collect what is faithfully given

Girl, you revel in beauty, in passionful pleasures
Whilst denying that freaks are able to feel
What remains for myself out of life's golden treasures
Is a small sharpened razor of glittering steel

Thy rememberance will cease with the season

The deep lake's silver mirror shows what I will abandon
A grotesque monstrosity punished by fate
Love is reserved for the fair and the handsome
What's left for a mishappen shape is just hate

And slowly the lake freezes overObsessed by moon's bright gleam
bearer of lycantrhropic spell
gruesome, cold and majestic
forred to leave his human shell

In forests, deep and hidden
embraced by cruel coldness
inviking sinister reality
as he takes away your breath

Hunting at night

Cruel bitternes is in his heart
damned to walk at night
forever, he hunts alone
wanderer of twilight

Breed of immortality
spawn of the shadowside
following fullmoons call
no mercy left inside

Hunting at night

Fiery rage burning in his eyes
craving for blood and flesh
a nightmare to the mortals
helpless screams of death

Unleashed the wolf inside
beast of prey within
werewolf, ruler of the night
descendand of ancient kin

Hunting at nightAs a leaf carried by the winds, in cold autumn dusk
As the oak broken by fury of the storm
My roots will remain on these lands, where I was born
And in death, these leaves will cover my grave

As a path blinding my sight of azure and snow
As a light guiding my way towards the stars

Stand on the shores in the heat of flames
To honour your brave and his memory
Swear to this man to cherish his land and his legacy
Sworn to the elders

As the breeze blowing my soul in icy kingdoms
As a crow diving into the underworld

Stand on the shores in the heat of flames
To honour your brave and his memory
Swear to this man to cherish his land and his legacy
Sworn to the elders

Sword on side, shield on chest, my soul will drift away
Above the frozen lake
Choirs resound from the shores, blessing my departure
Towards infinite pits

My body burns in fires, released in heathen rites
Onwards to the nine worlds in the glare of the pyre

Raise your spears to the sky in an iron arch
Honour your ancestors
Bards sing my glory in funeral chants
Forefather of the tribe

My body burns in fires, released in heathen rites
Onwards to the nine worlds in the glare of the pyre

Into these lands of sorrow where the claws of time freeze my soul
Gathered with ancients the spirit of our clan is to be preserved

I feel eternity creeping into my whole being disembodied
The fear of the unknown as I vanish into the fog

Blessed be the memory of those who were the fathers of our culture
These glorious ancestors will guide our march to celestial realms

Into these lands of sorrow where the claws of time freeze my soul
Despite the solitude and cold I feel the ardour of my sons

For my blood and memory in their veins will forever flow
And when the time will come for them I will be there to wait them allBorn from wrath
A new dawn will rise up and never end
Sun will paint my banner red
And bleed on my right hand
Fireswords raising to those smokelike clouds
Mankind's age silently mourns...

... as i bear the fire banner!

Today... daylight won't shine,
This date... is mine!
Light and darkness
United in endless...

War!

Born from the fire
A new age will tear down their scum
Under this new creation's dawn
The march will begin
What they once called demons
Will feast again
In the honour of their godess' reign...

... and hail the fire banner!What is wrong? What is right?
Where is the sense of our lives?
In this world of sin and darkness
I stand on the streets and look around
Illusions screen our sight
Wait in the hall without a doorway

You lose your mind
Destiny is signed
You lose your mind

This is the day
Too late to pray
Fallen angels are burning in flames

Stuck in the time
Your end has come
Afraid of punishment for all wicked sons

This is the day

Trapped in the goal of your lust
There is no one who you can trust
Embrace of death, fear flows away
Yesterday's dreams are like a wreck in the sea
Irrevocably in oblivion
Will memories of me remain?

You lose your mind
Destiny is signed
You lose your mind

This is the day
Too late to pray
Fallen angels are burning in flames

Stuck in the time
Your end has come
Afraid of punishment for all wicked sons

This is the dayAs my inexistence escapes into this abyss
Searching for the mysteries of darkness
When the last snow felt
It will turn black as the rising dead sun

Hidden in shadows
Under crystal clear mystic sky
A sacred place absorbing the light
Spirits of dead sun guarding the temple of endless obscurity
	
Cold thoughts burden here since thousand lunar nights
When the dead sun arise, 
A storm of crows
Spreading with its fearless eyes..
..the beauty of darkness..

A forever lasting funeral of daylight. 
Sinking in old tears of grief
as the ancient winds have told
this night will never end!

As my inexistence escapes into this abyss
Searching for the mysteries of darkness
When the last snow felt
It will turn black as the rising dead sun

..It will turn black as the rising dead sun...I hear the voices of the trees which crown
the mountains, resting upon the 
wooden cloak. The tired and numb...
leaving the blood running
through my veins, and feeling
the sound of thoughts
flowing like the boulder's River.
The soul of forest shave me and trespass me
his wisdom and visions. 
The Path get's loss in the fanthomless
darkness of the night, and left look it's rake to
those eyes which beholds from
the High. Inclement, marble astral domes.
I summon the spirits of forefathers to reach
the stars, the strenght of those
who felt in the uproar of battle.Dark is everything
Cold and fire surrounding it all
Flames melting ice
A battle that has to finish at all

Frozen emptiness
Ginnungagap is just a deep, black hole
Burning darkness
Life takes form when the hot meets the cold

There is Niflheim
Valleys and mountains are made of no stone
There is Muspelheim
Rivers of magma destroying the whole

Frost giving him life
He was born from
Heat, filling the air
Now he has taken form

Ymer the giant
First living creature, born from the snow
Horrible fate
Betrayed and beheaded by (the) children of Bor

That's the beginning
Fighting for life, absence of love
Violence and nonsense
From dark to light, from nothing to all

That's our story
Ginnungagap hole is our hole
Snow and fire
Creators of our own

Of our own

That's our story
Ginnungagap hole is our hole
Snow and fire
Creators of our ownAsen:
War'n deine Augen auch Lichtes Feind
Hilf uns eh Unheil sich gegen uns vereint
in einzig Wesen, das nicht Trauer zeigt
Und Balder muss bleiben in Hellias ReichRevulsed, consumed eyes 
Pouring little rain, and thousand of flies 'round
Let me laugh at pain
Never felt it so hard 
You only feel alive
When you're madly hurt
Oh Hell, I am, I am alive
Alive, never felt so good today, I feel that I can replay
Alive, my head is about to break
Fuck the facts, I'm alive

Hundreds of crossroads lie in my head 
Rushours everytime 
I can't find my highway
I just wanna fly
Fly over my own buildings
Give my hand to the sky
Sleeping in the arms of the wind
And fly, and fly, and fly, so high"Welcome show my friend 
Welcome show that never ends
Left is walrus horn
To the right of child unborn
Welcome show my friend
Welcome show that never ends
You will be the one
Who controls the Moon and Sun

The reflections die
As the vision clears
But five pints will be enough
To deceive the seer
You will laugh and cry
As you take this beer
Satisfaction guaranteed
In the hall of mirrors

First you are a god
Perfect son of mighty lord
Peoples kneel to you
As you teach them what to do

Poor little man 
No one just comes near
You are hanging on the cross
Waiting for the spear
You predicted faith
Vanished human fears
But your destiny is naught
Just another mirror

Farewell mighty god
Only son of superb lord
You were little fake
Slaughtered only by mistake
Now it's time to laugh
Please begin don't shut your mouth
You were funny guy
Didn't know where to die

Here in distorting mirror
You are a dandy hero
Yes you can sit on the throne
Yes you can kneel all day long
While in the hall of mirrors 
While in the shade of heroes
You may keep silence or shout
But you will find no way out

Look at the perfect mirror
You see a shadow near
Yes shadow sits on the throne
Yes others kneel all day long
While in the den of mirrors
While as the whip comes near
You may have brandy or stout
But you will find no way out

Now you are a king
With a crown and mighty ring
Or to say precise
Now I'm telling only lies
You are lord of Wake
Half of mankind you had slayed
Welcome mighty knight
To the land of crystal night

poor mustached man
Devastaion near
You are gulping yellow pill
So your death is here
You controlled the world
Was the greatest fear
But your destiny is naught
Just another mirror

Farewell mighty king
With no crown or superb ring
You had fought enough
So your fate is brought for naught

All is brought for naught
In distorted mirror
All you hear is what you want
In the howl of zeroes 
Through the looking glass 
Welcome baby hero
Join your corpse on other side
Poor little zero

Welcome show my friend 
Welcome show that never ends
Left is walrus horn
To the right of child unborn
Welcome show my friend
Welcome show that never ends
You will be the one
Who controls the Moon and Sun

Now as you broke the mirror 
You killed a shade of hero
Yes no one sits on the throne
But they still kneel all day long
Here in the grave of mirrors
You are a perfect zero 
You may keep silence and shout
But you will find no way out(Instrumental)Raise your flaming sword from the abyssic south
To bring forth world's downfall
Chaos, destruction, extinction, rebirth
By fire, midgard shall be cleansed

The old earth has to fade away
To give place for the new creation
In the glowing splendour of muspels fire
The essence of the cosmic order is revealed

Order emerging from chaos
Life from death
Extinction leads to resurrection
Out of ruins the new world shall ariseSatan, Father
Help me from this grave
Demons, Warriors
Ever be my slaves
'Cause I can't reason
With men and mortal fools
They will die hard,
Hear the golden rule

Die Hard
Legions iron and steel
Die Hard
Men of war reveiled
Die Hard
Captors of the Brave
Die Hard
Die Hard

Sinner, liar
Guard your crown of thorns
Priestess, Parson
Live your life of scorn
I can ride the fires
Of Hell and blasphemy
We can grow strong
Satanic royalty

Evil, angels
Vultures of the night
Ride the wings of Hades
Death is on our side
Furnace burnin' bright
'Cause we ain't getting tiredFor all of us devised images 
For all of us prepared a rein 
Golden chariot waiting for Kings 
Faster pave the way by bodies 

Every day you are brainwashed 
And there pored a new batch of shit 
Manipulation of the zombie nation 

controlled and manipulated 
Chains, shackles on your hands 
You get paid for your silence 
When throwing sand into your eyes 

jump for joy - get a treat 
Tomorrow will get more 
like all does not stand out from the crowd 
and you will be happy 

Every day you are brainwashed 
And there pored a new batch of shit

Bad puppets to be rippd openO' mighty Lord of the Night

Thou whose presence dweleth in every shadow Thou who strengthen the power of every quietus Thou who sway every plague and storm 
Harkee. Thou art the Emperor of Darkness 
Thou art the king of howling wolves 
Thou hath the power to force any light in wane 
Sans mercy. Sans compassion nor will to answer whosoever asketh the why 
Thy path is capricious but yet so wide 
With no such thing as an impediment too strong Every time thou consecrate me to another secret of Thine 
I take another step towards Thy Pantheon 
Forever wilt I bleed for Thee 
Forever wilt I praise Thy dreaded name 
Forever wilt I serve Thee 
Thou shalt shalt forever prevailRain of blood has painted the ground
Screams of death and a crying sound
Heading for another day
Of glory
They were standing at their own graves
As the fire arrows waves
Rusty steel and the spears
Around them
Making history right here
Running wild without fear
Their last stand on this
Battlefield
Clearing south and the east
Braveless heart like a beast
The land is ours
They've cried!

They're our fathers,
They're our idols,
From them we got our lives
For them we'll die too!
They're our history
The're our guidance
For them we are free
For them we'll die free!

The time of battles now has gone,
Drink from the horns until the dawn
In the name of the
Victory
Hail the spirits in the sky,
Watch the hungry eagles fly
Standing just like they were
United!
Setting south and the east
Victorous heart like a beast
The land is ours

Reap whirlwind of pest.Living, dead and dying 
We stand covered by Black shroud 
We await the moon and wind 
Fire burning on the altar 
Burnt the incautious spirits 
By it's red glare, awoke the magic stones 
We've united good and evil 
We've created the highest power 
Magic and might of dark blood 
Blood from the scars of wounded Gods 
Runes engraved by Devils 
Besmeared by the Black Blood 
In the Glare of furious lightning's 
Spell of the damned runic words 
Altar of uncoagulated blood 
Altar surrounded by the women-wolves 
The words pledged to moon 
We repeat incantations written in blood 
Spirits come and walk among us 
We curse their fear and awe 
We curse our mercy 
May my soul burn in the fore of purity 
Evil wind tears the trees 
Moon hidden over the clouds 
Black smoke teases our eyes 
Burnt blood charms by it's smell 
Night of the ultimate darkness 
Elected it's sacrifice, it's tribute 
Feeding by our fear and our painGather in the midnight hours
Chant and drink and feast away
After casting spells in daylight
Mental disturbances pain devours
A familiar friend companion
To never go without one
A peaceful sleep diversion
To change the degree of ocean's sun

Fists fired to the air, swords to the wind
Glory welded to our hearts, to fight this battle that we're in!

Gather in the midnight hours
Chant and drink and feast away
After casting spells in daylight
Mental disturbances pain devours
A familiar friend companion
To never go without one
A peaceful sleep diversion
To change the degree of ocean's sun

Grasping onto my heart from far away
Rust of nails penetrate my veins from wounds he made
Freeze and run again, scars heal within
And to hold myself up, by my own hand!

I've died this death before
A number to add to the score
Once you've been the rock on which they stand
Then you know the battle hymn of the motherland!(Instrumental)Bloody razor in the palm of my hand
Deep in the night
There is no one in my world
To tell me what is right
I am Satan I am God that is the truth
Never seen another way there is no proof
Servant of no one
It's so useless to go on now
What is it worth
Be the master of your own destiny
And leave this earth
Torn flesh gives me delight
The blood I must see
I am my only master
Who can set me free(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Crystal horn that sang in the morning
 Wake up children of the enemy
 They raise the flag on the bloody lords
 Who perished much centuries ago
 And sun is turning round utter dark
 And crying moon's lying on the rack
 And dogs of war are stern on the track
 They glad to see baneful ages back

 Like a flowers in barren place
 Appeared as if what the people says
 Showing signs of all living craze
 We unknew calling all the banes
 Yesterday's rivers taking me
 To the top of the mysteries
 There I see as the life goes by
 Reason is so fine for me to die

 Steel Says Last!
 Steel Says Last!
 Steel Says Last!
 Steel Says Last!

 Take my hand and be my sister
 Take my hand and be my sister
 I just have to hear your whisper
 Wanted west, but I got eastern
 Northern one is unexistent
 World-ship wrecks but I flow away
 Upon the current of the yesterdays
 As they're out of forgotten springs
 Joined by ocean of tomorrow inDarkness and loneliness enclaved a warrior,
when he was on the way to leave his realm.
To forget what thyey have done to him.
His despair has led him deep into the woods.
Exhausted he crashed at the cold soil.
The pain was huge and broke his proud.
Eternal silence came in,
at day and night.
He could not realize anything,
only the eternal sky.
Shivering cold enclaved him.
No hope, no way was in sight.
Waiting for his death,
in the Realm of eternal loneliness.(Instrumental)By the mysterious rituals
Human souls have to purified
Trees know this
By the trees, by the herbs, by waters
And it will ripe for the harvest

Horned God Of The Celtic Forest
He willed us to leave strife
To unite our knowledges, spells and scrolls
To save the Body Of The Dragon

Wild green fire breaks out over the woods
And druids of Ogma return
Their voices sound over the world

Wave struck on forests from the sky
Our staghorned master
Will return the ancient magic
It will be a song of the woods,
Awakening them

...And this story shall also be toldListen to the screams
That blow on the wind
The sound of the swords
In another world

Gather your forces
Throw back your fear
The days became gloomy
Over our lifes

The moon shines upon the peak
Of the red mountain
The drums resound in the plain
When we attack

Ashes and armour
Encroached upon
Eyes of the land
Regina Montium

With honour we fight on your side
Our mountain queen
The spirit of "Ecce-homo"
Is in our hearts

Symbol of purity
Regina Montium

Follow the wind
That carries the screams
The words of the gods
In another world

The black feeling
Enters your mind
And reaches your soul
On the battlefield

The moon shines upon the peak
Of the red mountain
The drums resound in the plain
When we attack

Ashes and armour
Encroached upon
Eyes of the land
Regina MontiumTwilight, the sun fades, Light glints off our steel blades
Blood will be shed on this day, here..
War, the kings way, Bring about the end of days
Last few weeks a bloody haze, here..


You know that it's wrong, but you fight all the same
And you know death awaits with open arms
You know that he's wrong, you'll die for him all the same
But at least you know the war won't last long


And we watch as the fires touch the sky
And everyone wants him to die
As his walls crumble down, we all hear the cry
Your reasons for war are all lies


Trapped, besieged here, Caught now in this tower of fear
All our deaths draw ever near, now..
Battle, the final fight, Flames rising up in the night
Burning men his final sight, now..

You know that it's wrong, but you fight all the same
And you know death awaits with open arms
You know that he's wrong, you'll die for him all the same
But at least you know the war won't last long


And we watch as the fires touch the sky
And everyone wants him to die
As his walls crumble down we all hear the cry
Your reasons for war are all lies

And we watched as the fires touched the sky
And everyone wanted him to die
As his walls crumbled down we all heard the cry
Your reasons for war were all lies

Listen... (be advised, learn and memorize everything)
This will provide you ton control your destiny
To gain your pride what once was lost

To take the powers of your elders
And destroy every obstacle in your coming path
The journey has just begun...
For the strength and honourCold was a shine
Of a moon's eye far in the skies
Forests, hills and moors
Covered by fog in the Samhain night

Pure midnight silence
Broken by the chants of the Celtic ceremony
Pagan rite has begun 
Torn off a veil of the night's serenity

Women bodies with a spirits of wolves inside them...
Blood is spilled on the wooden altar

Laugh of devilry
Forgotten Dark Ages Of Witchery

Burning the wooden crusifixes
Blaming holy bastard christ
Sacrifice for the obscure forests
Times of the forgotten pagan rites

Worshippers has been slaughtered one by one
Young and old, men and women
They shown no mercy for us
Possessed priests of crucified castrate
And when years has gone and ages had passed
Pagan Cults will be opened again for some ones

Time has come
Master of the woods! Appear on your throne
Your brides
Waiting with a flame in their eyes

Spilling and splashing
Blood of the lamb on the altar
Fullmoon chants
As a hymn for Kernunnos

Forgotten cults of Europe, arising knowledge is murky
Forgotten Dark Ages Of WitcheryLightning clouds gathered on the sky
The earth gave weapon to the stone
A gift was given to man /the fire/
But an ancient element was exploited

The returning fear of sparks firesettings
The scorching hands of lightnings woods
Gave a weapon to the men
A violence fluid and hard
Created to destroy by the earthly

Smiths set fire for hatred
Swords and axes got bloody from the fire's force
The age of metal was to begin
But the element was to rebel
Its growing strenght was the greatest
When the warrior could burn villages
To ashes

The pain felt by men
Was a vindication
Respect of fire was not learned
So it bunished by torturing and burning pain
Nowadays
Earthly beings do know
Unless respecting fire
Day of firewrath shall come
Without sense
Burning all to dust
Cruelly(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Filled with hate and emptiness
Tears fall with bitterness
Dark clouds of clashing emotions give way, I know my time has come...

I'm in the throes of mania
My saddened spirit chokes on despair...
Frozen Tears of my Shattered Spirit
I join the void
Nothing lasts forever...

A passion that is so strong, yet only
A fraction of where we belong, yet always
The torch that guides us along

This is the end, tonight I will end my life
Anguish in me has spawned a desire to die, but I must push on...

Burdened by past and present
Loneliness, I resent
To repress the pain I transcend
My own existence until the end....
The bitter end7. Fields of Anger

No beating heart, within this armour
Only beating for, infernal hate
Today is the say we resist
Bleeding invaser, fields of anger
As commander howls
Archers and warriors
Blacken the sun
With spears and arrows
Magnificent blood rain
Here we go again
To this unfair warfare
What angels can do
Against fury of black legions
Magnificent blood rain
This is unreachable, unavoidable
Winning as a motto
Sights of eternity
In a battle drum melody
Magnificent blood rain
A kingdom against another
No ruling empire
Knocking beasts together
On this fields of angerSo long as the sun does shine
So long as the moon's enthroned
I shall raise my sword to thee

Whispered by the autumn winds
As pure as the winter snow
Your name I shall always hail

In the shade of ancient pines
Chilled by the winds of Samhain Night
My cauldron smolders sage for thee

(Blast-break)

Centuries of raging wars
Reckoned Aryan spirits home
Their spirits are the embers
In the starry night sky
A beacon for Einherjars that stand in line

"Hoof and horn, hoof and horn
All that dies shall be reborn
Corn and grain, corn and grain
All that falls shall rise again"Blood, my blood
Scarlet stream of innocence
Blood, my blood
Wretched sense of indulgence

I bleed for you
I scream for you

Blood, my blood
Scarlet stream of innocence
Blood, my blood
Wretched sense of indulgence

Endure the pain
Grab your  throat, a cataract explodes
Embrace the agony
Crimson glory, splatter from my veins
Endless torment
Excruciating torture of my soul

Clutching at straws
Stand your ground, draw your last breath
Brace yourself
The cause you fight is worth to fight
Curse you all
The dictators, omniscient demagogues

I sacrifice
I bleed

Blood, my blood
Scarlet stream of innocence
Blood, my blood
Wretched sense of indulgence

I bleed for you
I scream for you

I sacrifice
I bleed

Destroy tsunami's power

Poison floats in the sky terror awaits for those who fear
Warriors of the rising sun your orders now are clear
The metal survives the legions align we are one nation
There's one way to live we must destroy this battle will be won

Destroy tsunami's power

Power from profit destroyed all our pride.
All we need is a little understanding for us,
But profiteers take money for our own jobs.

His campaign in the name of revolution,
Is the workshop of beautiful life.
And now os the time that you should understand,
These profiteers are not our kind.

Propaganda materials are money for youtai,
Talking about jews, but you're like a jew
With your job you're backstabbing us
And between us there's no more trust.

Your betrayal and your lousy workshop
You are the rat, we are the true revolution
For every your fault comes our retribution.

You'll be punished from me and my band!!!I wake up and see what we are turning to...
where are the sons of the brave ones?
where is the offspring of this land?

Many of them died fighting against the Usurpers,
the rest of them turned weak and obedient,
their blood has been betrayed
by the memory of their own sons.

But we take our weapons and march to battle.
We, the last of the brave warriors.
We, the summoners of the Ancient Spirit.

No doubt in our minds,
the light in our hearts guides us,
our land is again the battlefield,
this time shall be no mercy.

Few, we stand pride
knowing that our kind is watching us
from above with the dark ravens,
from below in the soil we fight for...Black Metal Machine.

Cold steel, 
Driving pistons, 
Pounding forward 
Into this world, 
Impenetrable mindset, 
Grinding gears, 
Loss of everything 
My final goal.

Spark and Flame, 
Blasting steam, 
Uncontrollable 
Hate Inside, 
A Solid force, 
Crushing presence, 
Rolling over, 
Those of this world. 

Black Metal Machine. 

A glimpse of moonlight on sacred steel, 
The brilliant flash of red death,  
A crimson mist scorches the earth, 
Nature retreats at such a sight, 
The clouds open and flush it away 
The horrible lost from the land,  
Water amplifies the unseen wonders, 
Piercing through what little is know, 
Sweeping over everything, 
In an attempt to rid itself,  
Thoughts and beliefs are flushed away, 
Turned pure, then vanished. 

Try to fight, 
The loss is your, 
Impaled upon, 
One of many spikes, 
Bleeding black, 
Tortured screams, 
Your immortal soul, 
More fuel for the fire. 

Piercing hate, 
Blood lust, 
Pain forged in perfection, 
Destroying, 
Incinerating, 
So many  empty lives 
To add to the flame. 

Black Metal Machine.Deep inside your wicked mind
A spider crawls and weaves its web
Filmy yarns grow into your brain
Surrounded by the hardened rind
The life of constant suffering
And unyielding and dull pain
Words unspoken thoughts forbidden
All is twisted and torn apart

Nothing left and all forgotten
Meaning lost among the lies
Ancient wisdom and old art
All decayed and all rotten

Filthy worms suck your blood
They grow fat but your brain dies
Sooner or later you will drown
In the dirt and stinking mud
Unknown paths will be the same
Guarded by the ancient powers
You will never wear a crown
You won't find the key to truth

Long ago you lost your chance
You failed and made a wrong choice
You don't believe you need a proof
But you know you lost your fight

No one will hear your fading voice
In the silence of the creeping death
Cold and dark is your last night
Breathe deep the fresh air
It is your last breath(Instrumental)The Fields of Tombs
(music and lyrics by Vidar)

Once I took a journey into the dark of mine,
To release the stream of questions "why?"
The thing I learned there was sad, almost made me cry,
Inside the answers, there was emptiness' lullaby

And so it began, the journey without an end,
It became my guide in facts I couldn't comprehend
I couldn't comprehend,
Just couldn't comprehend...

Be welcome my deepest misery,
My challenge to struggle again,
Born on the fields of tombs
with evil I was to regain,
I call the Inferno
I call its rain
I am the Kaos
I am the Pain

My only friend - I suffocate on greed divine,
The war awaits, they've stepped beyond the line,
Won't you be my company, my only alibi,
The light is coming, it is now blinding my eyes

And so went on, the journey without the end,
I've lost my guide in facts I couldn't comprehend...Oh humans! 
 You are the shame of the universe. 
 Oh humans! 
 You tried to touch the God. 

 From the beginning, you been the sickness of the world 
 Your greed, your conceit, your jealousy. 
 Oh die... 

 Eternal fire to your lies. 
 No hell enough for you. 
 So many, bloody nights. 
 So many lethal fights. 

 Eternal death to you. 
 To your race, your kind, your shape, your skin. 
 Cut your tongue. Mute your speech. 
 Oh shut the fuck up. 

 Eternal fire to your lies. 
 No hell enough for you. 
 So many, bloody nights. 
 So many lethal fights.(Instrumental)I'm blackraven
I'm a woodchild
I'm bird of gods
I'm a wild warrior
Spirit of ancestors
Wind in your hair
And I fly to you
I'm darkness
I'm sorrow
I'm a cry
I'm a call
I'm a voice
The voice of old times
Your lost wisdom
And I fly to you
I'm woodchild
I am you
I'm your freedom
I'm your belief
I'm your true way
Way in the darkside
Road in the eternity
And you fly with me(Instrumental)It was predicted, all the signs warned us
But in our great pride we've choosen the ignorance
And now we're dying under the rain of ashes
Cursed be our greed, cursed be the men

This is the fall of Humankind
Oceans appear where mountains were
Poles reversed and snow falling
This is the end of everything

No more culture, no more towns, men release their deep wildness
and in this great disaster the reign of the beasts has begun

Come on! And see by yourself the fall of out greet age, our eternal civilisation

We thought we were immortal like the wind in the sky
We spend our lives to ruin nature as if that life belongs to us

He sits in the oak ground
Uniting three worlds
Earth, Sea and Sky and Worlds beyond

God and World Tree is One
He is huge,
Stretching into the deep skies
And endless marcocosm

His massive trunk is a ridge
Of the Middle World
And a heart of the Ancient Forest

His roots getting deep
Into the secrets of the Earth and Underworld
Sun, Moon and Stars
Circling above Him

Pulsing and flickering Green Darkness everywhere
Bathing in a gold of scintillating fog
The soft moss covers the black, crude, bottomless soil

He wears a crown of the deer horns, Weaved with the ivy,
Burning the green fire

Cernunnos in His Ancient Forest,
In the Holy Temple, the Holy Grove, Cernunnos and his children - Dreams of the Worlds

Horned deity and the Green Man,
Guardian of the Green World.
On the stones, on the rocks,
On the ground - everywhere
Was his faceTalking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today isn't my day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me),
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a dayThousand of years
Splendours destroyed
Empty humanity
Sick earth

The cross forced on all
And all are turned nothing
Chained in  your own world
With the pain and chain and suffering

Our day come...
Hear our voices...
Break your chains...
Free yourself!

We are the warriors of past
Now
Tomorrow
And forever

The cross forced on all
And all are turned nothing
Chained in  your own world
With the pain and chain and suffering

Our day come...
Hear our voices...
Break your chains...
Free yourself!

We will fight for our freedom
We will destroy the cross of the slavery
Destroying your temples
Giving end the decadence

The begin of a new era
We will honor ourself existence
Reborn in the essence
Of a splendours world

Lyrics by Ipse and IpsaRefrain:
"Now we are here, so let rain the beer
We are ready for a drink
Give us the wine, more of the mead
Because we are never to drunk"

Another gathering with all of our friends
Again it's time to celebrate
All the campfires burn in this summer night
Let the old fields sing their old songs
No deast is without us
We replace blood with beer
Drink it out, we have no fear!

Drink, drink it all - drink it all!

Bring me all the bottles
Bring me all the beer
Bring me all the bottles
Bring me all the wine

This is the night we celebrate
All sorrows are forgotten now
This is the night we celebrate
All our friends are here

This is the night we celebrate
All sorrows are forgotten now
This is the night we celebrate
Just feel the magic of this moment

Refrain

See all the people - they're all happy
They're all dancing - listen to Metal
See all the stars - they're all shining
They're all glowing - a new day is coming

RefrainEast winds are blowing
And whispering tales from the seas
Some birds are coming
Bringing the smell of the trees
Holy fights
For their rights
Devil's child
Blessed knights
Darkness mights
Screams behind
Battles in towers
Hard fights rage on the seas
Nobody's caring
What is the spirit of EastI HEAR THEM CLEAR, CALLING...
SUMMONING TOTAL DEATH
THE SIRENS OF WAR ARE SINGING
A SONG WE'LL COMPREHEND...

BOMBS ARE FALLING AND HITTING THE GROUND
AN AIR RAID IN  PROGRESS, IN RAMPAGE'S THE TOWN
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE

ENDLESS TORMENT, BURNING FLAMES
HORRID VISIONS OF ETERNAL PAIN

WE TRY TO SAVE OURSELVES, IN RUINS WE GLIDE
DEAD OR IMPRISONED AS OUR REGION OCCUPIED
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE

ENDLESS TORMENT, BURNING FLAMES
HORRID VISIONS OF ETERNAL PAIN

THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE

A SCENERY OF DESTRUCTION
SILENCE IS BROKEN BY CRIES
A CONVINCING DISPLAY 
OF MILITARY MIGHTUnder the howling wind
Sing me a lullaby.
Life as a chess board.
You can't cross the line...

Around only lust and vulgarity,
Here is no genuine smiles.
A strange similarity of past and future.

And want to fall like a stone,
When inspiration will disappear.
Slaves of our own schemes.
Useful only as a pawns.

My aspirations as a flightless bird
Not fly above the rooftops, but we must to try...
And I look with fear in the insane faces,
And I do not know why still I'm so scared.

And want to fall like a stone,
When inspiration will disappear.
Slaves of our own schemes.
Useful only as a pawns.

So staying alone with you,
I want to hear the lullaby of wind.
When the game is over.
When figures leave the board.You do what gotta do to survive
Like live in Port Townsend all your life
Now, I read Dune and I liked what I saw
But you talk and talk, blah and blah
Waters on the Straits of Juan De Fuca
Made you write Soul Catcher...
Wrote Destination: Void way too soon
'Cuz you still wrote all those shitty sequels to Dune
But at least, David Lynch tried
And two years later, you'd have died!
Frank, Frank, you made me think
Frank you made me
Even his name is a killing word!The growing of life
The change I could feel
The hope for a turning
Not yet to reveal

The power of life
Is within mij reach
Softly awakening
A newborn
Not for me to see

Anxiously waiting
For the big day
Anticipating your coming

Fulfilling our dreams
We try to pretend
Our minds are preset
To a happy end

Life will never be the same
Hope's taken from me
reliving the moment
That came to be

But now there's  a pain
Where my heart used to be
A million blank pages
Are staring
Right back here at me

All I ever had is fading
Like a leaf drawn to the ground
Still I feel my heart is yearning
Since that day

Since that day of hope and dispair
I knew life would never be the same
All the aching all the pain
Come stay with me
Someone please help me
Why don't you stay with me?You crossed the line, I'm feeling
So out of time, I'm reeling
The light dims as another twilight settles on my soul
As shards of ice fall past me, it's so cold
It's so cold


As I'm lost out in the snow, there's no reason
And now I see, out on the ice, no good reason
No good reason to die
No good reason to die


Made my escape, I'm free
And now I'm out, You'll see
My spirit's healed after breaking, now the dark has gone
Make my way back to myself, I'm moving on
Moving on


I was lost out in the snow, had no reason
And now I'm back from on the ice, no good reason
No good reason to die
No good reason to dieWat zullen we drinken, zeven dagen lang

Dus vechten we samen, samen staan we sterk
Dus vechten we samen, niet alleenI saw when the trees grow
so brave they survive
I hear the weep of the rain
when they spill their tears away

The winds whisper in different tones
about the things that I have done
Only hate and bloody war
in the middle of the forest

I live my life for the forest
the green field is my home
Noone can take my freedom away
Feel my blade in the sky!

I'll command with powers of gods
When the ravens fly with you!

From the deep forest we come, we come!
Bringing the souls of the chosen ones
Wisdom, magic, power and light
from the river-girt islands we came
kill, kill them all!
Against the nature's laws
We are ready for the worst

I can feel, I still can feel the winds
Touching our faces...
despite, war, sorrow and pain

I saw when the trees grow
so brave they survive
I hear the weep of the rain
when they spill their tears away

for the trees I'll fight
With powers I protect, in my hand the sword
Every day and night when the first rays are dawning
In thy disorder, turning hate in mighty
My cold light I will hide

Around the fire the sound of death awakes the storm
Inside the forest the darkness reigns
And bring the pain I left behind
The scent of wrath brings a sign of fulfilled prophecy and war

Folowing the will of the gods, revenge in my mind(Instrumental)You are born at a time when evil ruled over the world.
When they shot and gunpowder replace battle eaxe and sword.
In this world of greed, you're left speechless, without words,
But this does not mean we must not forget his blood.

On behalf of all those who have dreamed of your birth,
Arise, brave and fight for the savlation of mother earth
You live in spirit and will of our ancestors proud,
Resolutely stand up, fight and go through a winning sound.

Brother, you had great effect!
Brother, you're not alone!
Brother, nothing else is left!
To make the cornerstone!

Brother, you had great effect!
Brother, you're not alone!
Brother, nothing else is left!
To make the cornerstone!

Now back to the foundation stone of a renewed freedom,
Is the question of the survival of your home.
Final battle with his revatives and crew,
In the hall of heroes create a place for you.

Brother, you had great effect!
Brother, you're not alone!
Brother, nothing else is left!
To make the cornerstone!

Brother, you had great effect!
Brother, you're not alone!
Brother, nothing else is left!
To make the cornerstone!

Arise, brave and fight for the savlation of mother earth

Brother, you're not alone!
Brother, nothing else is left!
To make the cornerstone!(Instrumental)Lost... in the modern world...
I am trapped within...
Claustrophobic nightmares
Plague my mind

A stony wall
Blocks my view
Time and time again
I must break back through

The fear rising with every second
I am away
For how do I know I can return?

Caged, chained, broken
Ripped down into bleeding darkness
I cling to any last hope
That I will once again return homeRoar of wars was covered by the heavy cloak of dust 
Noises of steel reins were broken in echoes 
Air sweetened with blood 
Pagan rabble 
Fallen under the flag of antiquity. 
I like to breath in and I devour greedily 
Each little drop of the times passed away 
Times of blood and of primary love as well. 
In the evening falling into dark I speak to faces in the walls 
They are much older than we are willing to understand 
And also stronger than us, time and the power of oblivion 
They are engraved into walls by songs from universe. 
I like to listen to the narration of the endless labyrinth of horror 
And at the same time I feel the most material and intoxicating power of
times
With which I feel to be bound.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I know my native mystery
My mystery's my fate to fly up
My fate to fly up liberty
My liberty's my ways in sky
Why call me back from Heaven?
I am the raven bird of grief
I am bird of grief the sorrowbringer
Why call me back from Heaven?
Black sorrowbringer misery
I am misery the lament singer
Why call me back from Heaven?
I prayed my Gods to give me wings
Give me wings to learn to fly
There is the Heaven far away
Far away from greed and lies
Why call me back from Heaven?
There is no evil in the sky
In the sky there is no evil
Why call me back from Heaven?
See raven flies up liberty
My liberty is when I'm flying
Why call me back from Heaven?
I flyI used to hate and I still fucking do 
Nothing's changed since last time I saw you 
Chaos, certain pain, no way out, no easy escape 

Fucking rat, fucking snake 
I will spit in your faceI'm starting to feel much anger inside
There's no way to control it
Blood pressure will rise, so demons inside
You don't wanna be next to me

There's no way to stop the adrenaline flow
Running through my veins
I'm out of control, just leave me alone
My anger is to the top

I desire to kill everything that comes near
To fulfill my blood thirst
With fire in my eyes and my heart cold as steel
I will have no mercy

Do not try to scape from this merciless fate
I will not forgive you
And never forget, I'll never regret
You died in my hands

Berserk
You better lock up your doors
Berserk
And close down your windows
Berserk
There's nothing you can do
Berserk
To escape from my rage(Instrumental)He was born when the sun was black
In the time when the infernal forces was one and only
Time before the birth of light
As the beast of world and master of evil
He is the spirit of hate
Now as the time before light
He was the ruler and creator in ages
And he is still our master
We can still hear the anger of the beast
Hate more pure... Than a water of mountain source
In the thousands of years he tried to conquer
The new religion of glory times
He can feel its present weakness
And the upcoming conquer of evil
Defeat is not a word of his world
He is always the master of all creations
Let his destiny fall upon us
And the world is what it once was
The conquer of evil(Instrumental)(Instrumental)AGES: Beyond what human minds expected and deny forever.
TORMENT: Obscene pain I welcome.

THE TORMENT: Thoughtless masses, inhabit the earth in filth.
THE AGES: What luck for the Rulers.
THE TORMENT: Living a life devoid of isolation, entranced by material desires and wishful thinking. Impale me, I've had enough of their ways..

THE TORMENT OF AGES
THE TORMENT OF...

No more living this useless life.. End my existence with your cruelty, eradicate any memory of me, carve the last curse into my rotten corpse.

The torment of ages, The torment of ages, The torment.... Torment...The nocturnal wind blows on the hills
Caressing our hair with it's blessings
The goddess of the forest talks me in
the tongue of Nature and she weeps for me
We will ride our horses to the final battle
As the clouds of the storm gather
to behold our victory
Feel the wicked mist
The fog is crawling and covers
the fields of Alot again
Brothers of the northern land
united to destroy thy legions
An strange empire born behind
our mountains and rivers
Conquerors of the ancient world
But our kingdom will prevail free
Lords and gods of our elders
Druids of the clans, drain your spirit of strenght
The power of our land is eternal
And the brave will acclaim
the honour of Cantabria.(Instrumental)Sondo, eni blino iska kom-mene kom-manos.

Goddess of battle and war,
All of ye watch me. My sword by my side.
Proudly I sit on my horse.

And I wait for the sign in the sky to appear.
telling me that the moment has come
For me to ride beyond the edge of this world
into the realms where the shadows are strong

Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
and take me where you bring all nordsmen slain.

Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain.
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die.

Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand. But the life of a man
was decided long before he was born.

Leaving the plains where my ancestors hunted
for meat and for hides against the cold.
Here the fire was tamed. Here our sword were made.
And here the elders amazing takes told

I ride into land few have seen or returned from
to tell of it's bleakness and dark
I see nothing but mist and the mountains so tall
I can't tell them and the sky apart

Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
and take me where you bring all nordsmen slain.

Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain,

I will not need a heart where I go, should I die.Collector of sins, gatherer of riches 
I hurt those around me to reach my wishes 
Pleading and begging leads only one path 
Filling the ranks of distant shadows crowd 

(Chorus) 
Words that cause wounds and 
scars like the best blade 
Leave no kin alive 
to hold it against ye 
Sleep tight and dream of 
sins, wealth and dead men 
Wards they aren't stronger than the wood they are carved in 

Families buried one by one 
As they're spent on my fields 
I plow them down to the last drop 
Until they're just another shade in shadows crowd 

(Chorus) 

Nights awaken to voices and shouts 
Ever unseen still feels very real 
Old hags runes keep them from getting here 
This growing stirring shadows crowd 

(Chorus) 

Farm boy by the gate post 
Knife in hand and a devilish smile 
Blade cuts into old carved signs and 
A shiver flows through shadows crowd 

(Chorus) 

A rustling in the wind 
Grows by each heartbeat stronger 
Creaking in the floorboards and the 
whole house starts to groan 
All falls still as the candles wink out 
agonizingly waiting for a sound in the night 
Suddenly they're in here with calmly dead stare 
I scream as they shred my soul, bleak shadows crowdI die & I see the abyss of space
                  Killing time flows in river with blood
                     Wrath, valley of fear in my face

                     Now I'm going to astral sleep -
                           to see my petrifying

                              Heaven crying!
                        I want to burn the heavens
                      With ancient fire of eternity
                  I'm dying sovereign of ancient sorcery

                    Fire walk on valles, I swam in it,
                          I swimming to Acheron
                    In this river I die with my wisdom
                   My minds die, Acheron give my wisdom

               Fire impaling the sky, angels die like rats
               Demons wake up, and the black alchemy begins

                        Rotting God fall from sky,
                        and vermins eat his flesh

Alt laa goldI am sure you deserve it  
you were the one, 
who  declared  this war.
I was your loyal friend the only one...

And here i am, in front of you. 
I'll ask you just once. 
Why did you do that shit? 
why you were so unfair? 

No answer ,means no mercy...
I grabed the axe, 
smashed down your head 
to see the blood and brain.

The only thing i need, 
your eyes in my hands to feel. 
And feed them to the dogs,
till the revenge bring peace...

And they show me how to fight the infidelsZie mij omringd door de stralen
De dood trotserend.
De zon is mijn kroon, maar blindheid en sluwheid 
de doornzweep die mij immer kwelt doch ik herrijs.
Breng mij de hoorn van wraak die meedogenloos
zal braken.
Begraaf je handen in het zand, het zwaard zal  zijn
weg vinden
Niemand ontkomt de zwarte dageraad!
Raven vertelden mij dat de zon stierf.
Zal de maan huilen?
Neem nu het wolvenkleed, en in brute extase kleur
de aarde rood.
De bodem voedt zich krachtig.
Aardmuil verslindt ons.
Zij proeft slechts. Graf van mest, ontkiemende zaden.
In naakte puurheid. Huid als bladgoud.
Zijn adem komt met de dageraad van het bestaan.
Ik geloof dat ik de zon zie!I am the dying gasp of the fallen
the last of the flesh chopped from a skeletal frame
blood anointing red the earth
carcass feeding vultures
a vision seen by unseeing eyes
of men hanging from trees
a voice heard by unheeding ears
of men hanging upon crosses
sudden realisation 
stabbing the heart
bringing an end to glorious pain
clutching stomach spilling through fingertips
the beginning of eternal rest
torso without limbs
wisdom of the decapitated
the brave who marched into certain slaughter
pierced by point of spear
the completion of ultimate sacrifice
the fulfilment of men who craved immortality(Instrumental)When the Dusk Comes... (Awakenings of the Demons)
(music and lyrics by Vidar)

Each new dawn I die, with the sunrise I fade away,
Creating the last drop of the sweat on your face,
I am the evil that remains forgotten on the daylight,
To be (en)throned again when the demons awake the night.

Darkness I crave,
Nocturnal slave,
Four-cornered grave,
Cradle of the Pain...

Diving in black I suffocate,
Reading the rhymes of the twilight gates,
The spirit roams in the infinite nothingness,
Into the abyss falls my day, 
Dark waters of Styx wash away,
The dreams that once belonged to emptiness,
You can't escape those dreams of gray,
although with dawn I fade away,
When twilight comes, the wolves hunt for prey,
And when the sun falls I awake,
The Suffering shall last until you break,
Release of malice, the darkest stains...

Come and be my dream,
just a silhouette of hope I see,
On the bed of thorns my body lies,
Awaiting the eternal sleep,
The pain we both did share,
Ment everything to me I swear,
Now without pleasure in the real world,
I shall dive in dreams, right there...

The creator of all the scars in the minds am I,
the real world Satan, hidden in every man,
the mirrors have two faces with the velvet signs of the pain,
Stories they may hide, they are no fairytales...

May I never close my eyes, for the pain the release of long-forgotten
memories brings to me...
The Demons sleep in thee...(Instrumental)Warriors of Teutates drink the mead before the great battle,
the entrails of the sacrificed ones prophesy a bloody fight.
The Sun appeared, dying with blood the arch of Heaven,
Taranis, with a winterstorm had blessed us at Night,
the werewolves of Lug.

Going to the battlefields
they started to knock their shields
with their swords,
the horns made the ground trembles
with great loudness.

Battle cries soon started,
they sang about victory
and about the death on the battlefield,
they sang about the way to the Other Side
when their bodies were devoured
by vultures and ravens.
They sang about their gathering with the Gods,
Werewolves of Lug!(Instrumental)The sun is getting colder in these days 
The light devoured by the night 
And the leaves turning into brown. 
The folk surrounds the land

Deep in my heart, a wolf will break out
Can't keep this beast inside of me
Gathering these moments in a spell 
And bring its wisdom to me

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind, 
In the forest I'm wandering my way. 
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath

Pale are the trees, in the silence a lonely cry
All the faces blurred in the loneliness of tides
Whispering voices come through the thicket
Feel this wisdom inside of me

Deep in my heart, a wolf will break out
Can't keep this beast inside of me
Gathering these moments in a spell
And bring it's wisdom to me

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind, 
In the forest I'm wandering my way. 
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath

I will never leave my path
I will never change my mind
I will never walk alone on my way
I will never stop to fight
I will decide what is right and what is wrong
There are many walking on my way

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind
In the forest I'm wandering my way
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind
In the forest I'm wandering my way
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breathKrystere, pines i evighed

Sons of the soil beneath our feet,
A tribal brotherhood of war
And we know how to die well.

Mighty legions of iron and steel
Dashed to dust by the battles travail
Famished wolves befogged with blood
Our vengeance now, our funeral pyre
Warrior Queen, bursting from hell
Flaming eyes and the God's wrath.

To die as one, free from the lash
In the dark tumult of slaughter.
Terror shrieks of bitter dread 
Druids spitting spells,
Feed the crows on Roman flesh
Ghosts and grinning skulls
Slayers and slain as one in death
In the seething mass of scourging war.

Dream followers and nightmare givers
Through murk and mire we ebb and flow
As vipers we, in the name of Rome
Let it be done

As famished wolves befogged with blood
Gore whetted scythe and pilum hail 
Ravenous dogs, slaughtering haze
Killing blows quelled by groans
Of fallen champion's swords in hand.

We die as one, free from the lash
In the dark tumult of slaughter
Terror shrieks of bitter dread
Slayers and slain as one in death
In the seething mass of scourging war.I see the course of the stars
I know the law of my Gods

When Leon is alive
and Taurus has been killed
I praise thy Mother Rea (for Leon and)
Seasons drive the chariot of the Sun
around the Earth oh, Gods of Cosmos

When light deffuses through dawn and day
Through twilight it fades
Brings night that rules in Hades

When light deffuses through dawn and day
Through twilight it fades
Brings night that rules in Hades

I see the course of the stars
I forsee the dids of mankind

In fiery stars, shining stars
faraway stars as they burn around
celestial sphere

I'm Angaeus, I cast the knowledge
of eather, of Moon, of Gods of Cosmos

I wonder around the global zones

As light deffuses through dawn and day
Through twilight it fadesHigh, this domain up above the soil
On the top of mountains, where Mother Earth pierces the clouds
Between valleys and crests, and across desertic vastness
Through barren plains and fields, onward to the path to a sacred land 

 Thus the nordic winds will guide his march to rise in eternal night
Gods of thunder will strike and bring the flame unleashing his might
Thus the nordic winds will guide his march to rise in eternal night
Gods of thunder will strike and light the fire of the ancient clan 

Ice, this domain overhangs the land
Upon the tops of forests, majestic woods and without end
Amidst the expanses of meadows and arid landscapes
The winter will prevail and dominate by its shroud of frost 

Thus the nordic winds will guide his march to rise in eternal night
Gods of thunder will strike and bring the flame unleashing his might
Thus the nordic winds will guide his march to rise in eternal night
Gods of thunder will strike and light the fire of the ancient clan 

He is the one who knows it all
A strong man dressed in a robe of ice
A burning soul for an idol blessed
He is the one to rule the land and judge the fools
He is the guardian of the sacred mountain, the Wise 

By the power of the ancient words
He owns the magic to strike
Glorious protector of the pagan pride
Bow down before your patriarch tonightRiding to the end of flesh magic final, 
magic death...
Open my eyes to life and death,
back ws the path of the lights.
Sweet tears in earth of wisdom.

I will be teached in the great battle and
equilibrium of the woods. I will ride 
the horse of fire. I will dropped
in the deep dirt ARISE!
In the water I will see the reflect
of life embracing death. Crying the skies,
the earth speak, the seas dance.
I know that my disappearance
will never arrive.
The awaking of conscience will be
revelated to me. No one will survive
from the great battle.
I listen to my learned body
riding to my magic death with no fear.
Dancing with my free spirit,
even find (the path of the light).(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The day is dark but you feel strong and brave inside
The war is on but you don't fear you'll not survive
Others fall in glory's name
With no doubt heart you run onward
Defying death and pain

Blood of warriors soaks the broken wasted land
To the last man fight - You must stand strong - Defend
For the crown and for the king
Spill more blood
While brothers dying - brothers fighting sing

Rise - legions - fight - legions
The swords are drawn - And then you die

You think that you're a hero - Not a brainwashed fool
You think you're something special - I got news for you
Those who died they thought the same
Just another victim on the road to hell
Pawn in the game

Blood of warriors soaks the broken wasted land
To the last man fight - You must stand strong - Defend
For the crown and for the king
Choke on blood
While brothers dying - Brothers fighting sing

Another tear shed - Another soul deadMy time comes
When the night does
genius with his head in clouds
eccentric hunk
obscure weirdo
introverted visionary
Hemp's smouldering over the candle flame
Dark thoughts fill up the room
The bliss of the sensation
Fragments of time make up
A mosaic of the mystic beauty
Perpetuation of the splendid moment
I've mastered the tongue of the Earth
The metallic sound of the voice resounds into infinity
Seemingly insane
I'm just about to conclude my scientific research
Purification of the human spirit
Through prolonged seclusion
The state of mind opens the entrance gate
The time machine has been built
There's just a few tests ahead
Time travel almost drove me insane
If you don't tell anyone
We might set off on
An adventure into the unknownFor at vide hvem vi er

GalningenWhen I was a kid I used to walk up to the height 
And on the hot summer nights just before the storm 
I sometimes glimpsed beyond this world into a place not quite our own 

(Chorus) 
Shimmering lights 
Of marvels and sights 
Beautiful dreams 
From the other side 
Strangely real 
And eerily bright 
The other world dies 
In a halestorm of fire 

A place with lights and strange machines and towers rising tall 
I marveled at these wonders as I dreamt away my youth 
But through the rift I saw one day 
The other world die 

(Chorus) 

I have not gone back to this day as it still scares me pale 
I still don't know if what I saw will come or if it passed 
I pray my children will not think of building towers to the sky 
I pray my children will not think of building towers to the sky 

(Chorus)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The page of New Wave bore Roger's fresh face
Set the taste and the pace for his time and place
In the Courts of Chaos, Corwin struts in Amber
Only those of the True Lineage may walk the pattern
Bloody family feuds and a super-computer in Limbo
A pack of Trumps under the pillow
Worlds of the fantastic. Dense and specific. Unscientific.
New twists on old Myths. Man to Gad metamorphosis
So what his new hits ain't as good or as thick?
It's not his fault Damnation Alley flick sucked shit
My name is Legion. Will leave no doubt. 
Or The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth!A thousand storms have rained upon me
A mere single tear of pain and glory
For a life that has chosen to live
To live that chosen life
A thousand storms have rained in glory
A thousand voices I have heard
We are the heathens
We will never be the mass
And never a herd.(Instrumental)You left so early
I feel bad about all the dirt
Hatred and disregard
But it cannot be redressed
So young and determined
I remember your talent and individuality
I looked up to you without you knowing that
You loved hemp so much
Your stuff was the best
We went separate ways
Our worlds were just one step away from our reunion
Its too late now, you're gone forever
And others want to profit from your death
You have won
And Im sure you feel good
I remember you
And I envy you sometimes
A piece of you is hidden within me
As if your spirit lived though memore than a picture
on every wall
I love your smile
and there is love at all

1, 2, 3 hey I can count
and I can't exclude that
there's no doubt...
no doubt at all

this is not the last conflict
and war is not an answer
this is just another step
another step to our end

another truth on tv
another tour... another show
tell me when you'll come
and when you'll go

bring mye freedom
and democracy
and bombs
godd new bombs

not a drug like alcohol(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I saw you my son
Contemplating our realm
I saw you my son
And I saw your eyes...
Oh father
Oh my king
I know you see what I see
Oh father
Oh my king
I know you feel what I feel...
As this realm you are a son of the complete circle of moon and sun
Of all seasons I'm proud of what I am
I'm proud of who I am
As you my king
And as my ancestors
I'm proud to be this people
And as my people and as my army I am of moonlord and sunwheel warriorTemples they shall burn...
Burn in the night like dying embers 
Lighting the path...
The path to the hate in my heart.

To rid the disease...
Violence essential, show no mercy
Storming with war...
The allfather leads the charge.

We've sought revenge...
For thousands of years we've stalked this nemesis
Like wolves hungry for blood...
To slay the fucking beast of Zion.

The night is on fire...
Their burning temples forming a pattern.
Our souls in the sky...
See a blazing sunwheel belowOp een gitzwarte hengst daar rijdt de dood, dicht en grauw is
zijn masker als lood.
Als bokkenrijders naar de galg marcheren, laat hij zijn ros
ernaast galopperen.

De dood kan ook de trommen slaan, zijn roffel de harten
sneller doet gaan.
Hij trommelt luid, hij trommelt luid! Nu trommelt hij op
een dodenhuid !
Hij trommelt luid, hij trommelt luid!
Hij trommelt op een dodenhuid!

De dood kan ook de trommen slaan, zijn roffel de harten
sneller doet gaan.
Hij trommelt luid, hij trommelt luid! Nu trommelt hij op
een dodenhuid!
Hij trommelt luid, hij trommelt luid!
Hij trommelt op een dodenhuid!

Toen hij zijn eerste roffel sloeg, het bloed van al hun harten
joeg.
En toen de tweede roffel klonk, de rijder in zijn graf
verzonk.
De derde roffel zolang ging, tot hij des duivels zegen ontving.
De derde roffel is traag en klinkt, alsof een moeder haar
kind toezingt.

Limburg in nood! In Limburg rijdt de dood!
In Limburg rijdt de dood! Lalalala, lalalala.
Limburg in Here in this land of snow and ice, where the child of the mountain always cries
With the strength of a wolf but twice that size, Running trough the powder with pride in it's eyes
Storming trough the broken ruins covert with the crystal sand
History is telling stories about men who crossed his land
Everyone who tried to claim him with the purpose to be grand
has been buried in the garden where the black carved tombstone stands

open your mind, open your eyes. when you breathe trough the fog of lies
when you're awake, when you're asleep. you must hide the burden that you keep
When you march trough the land of the beast. beware of the frozen path beneath your feet
The journey in this blizzard is relentless and long. In the mist sounds the call of the snow-lion-song

Here in this land of the frozen trees. Where the wrath of the forest never sleeps
With the power of a god and harder than steel. Raging trough the undergrowth when death reveals
Defeated by your own reflection in the mirror of the folk.
Looking in the eyes of the lion standing like a frozen oak
Tears and sweat will gather forces and the blood will block your throat
Men will read the words on your tombstone of the saga that you wrote

Man and beast, fighting together. in the night of the ice-cold weather
who is the monster, who is the man. the monster is he who destroys our land
your sword is sharp and it's steel is strong. you may have the bravery but don't be wrong
at the end of the day you will die alone. When you hear the roar of the snow-lion-song

The lion may die but his feet in the snow will never fade away
even now when the snow is falling
on a winter night, you can hear his song

When you walk away
close your eyes
'cause in life you don't need faith
trust is the key for every man
By the lion, you will be saved.
By the lion, you will be saved.(Instrumental)A sad day my birth
Shining, however.
Like all of us, I came
From myriad of stars
Vision obscured by a foolish modern life
Full of contradictions, plenty of cruel ties
Misery and ruin, human heritages
Poetic decadence in a digital process

As a good citizen there are things that you should know
And things that you should not
Unnecessary time, incomprehensible logic
To confirm our distance from the "myths"

But I won't be mistaken, or forget my name
My augury is the full moon
An orphan to this world, but many parents I have
I was born in the rise of Luna

And the universe conspires
To the balance between dark and light
Our perfect exile
Does not exist there's no fault
It's just you and meMy warrior spirit kneels with faith
When I hear the mighty roars in the sky
Candlelights die out as the wind blows strong

The smell of thunderstorm drives me in trance
As my soul awakes to the folk-consciousness of Asgard
And the wind blows stronger

Rain falls heavily from above
And I awake from my day dream
I'm amazed by the strength of the storm
As I see flashes hammering the ground

And beyond the grey mantle of the sky
Thor, in his journey, strengthens my will
And reminds me of my duties towards
My folk and my ancestors

Fearless Thor! Endow me with courage
Stand above me and aid me in my fight
I promise you that I won't know fear
Nor, cowardice

Storm's essence possesses my heart
And I absorb this energy
I feel it in my blood; I feel it in my flesh
This new strength gives me the power
To draw in the well of my ancestor's might
The force to win!

I'm now ready to wage the war!Visionary slave

Our fury hails the storm 
Glory awaits us in the hall 
Standing strong, we shall swarm 

When the black birds take to the sky 
We will shout a victorious cry 

Our time has come 

Death may come when we hear the drums 
We bravely fought now we hear the song

The night began and full moon is to see
The wind he blows us in this fight

It has begun to raining and to thunders
Lightning's are to be seen in the sky

Withdrew themselves behind the city wall
But these will not be able to withstand us
Because we built up this walls sometime

Yes, now the instant finally is came
Our fate will fulfil itself on this day
I can smell the fear of our enemies
But nobody can save them - no more

I stretch my hand into the air
And keep firmly clasped my sword
Now I instruct the attack on the city
And a powerful storm begins to blow

The night in gales and full moon is to see
The storm he carries us in this night
Our flags we holding in the hands
The coat of arms is liberty

Thousands of stones fly against the walls
Against the mighty walls of Ruhn town
Arrows and Spears hit the enemies
I can smell blood and fear

The horses trample with the hooves
Everywhere you can hear the cries of death
But we do not know pity today
Because this will be our last battle

The combat capability of the clan is destroyed
They cannot resistance us any longer
But we do not let any of them flee
Today they will die by our hands

Some of our mans catched Illnar the traitor
The traitor of my son and the land
I instruct to burn him before the city
And he should not get a sword

[Bridge:]
I run to the middle of the city
To the old fields now Uziels palace
There our soldiers had catched him
Now we will fight man against man

Uziel prays for his life
I strike with my fist in his bloody face
And instructs him to stand up
Now fIt's almost non existent, the sympathy i have for man
The things that come to your mind are only materialistic
Tangible distractions that keep you amused fro some time
You judge other people before you look in on yourself

And as the sun fades and nightfall is reborn
You will be nothing more than a memory
Your impact on this earth is nonexistent
And only time will erase your remains

I climb the concrete structure you call home
I stalk the shadows and enter your safe haven
I stand over you, filled with hatred and disgust
Your soft breathing makes me laugh and you awaken

You are so fucking pathetic and i can no longer just observe
All your greed and lies must be forgotten
You don't even take the time to see the shit you are

You see the gleam of a cold knife
The tear in your eye reflects my anguish
I take this knife and open your neck
You try to retaliate but it is no use

Your blood begins to run and hope is lost
Your grasp around my neck slowly loosens
And i know you have submitted
It is amusing to see

I return to the place i call home and gaze 
At the twinkling night sky
The moon reflects the austere trees, and the whispering 
Wind is a peaceful atmosphere
As calm as ever, I drift to sleep

Karmageddon- Guitars, Drums Lyrics and Vocals
Hrodvitnisson- Bass and Vocals(Instrumental)Surrounded by endless darkness
I'm crossing the country
I'm feeling the anger of the wind
It's coming closer with all it's
Hate and it's strenght it is resolving
War against Christ's
We've been sent to take revenge
For our pride and our honor
The only thing that has remaind
In the country was the anger of the windLet madness hunt my mind
Let violence guide my hand
Embrace this insanity of mine
Release the demons trapped inside
Arson, murder, suffering
Raping, pillaging, butchering
Cravings are haunting me
My soul will feast on your despair

A vengeful state of mind
Evil incarnate in the flesh
Infested mindset plagued with scorn
Will make sure you are laid to rest
Oppressing, usurping, torturing
Extorting, infesting, pestering
Never turn the other cheek
Retaliate with tenfold strength

Desolated 
Desecrated
Diabolic
Dystocratic


'A democratic society can never be a Satanic society. A dystocratic society is a Satanic society.'Carved the body into small parts
Hashed the divided shreds inside your minching machine
Rotten taste of kreatoxin
No apperant hunger to devour it
As she's waiting for microwaving
In her fester aroma owen it's fried her reeking dinner
Roasted flesh is ground by your teeth
Now it's time for perparing the genital meat
Reeking fester mealIn silence I stand alone
The creed of iron emerging
I walk in a circle to the north
East, south and west
With the hallowing hammer held high
I recite ancient works
My mind consecrates, sign of the hammer forms
Banishing all influences unholy and impure
My will to the just service of Wotan
Ancient god of my people

I light the sacred fires, hear thee this day
I pay tribute to you, and the high ones
Of the Aesir and the Vanir
Let knowledge of our blood be clearly known
Fire of cleaning, and creation
Embraced by the eternal mysteries
Through thy symbols eternal

I summon thee now
Wisdom and counsel I seek
My ancestors gather around me
My ceremonial drum beats stronger
The evergreen spring I touch
I receive blessings from Thor
Randomly runes appear to guide and protect
Hail the Norns, I feel the blessing of Frigga

I give honour to my fathers and mothers
I hail my brothers and sisters
I embrace my sons and daughters
Drinking from the horn of strength
My sword held high to the sky
I give honour to thee not as many but as one
United in a kindred spirit of our folkThis is the Hellath
We'll not fall
We'll not die
Your blade is weak
And our flesh strong
Hellpath - hunts your soul
Hellpath - bleeds you dry
You can't make us fall
You can't kill us
Venom spreads in vein
The snakebite is deadly
Possessed - towards the dawn of man
The riders of chaos, we are
Heavenly poison - feeds your weakness
The robe around our neck, we are
Seeking the storm, Seeking the war
Seeking chaos, Seeking your death
Walking towards the light, we stop you!
Going straight to hell with us
Even in afterlife we hunt you
A one way path to hell?!Frightening creatures to appear in the sky
horrifying voices resounding through the night
gaping wounds covering their bodies
wolfish howling introducing their terrible ride

Attacking in stormy winter's night
frenzy demonic warriors undead
brought back again to live
by runic initiation, necromantical rites

Led by the one, stirer of strife
furious raging through cloudy skies
guarding the living and guarding the dead
restless hunter in darkened times

Bare bones shining in gloomy night
where men fell dead by wolfish fangs
the hooves of skeletal horses rtide
the dead men to carry aside

...and the chase has just begun!

Insane bloodlust and predatory strength
raging berzerkers on sinister ride
insensitive to pain, no mercy they know
the host of the dead winter's tide(Instrumental)Master from beyond and of firm ground
Caress the wind and waves converse
with the beast.
In the name of the Druid.

You give energy to the arm
of the warriors, you evade yourself
in the bottomless forest,
meditate on the top of
the ancient stone, whisper to the trees.
In the name of the Druid.

Shout to the great thunder, the flash
of the ray reflects himself
in learned eyes. Lord of the hidden world
and of mystic arts, you possess the wisdom
of the immortal cult.
Ground, water and blood
in your hands. Fire in your head, 
wind in your breath,
liquid crystal in your heart.
In the name of the Druid.Is the heavens' height high?
Is the rivers' depth deep?
Do not think of lot, soothsayer
If the time picked up its speed

Night will be changed into day
And again the Sun
Will make its trip in the sky

I will praise you, God of forged fire
Without cursing my own destiny

No more former days and previous roads
Can't return to the past without step over it
To extol all the past is just vicious habit
That subsists in the epitaph's words

I feel your power,
Barrows of ancient land
This power keeps me
Stand on my feet

I am calling you,
Spirits of barrows,
To became a grain
In the vortex of timesRoep uit de zwarte diepte. Kloof van onleven.
De weerbarstige vulva waar geen zaad meer kiemt.
Storthoop van zielen.
De braakliggende schoot van de perverse nageboorte.
Zij hoedt het rot in de aarde in de schaduwzijde van de cyclus.

De ziener wroet in de aarde. Hagal Hagal! Runen in
bloed op een vuil altaar.
Speer in zijde, oog in bron. Luisterend naar de
wijsheden. De wijsheden die de wind zingt.

De noodlottige oncreatie zal hij vinden in haar
grijs-bruine wereld aldaar.In fallen leaves, in drops of rain
In smoke of fire I see her face
Deep in the forest, forces of nature
Whispers of winds shouting her name
Forever goddess - lady in grey
With Autumn Goddess they've started their dance

The night is sleepless
The moon has risen
Cry with me in the sleepless night
The Autumn Goddess

Dance with me in the moonlight
The Autumn Goddess
Another step
Come to me now
In my grey soul
You'll loose your mind

Her tragic kingdom comes from the wildness
And secrets hidden in mystic smile
All fallen creatures obey her highness
The majesty of sadness and lie
Voices of pleasure resound in silence
In endless night when stars don't shine
Mysterious slaves adore her violence
In gravy dance with screams and cries

Grey are her eyes
Grey are her breasts
Grey are her lips
Grey are her hips
From circle of colours I want to escape
Grey is her smile
Grey are her cries
Grey is her dance
Grey are her senses
With all of my heart I want to be greyEvil makes us hypnotized
 In my world is it my life
 You saw me burnt and you can feel it
 All I know that evil lies
 World is what we want to be
 That's the same all history
 Forever lost and you can touch me
 All I know that evil wins

 Evil! Evil?
 In my world is it my life

 World is what we want to be
 That's the same old history
 All was a dream all was unreal
 Real world we'll never see
 Evil makes us hypnotized
 Someone's crying on my side
 You've got this law and you can touch him
 All I know that evil lies

 Evil! Evil?
 In my world is it my life
 If you think I'm a liar you could be right
 I don't know, I don't care and I won't realize
 I'm a doors of the house of illusions
 If you wanna know why then you're gonna just dive
 Into the depths of your inner streams
 Into kingdom that never have been
 Everyone's just a slave of illusions
 If you wanna know  why then you're gonna just dive

 Evil makes us hypnotized
 Someone's crying on my side
 Forever lost and you can touch me
 All I know that evil lies
 World is what we want to be
 That's the same old history
 Forever lost and you can feel it
 All I know that evil wins

 Evil! Evil?
 In my world is it my lifeFar above the sea, covered with the snow
In a twilight of a big nation, stands the frozen throne
Now World has changed, after the greatest war
Nation has been looted, and exists no more

After decade of glory, comes the day to fall
After coming dusk, there will be no dawn
See their axes broken, see their ruined homes
They have lost the battle, and they are food for worms(Instrumental)(Instrumental)It's silent and the ocean can tell
As no wind blows over it's surface
Something strange and rare is happening
Such silentness has never been felt
It's like the time stands still
And never have such earthly life forms
Felt such fear and thought so much
It's like the last thought of human race

And seconds after the nature
Gives it's sign of life and existance
But for the humans a certain death
The earth's surface quivers
And the water begins to stir
Winds of a strength which no man
Has ever believed existed
Waves high flows towards land
Thunder rumbles in the sky
While lightning strikes all over
From the centre of earth
Do enormous chinks open
And what's left of the human world
Falls down into the depths of darkness
While mountains high melts
And cover the last evidence of this age's flowers

After this everything is quiet
Only the cool breeze is left
To blow away the smoke
From the wasted landscapes
Everything of this age is buried
And becomes a secret that will never be known
It was malice and the only solutionI had vision from nowhere
 I saw the dragon's flight
 I was the crying willow when
 White magpie was my bride
 Now I am sitting on the throne
 Incrusted with the flames
 There is no doubt I shall re-born
 But flesh will stay the same

 The crooked fingers draw the line
 Inside my inner space
 The ancient spirits touch my mind
 Through burnt skin of my face
 I see immortals by my side
 For aeon now I lust
 The mystery will be my sign
 My past life is a dust

 Now I feel my disappearing pain
 All I've felt my past life was in vain
 Now I know the fire is the main
 I know I know my name

 Soul is the fire!
 I know my soul is the fire!

 I am the alien form of life
 For those who lived before
 There are no birds in skies of mine
 I only dare to soar
 No one will reach me at the top
 Because the stones melt here
 The lightning is to be my sword
 The clouds shall be my steels

 Now I feel my disappearing pain
 All I've felt my past life was in vain
 Now I know the fire is the main
 I know I know my nameOver the seas far and wide
Our ship sails and the dragon shall glide
These oars will batter the seas
Scum of the waves for our adversaries

In search of wealth we abide
In search of death with all honour and pride
Cold winds and rain we endure
As we submit to an incessant lure

Tough men with their callous hands
Skilled by tradition of perseverance
To weather gods that we pray
Masters of alien shores we will slay

Regal and clerical sacrifice:
Slaughtered for Odin, they shivered like flies
Chieftain: What fate might befall
The blood eagle rite is the cruelest of all

Fear bloody wings
Fear bloody wings, our glory, your gore
Fear bloody wings
Your spirit flies forth, while your wreckage stinks

Fear bloody wings
Fear bloody wings, as long as we're free
Fear bloody wings
Between birth and death, it's the longship and sea

From mountains dragons have fled
Nearly extinct but the Nordic king said:
Re-instate their lost, forlorn reign
As we witness the Roman Empire wane
Strayed from its glorious past
Decline is theirs, but the Vikings will last:

Varangians Eastlands shall see
Normans established in Normandy
To Byzantine like the flood
Axes of Rus tasted Bosporian blood

Oh, how we conquered the waves
Women as whores, and many as slaves
Living in hardship, piss on the meek
Glory in death the redemption we seek

Fear bloody wings
Fear bloody wings, our glory, your gore
Fear bloody wings
Your spirit flies forth, while your wreckage stinks

Fear bloody wings
Fear bloody wings, as long as we're free
Fear bloody wings
Between birth and death, it's the longship and sea.Rejection of the forest path 
Far along the broken way 
Funereal procession 
Dappled in light and shade 

Adorned from head to toe 
A full body mask of deceit 
Drenched in the musk of ages 
Disgust will not escape from this scene 

Unholy rites enacted 
With each waking breath 
Voluntary extinction 
Earth on fire 

Drowning in a cesspool 
Of things and greed 
Nations are gripped 
By imagined needs 
Vile denunciators amass 
Wild natures suppressed 

Heathens within the burgeoning flock 
Denounce hypocrisy 
From the altars rise 
Cry blasphemy 
From the decadent heights 
Raised fists when the times not right 
Give credence to those that deny 
Within the ranks our worst enemies arise 
Revolution not fast enough for us to survive 

Our gift is our curse	
From birth we learn to abuse 
Consume the final moment 
Of doom 

War against all 
Rages on evermore 
No forgiveness 
No remorse 

Power to create 
Right to destroy 
Elaborated ethics 
Final thought 

We give thanks for the lives we had 
And mourn the coming of the end 
The endI see the world through your eyes
Still innocent
And I feel the old pain that comes from
The wounds of time
(The wounds of time)

You often extend the hand for help
Finding indifference
Or maybe you haven't been able to grab it
At the right time
(At the right time)

Who am I? Where am I?
You screamed at the sky
Why am I here? In this constant fear
Nothing is more clear

So hide the tears and heal my ills
Ah, rain from the universe
Erase the sins and put out the fire
Ah, that burns my skin
Rain from the universe
So hide the tears and heal my ills
Now quench my thirst again

Lying on the bed in the moonlight
Breathing slowly
You hear the echoes of the past
Back in your mind
(Back in your mind)

Who am I? Where am I?
I screamed at the sky
Why am I here? In this constant fear
I will disappear

So hide the tears and heal my ills
Ah, rain from the universe
Erase the sins and put out the fire
Ah, that burns my skin
Rain from the universe
So hide the tears and heal my ills
Now quench my thirst again

And still those whispers fill my head
Still those questions haunt my dreams
Still I'm waiting for that rain
But still I'm speaking to myself(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Can you hear the horns? Sounding from the depths
Can you see the sun? Burning its black Beams
The end is near, ocean's rising
Night is approaching, Mankind is dying!

Life is just a cycle, everything revolve
Death is not the end, all will rise again

The waves flood through the earth, fire burns lakes and forests
Smoke of the life fill the air, no one can escape the final day

I feel the strength leaving my body
I feel my soul rising in the air

Life is just a cycle, everything revolve
Death is not the end, all will rise again

Rebirth! I feel the blood through my veins, flowing again
Rebirth! I feel the air through my lungs, filling again

All around me is just ruins and chaos, but I an alive!

The waves flood through the earth, fire burns lakes and forests
Smoke of the life fill the air, no one can escape the final day
Shadows cover the earth, the eternal night has begun
But far in the horizon I can now see the dawn of hopeMy name is not important 'though I think you might have heard 
I taste the beer of mortals and I drink with them indoors 
The pacts and talk of men who drink beneath the Heron's gaze 
Feed me with their maegen and their otherworldly glaze 

And men say 'Hey you, give me some more mead!' 
And bang the tables in the Drinking Hall. 
Ale is drunk in joyous songs the Sons of Woden meet 
At tables they sit spinning, quaffing ale and meat 
Tales of metal, rock and stone, of times of then and now 
They realise their journeys have led to common paths

of the common folk!!Rushing through the sky, hunting the horizon, hunting towards the end
The eyes of a man suffers the rage of our infinite master
Power and passion, hate and sins, raise your fires from the abyss within

Fire sweeping the earth, ruining the soil, as the rage strikes upon you
Fire, bleeding fire, smoke burying breathing living remains, covering your remains

Spirits from below rushing from the caves, setting fire to the sky
Turning ancient wisdom against the earth
Satan opening the gates, embrace the fires towards your skin

Rushing through the sky, hunting the horizon, hunting towards the end
The eyes of a man suffers the rage of our infinite master
Power and passion, hate and sins, raise your fires from the abyss within

Glory, spitting fire, never again
Raging Antichrist burning the earth - fire!

Fire sweeping the earth, cracking the soil, as the rages strikes upon you
Fire, bleeding fire, smoke burning breathing living remains, covering your remains

Enter the gates, see the force arising

Rushing through the sky, hunting the horizon, hunting towards the end
The eyes of a man suffers the rage of our infinite master
Power and passion, hate and sins, raise your fires from the abyss within(Instrumental)Time has come
 Dreams turn to reality
 Glance to the future
 Skies are amalgamatin' 
 With the earth
 Eternal oppositions
 Light and darkness
 Neverending battle is goin' on
 
 Trails of offence
 Washed off by blood
 Scars will remain
 
 Where' is you - respond to me
 Approach and confide
 Reveal secrets - burn the lies
 
 So hurry up
 Towards new day
 I'll guide you to thither
 Where time has died away
 
 Before dawn
 You'll see a starshine
 Follow for it
 And you will come
 
 To the gates
 Of defeated prospects
 Pain & fear
 Forever gone
 
 Cast away the chains
 Desired freedom
 When all will be done
 Last words will be said
 Know that I will find you
 And together
 We will go away 
 By hand in hand[I A Fire Burns In Readiment In The Solemn Hall]

[II A Chant To Woden]

[III The Voices Of Battle Are Summoned - It Is Time To Push Forward...]Now the sun has set and the moon has risen
from her illuster crypt, hear my dark voice
calling over the twilight fields of war...

As the dark winds wander over my woods, the
grey skies are opening their light for this
ceremony, it gives me the power for a new
kingdom, mine... it bring the return of
the ancient ones nearer... together, we''ll
reign further and further... Into eternity
...I''m (almost) immortal

I still wander,
And dreams are often forgotten
But this nightmare continues and
Paganism won''t be restored but we''ll blow
Christ up into his right dimensions,
Longing for darker days

Visions of a past, rejected thoughts
a shredded dream: christ still rules this
world, but his kingdom''s drowning, still I''m
longing for those darker days

Our day will come once... it''s even closer
than you can imagine

Into the sinister paths we follow(Instrumental)Visions through the mirror bring me alteration of perceptions
As the lunar conjunction darkens the astral light
AND I ACCES
TO THE UNKNOWN DEPTHS
Violet blazes explode before my eyes (before my eyes)
Through black emotions I complete my rebirth
I, creator of myself - I have travelled to the gate

An infinite corridor winds as a sinuous serpent
Who brings astral energies
TOWARDS THE EMPIRE OF DOOM

A voice from the abyss:
"Cursed be thee, for thou dared
TO PASS THROUGH THIS GATE!"

I ascend to a higher level
May Wisdom
Bless my path.The path you tread is desolate
How can you be so happy and content
While I have to struggle so much
Unbelievable, this hollow parody of a man
Who used to be my friend
People like you never know their distance
Can't you have fun without the filth
You force on me all the time
Im not gonna share this psychotic drama
Of dismal ambivalence with you
Its too late and you know it
You will never get your life under control again
All the values went down the drain
You're laughing at your own impotence
You've defiled the purity of our friendship
And the road back is blocked
By deposits of self-delusion
Evolution's been passing you by
As time goes by
Only a handful of memories remains
And no more adventures for you
Im soaring too high to swoop
If I did I might miss out on something
That makes a difference
Something I'd hate to loseReaper... rape the cosmic creation
And bind an declaration.
Feel the great storm which fulfils the air.
And sacrifice all fear.

In the greatest kingdom of my inner self
I summon thee, ave Satanas
In the greatest darkness of my inner strength
I call upon, regie Satanae.
In the greatest wilt of my inner being
Shemhamforash
Hail Satan.

The darkness beyond turns into one
So let it be done
Show me the mystery
To my unsolved fantasy

Lend me the power of chaos
And let it shine upon us
Greeter of madness. Follower of darkness.
Darkness!!!
I come upon, for as I am your son
Give me the key, and I shall never flee.
But give thee an eternity.

Inquam fusus letalis ira
Furor et letum longe lateque.
Potens nocens eruo quam.

As I stand in the dragon circle,
And are embraced by the wings of chaos.
I see my self like the flame.
Ave Satanas, reige Satanae,
Shemhamforash, hail Satan!!!

For as I am the light of northern darkness
I am the supreme art of the burning essence
I am the mystic beyond
I am under the wings
I am under the wings of SatanStanding at the prow of my dragon ship its the dawn of a day
A day we sail south to a foreign land and I'm leading the way
Silently carving through the sea we raise up our oars
The wind in our sails will guide us to these foreign shores

Our lookout sights a monastery on the shores up ahead
Surrounded by Christian monks who'll soon be dead
Pagan warriors jumping into shallow sea
Charging up the barren beach all following me

Monks screaming all around
Their monastery burning to the ground
As we drowned their bodies in the sea so grey
Where was their god this day

The expression of pain on a monks face as i plunge in my sword
In his final desperate he cries for his lord
Their home now burns around them in the dusk of the day
Their land now plundered and bloodied as we sail away

Monks screaming all around
Their monastery burning to the ground
As we drowned their bodies in the sea so grey
Where was their god this dayA somber funeral - cold rain's falling down, when the coffin is thrown into the ground.
Around the grave stand the deceased's friends, while drunk priest screams out of unholiness.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.
Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.

Jesus has wept upon his cross, while Satan mocks God, the "Big Boss".
A vampire rises up from his grace, summoned forth by a drunk priests' unholiness.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.
Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.

The cross has just broken, Jesus is dead, my sword hacks down unto my enemies' head.
The pope has died and the Vatican burnt down, Jesus will never wear his golden crown.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.
Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.

The battle has ended, a life in peace begins.
The Christians are punished for their bad sins.
Punished by true evil and tortured with pain, in Hell where Dark Lord forever reigns'.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.
Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death. Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.Smoke curtain in these eyes
Your heart so far away
Now I can't see your smile
Your love just killed me

I've lost my time
Reality has stolen my dreams
Where is the happiness?
Maybe inside your soul

There are only broken hopes
There's only pain here
Slave to your memory
I'm still waiting for you

I've lost my time
Reality has stolen my dreams
Where is the happiness?
Maybe inside your soul

Maybe inside your soulGoat dead wolf
Prince black dog
From the sulphur battlefields

For I am one with the master
I he master within

Grant me my crown of horns so that the wings may grow out

I promise death unclean
My demons unleashed upon you
Gonna kneel before you die
Every home a slaughterhouseThrough the frozen and misty woods
In this dark place where I was born
From eternal majestic forests
Upon the throne of our realm

Through the summits of our mountains
And the expanses of our plains
From the icy peaks of our crests
Upon the throne of our kingdom

By the splendour of North my brave soul is spellbound

Beyond the tops of the snow covered mountains are stars twinkling bright
As burning suns in the night they stare at the darkened earth
And for thousand years, nature prevailed in serenity, frost and storms
For the purest quintessence of heathen spirit dwells in these lands

Chanting these words to the glory of our world
To make one with the Earth until the end of times(Instrumental)Far in deep winter nights
In cold plains

None know why

so fathomless vast and old, an unmutable voice
the uncrowned king of ancient gods

The growing structure of purest power
reaching far beyond our spiritual abyss
the guardian of all crawlings beings
a shining monilith in the witless days

In my oaken chest i fell it pound
with the thunderous sound of raging storms
In my oaken chest i fell it thrive
on the blooming ruins of mine

In it`s shadow the age of aesirs was born
nourished with the nectar of counsciousness
the shore of a pitch-black stream
spreads among it`s neverending roots

In my oaken chest i fell it pound
with the thunderous sound of raging storms
In my oaken chest i fell it thrive
on the blooming ruins of my figthVirtues of a viper, darkness in soul
Grief, dirty impulses and horrid pain
So afraid of dawn, you in frozen dark
I utter the eclipse of divine
Stiria, I embrace you dead
Stiria, I immolate the innocence
Stiria, I embrace you dead
Stiria, I immolate the innocence
In torment I cry for the unholy
Profane this poem shall be, a denial.Sacred Power of Blood and Proud

Song of ages carries loud
Fires burn in boundless forests
Gales blow resonantly
Like our forefathers did before
In difficulty of hard wrok
Blood on battlefield
Sweat on plow teared soil
Stars wane near dawn
Summers and winters go by
Uplifting living
Hail and Glory
Hail to proudes and bravest
We will always be firmly
With heart full of faith
With soul divine power 
With triumpf of the Will a
nd strenght to struggle
Ennoblest Folk
Tough and joyful
Persistent in fight, full of zeal
From Gods Order adhered to landBehold! Again I'm trampling eviscerated bodies,
My hands are washed in blood and I enjoy the sight
Of mutilated children heaped beneath slaughtered warriors.
I bathe in blood! My soldiers raped all the women and 
I'm insane with pleasure listening to their desperate wailing; 
knowing that they'd be massacred, and then I'll sodomize them all...

We left the town devastated; survivors shivering in terror,
 The flames of grief flickering behind my soldiers.

                                 Anno 734, Month 6, Day 24. ,
                                 From diary of unknown troops leader.(Instrumental)Flaming forests, set on fire
Dreaming mind will fall, lost,
Hidden in this cruel cold cave
Under eternal rule of frost

Above our surface they bleed under the noon sun
Prisoner forever, burning flesh cursed by no one
Shadow of the grave, being once under the noon sun
Entrapped in narrow cave, wild mind cursed by no one

History saw him hunting beasts
Deep in wild forests of countryside
Escaped from the known world
Searching the knowledge and then something died

Malice and cruel thoughts
Finding wisdom of ancient times
Natural powers returned to him
All-killing wrath under the ground

Struggled mind, closed into stone
Soon will be blind though he'll see
There can be found a mirror of the soul
The crash can revive life, and the dead can feel

Flaming forests, screaming beast
Guilt of the one has set them on fire
Flaming forest, earthly breast
Terrestrial fate, done and deceased

Beware the nature's wrath
Pray for the cautious signRelevant words spoken backed up with historical actions
Expand depth of soul and degree of consciousness
No longer bound in shadows, stand in brilliant light
To expose the tyrants lies to unseeing eyes

Ancient memories speak to to the folk
Primitive instincts begin evolution
Evocations of inspiration and life
Against tyrants tools of suppression.

Increase vital energies through experience of nature
For the development of strength and character
Create culture for progress of our folk
To counter the tyrants message of lethargy and sickness

Live for the next personal transformation
Celebrate achievements great and small
Confirm our existence by uniting in pride
Cast aside the shackles of guilt

Remember the souls of our fathers,
Seek the wisdom of our blood,
This is the dawn of reality, avoided for too long.
The illusions are broken, certain fate is revealed.

When our beliefs are what we do
When no one knows compromise
And time is no longer wasted
Then we have won.As they command, they force you yo obey
Sucking all strength that is left away
No power left to resist another day
Another victim of everyday's routine

Well here I am, When someone calls my name
After all, I'll do anything you say
Well here I am, though inside my pride remains
A small glimpse of light that'll never fade

Unlock and release what's left of courage inside
Tell them your thoughts, don't hold back this time
Convince yourself, then fulfill your aim
Your righteous place that is yours to claim

Well here I am, when someone calls my name
After all, I'll do anything you say
Well here I am, though inside my pride remains
A small glimpse of light that'll never fade


And as I look back to all these oppressed years
I still feel the suffering and see their tears
An entire nation had lost their hope and pride
"Raise your fist there's no more time to lose!"

Now is the time to leave our pst behind
Well stand up and fight for all that's worth!
Fight!!

Well here I am, when someone calls me by my name
'Cause after all, I'll do anything you say

In the slaughter that followed, many brave men died for the cause of justice
Against the opressors that tiranized the land
In the end neither side had won
Many lives were shed under a bloodred sun
And as the moon rose over thousands of corpses
It was said this battle was lost even before it beganFury of the gods
Becoming a storm
They think our end approaches
But they are wrong

In a massive way
The enemies come
But we all are strong
Our arms are like stone


The sun goes down and the moon is hidden
behind the dust made by our soldiers
Walls are stained because of blood spatters
We shout in rage but pain makes them cry louder

This is our most glorious night!
Enemy hordes have fallen!
All of those who have arrived
Will be decimated by our axes!


And tonight we will feast and drink blood
in handmade cups carved out in your skulls
Your corpses will feed the fire to cook our food
And then we will dance around you!


And tonight we will feast, and drink blood

This is our most glorious night!

All of those who have arrived

In tiefen Hoehlen schlafen alte Goetter,
doch noch immer erkennen die Baeume ihren Herrn.

Und es sind die Floeten des Pan
die das alte Lied erklingen lassen.

Im Zwiellicht in den Waeldern
tanzen die Blaetter zur Melodie des Biegengottes
und fluestern seinen Namen in den Wind.

Der Eichbaum trauemt von einem Gott mit Hoernern
und weiss von keinem anderen Koenig.In the past and in the mind
a passage exists
Bridge of death,the gate of black age
where plage was the king of mankind
On the liar throne
lord chaos pointed has finger on grail human fragments
utilizing the nature of their rotten spirited and damned egos
Instigated for destruction
to give laughing the rest of a devastated world
to the future as a gift
filled with the smell of plague
with its father-death
not knowing
that the world wich was long time ago
it's grand mother
who has become a sick old witch
killed all emotions
that should have healed
the world should not be the rest of a damned ageChurch that's the farce where
Priest plays the main part
Crowds of believers
They come by habit

Come by habit
Cheap performance, zero belief
Everything is scheming
Miserable words with no meaning

They deceive everyday
Many stupid people
Seek more profounding thing
That the one you see

Mass that's only a play
Performed in the church week by week
Exactly the same
The public knows parts
Actors accompany them
Exactly the same

In the name of belief?

This is only cheap performance
Which has been lasting for ages
Deceives people just like you!
...it's only cheap performance...(Instrumental)Resopla el viento, cae la noche;
Entre las sombras, se oyen venir.
Tambores de guerra, furia inmortal,
Hasta la muerte, voy a luchar.
Firme marchando hacia la batalla,
Camino a la inmortalidad.
Firme marchando hacia la batalla,
Camino a la inmortalidad.
Tambores de guerra, furia inmortal,
Hasta la muerte, voy a luchar.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)"Song to hall up high" (Bathory cover)

I know you watch over me
Father of all the past
And all that will ever be
You are the first and the last

The watcher of all that lives
The guardian of all that died

The one-eyed God way up high
Who rules my world and the sky

Northern wind take my song up high
To the Hall of glory in the sky
So its gates shall greet me open wide
When my time has come to die

-In Memoriam of Quorthonthe vision of victory must be kept for new youth
Wisdom of the elder to be passed to those who walk the warrior's path.
The spirit of the master will dwell for all times
In the blade to be the heritage of our sons
You must exert all your strengths and courage
To make freedom more than a word for the dreamers.
All the amazing things we've built
Must not be tread upon by the everyday mob.
Be strong, no more killing brothers,
Betrayal of blood will be punished by torture and damnation.
Permit no more harm to my people.
Prevent defiling this unique kind.
May kings and chiefs throne in each memory of their noble deeds.
Brave he who falls, may he find peace and his name be spoken with respect.(Instrumental)Blood on the snow
Fire and fear in the night 
When our grandfathers fought
For the pride of our fatherland

Reality is in war
Winterkrieg
Hateful vengeance

Stop them now!

Steel in the air
We must never retreat
Our honour is forever gone

Never surrender

Perkele!Leave the vestibule of Hell 
And enter its highest sphere 
Never have sinned, but unbelieving 
The place of the unbaptized children 

Credo in un Dio crudel (2x) 

Meet Minos the judge of the dead 
Descend the slope to the second sphere 
Swarms of people flying in the sky 
They have lived in voluptuousness 
In the swamp and shower of hail, the gluttons 
Hoarders and prodigals fighting eachother 
Deeper and deeper in the slough 
The furious and stubbons are swearing 
The worst sinners in this sphere 
Phlegyas brings you to the center 
Reek of excrements, smoke, rot and pestilence 
Groans, whimper, croak and swear 

Reach Acheron the sea of boiling blood 
Where murderers and torturers are punished 
Followed by the forest of the suicides 
Each tree containing the soul of a dead 
In a burning sand-desert, snowing fire flakes 
Homosexuals, lesbians, sodomists, unnatural love

Followed by the forest of the suicides 
Each tree containing the soul of a dead

Homosexuals, lesbians, sodomists, unnatural love 

Procurer and seducer in the first pit 
Whipped by black horned demons 
Flatterer in the next hole 
A river of excrements, a pit full of sh*t 
Corrupt, corruptible, thief, faker 
All have their own pools of blood 

Leave the vestibule of Hell 
And enter its highest sphere 

Credo in un Dio crudelTil hevn for frender
Over blanke egger str'mmet det blod
F'r kj'ttet ble fortaert av haermenn i blodige brynjer
Jeg taler om drapet i dunkle ord
I blodig stavn seilte langskip ut
I de iskalde b'lgedrag
R'dskjaeret varslet ufred
Vaapnene d'mte i fiendtlig m'te
Tida for hevn var kommet
Hett brant hatet i aapen kamp
Til glede for 'rn og ravn
Livl'st ligger frender
Banesaar ble gitt til foten som satt paa fiendens hals
Hevn... som varg i skog plaget av sult
Hevn... h'yt mot himmelen hornene skinner
De naableike livl'se hender
Var iskalde
Overstenket av valdogg
I nattem'rkret blir makten st'rreLeaving my home
Across the lands
over mountains
To a nameless place

Now I have, I have to go
To foreign land to feed my family
Now I have, I have to go
And I don't know if I will ever return to you

Leaving all I love
Not for gold
Or glory
For aliment

Now I take my sword, my shield
I will be prepared for this fight and I am not afrait
Now I take my axe, my spear
I will be prepared for this fight and I will live, not die

Hold my hand because my heart is full of pain
Look in my eyes - am I a warrior or just a man?

Refrain:
"This is the fate - of the fighting men
To live or to die - only for honour
This is the curse - of the brave men
To be one of many thousands"

We reached that land
Of gold and weed
Of water and meat
We have to win

Now I have, I have to fight
At this place to feed my family
Now I have, I have to be strong
And I don't know if I will ever return to you

The weapons strike
Arrows all around
Reaper's scythe
I am falling

Now they broke my sowrd, my shield
I thought I was prepared for this fight but I failed
Now they took my axe, my spear
I thought I was prepared for this fight and now I have to die

No one holds my hand and my hart is full of pain
Look in my eyes - I am not warrior, I am a man

Refrain(Instrumental)To the storm of the war 
I ride in violent rage 
Not feeling the fear 
Without remorse I strike 

I fight for glory 
For honour and my gods 
Hear my song of hate 
Hear my WARCRY!Through the silent and motionless forest, 
They go, whispering by the wings 
And mysterious sliding, a rustle of leaves, 
A noiseless step of Progenitors,
The Oldest Animals gather round Him

Raven, Keeper Of The Gates 
Deer of Seven Horns, Keeper Of Time 
Ancient Owl, Old woman of Night 
Eagle, Lord of Air, Sun Eye 
And the Salmon, the Oldest of Them, 
The Wisest of Wise 
He welcomes and blesses them, 
And they honor him, Cernunnos

Tree roots grow out of the ground
Gossip in the darkness in the magical patterns
Of roots and branches complicated the throne of the Master
Witching Horned Master of the Green Eternal Forest

Under the Crown of the Deer Horns
Two bright green eyes twinkling, 
Reflected in the dark
At the forest gates behind him

Things at dusk were not clear
Nothing in the darkness does not claim to ultimate truth
Forest shadows and your imagination 
Allow you to see everything as you see, 
And not as it is

Flocks of prey owls and ravens 
Circling over the branches of trees, 
Sheltering by wings the moon and stars
Grievous wolves and terrible beasts 
Of withcing forest prowl 
In windbreaks and thickets

You may pass through the gates 
Of the green darkness, 
Only if your heart will beat 
In unison with the pulse of the forestThere' s no sin on this earth
Witch we don' t cart around
The first temptation happened long ago
Sensing the mood of our lord
Ready to abortWe know that
this is the final straw
There' s no hope, our punishment was
life here on earth
There' s no time to go and say a final word
Dark night bird a 'soaring in the scarlet sky
Clawing wounds everywhere it flies
Rain and wind reproaching, tharshing
down from high
Thunder clapping in the dark of night
We know that it' s over,
now there' s no more hope
We' re all scared as we drink one
last final toast
Looking to theheavens, standing here forlorn
This dying world awaits a lethal, deadly storm.
The quiet before the storm, fatal powers dawn
Our mouths just cannot speak,
our hearts all miss a beat
Awaiting the final moment, our souls bear
a thousand rodents
Watching for the straw that pierces and tears
our souls to pieces
No pain, it burns and maims!
No pain, we' re to blame!
Feel the scorn of the final dawn,
the lightning bolts of the fatal storm
Almost all perished here last night
But standing side-by-side
The last example of human life
They must start a new-sell
Waking now from their spell
Everything must start again from down in hell...God just take my heart and my mind
As long as I'm alive, I pray
I believe only you can do
Only you make this world brilliant

Where is the place I have to get to?
And I must find
Take me there

God... Now I really wanna say this
Ah. Please take me
To the Promised Land
I really wanna get there
And l pray to god
I am alive

Time after time, I try to find it
Long way to go
There is no way out
I know it's too hard to find it
But I feel my heart beat
I'm alive

Where is the place I have to get to?
And I must find
Take me there

God... Now I really wanna say this
Ah. Please take me
To the Promised Land
I really wanna get there
And l pray to god
I am alive

I remember the words you said
In front of me
Your voice is still alive
Time after time
I try to see your face in my heart(Instrumental)Magic of my ancestors
Invoke an animal powers
Embrace the lights reflections
When attractions to chaos
Stunt thou growth
Embrace the creation
Speak to me warrior, who walks in balance
With goodness in his heart
Teach me the mysteries of rebirth
So I may understand
Let me fall into deep waters
Of wisdom and intuition
Grant passage too flow to and from life
Primal strength hidden in a secret source
Let me rise from the light of chaos
To reflect in your glory
Into the darkness that embraces light
I rise from the shadows of myself
To rise to a yet greater brighter hope within myself
Creation and destruction are one
To the eyes who can see beauty
Son of Odin, I thank thee my wise and beautiful lord(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Listen to the cold winds of war
Chasing over the battlefields

Feel the day coming back again
See the first shafts
Breaking their way down from sky

A natures new call
A call to wake up
The Time of a bright goddess

God of sun
True defender of light
Flight for the pagan believers

God of sun
Spread the cold winds of war
Get away all dark creatures

Demon is crying in anger
Knowing its end is near
Being afraid of the white sword

Demon is crying in desperation
Knowing it will never win
As long as heathen way exists

So never forget the pagan way
or perhaps one time
the gods will forget youBack into the days of old
In a story left untold
Lived in a kingdom o so small
the fairest maiden of them all
Blood red lips and a milk white skin
She was a beauty without sin
Cursed with virtue of innocence
That would lead to her decline

For their lived, a queen
Ever dressed in black in a castle cold
who searched, in vain
For the secret of...eternal youth

As time drew near
Her own death became clear
The queen began to despair
For what if she died
Before her time
Unwanted, unloved and alone

She summoned the hunter
For the maidens heart

To place it into the cold
Hands of death

And he followed the maiden
Into the woods

Under the cover of night
He stroke her down
In the light of a pale moon

As death drew near
She shed a tear
That melted frozen snow

That coloured red
As she bled
And blew her final breath

Back into the days of old
In a story left untold
Lived in a kingdom o so small
the fairest maiden of them all
Blood red lips and a milk white skin
She was a beauty without sin
Cursed with virtue of innocence
That would lead to her declineWintertide has begun
The wind is whispering of evaporated hope
As I lie here
On the icecold ground
Drowning in my blood
Drowning in desperateness

Far from here, I see a light
Let myself fall, set my fist

Lost are the times of heroic deeds
Only disorder an death remained
Faith is gone
Everything plunges into darkness
And I wait until I fade away

Far from here, I see a light
Let myself fall, set my fist(Instrumental)Wandering on the path of the white mountain
Human forces faraway from here
We celebrate the morning over peaceful landscapes
Through wolves' earth and ravens' sky

To the lake together we walk
Searching for the northern lands
Forever keeping all its foolish secrets
Buried under last night's snow

Blizzard above the shadows of old trees
Begins an endless and skillful fight
Beyond what can be reached by human
Mother nature, hold off cursed souls

The peaceful morning resumes its duties
Among the blanket of mother nature's wrath

We walk under the resurgent sun
ForeverHowl and writhe,
Where many glooms abide
Die forlorn,
Where guts are opened wide
Ashen hew,
There's nowhere left to hide
Pagan wrath,
Where no one can survive
Sallow grey,
On raven wings we ride
Hellish gore,
Iron and bone collide
Tombless slain.
Conquer and divide
Wretched tears,
Rome we have defied

British Gods,
Gods of evermore
Condatis
Hear the forest roar
Taranis
Craving blood and war
Avernus
Above the eagle soars
Camulus
A feast of guts and gore
Bellunos
Binding oaths we swore
Cernunnos
Cometh the dragons claw
Andraste
On spines we all shall gnaw

Bonded by blood
We shall die to the last(Instrumental)years of sorrow, 
days of wrath
masses are oppressed,
a dead end path

Days Of Wrath...Diagnosis has been verified...

Patient is not certifiably sane.
...Starting recreation process...

Softly
All of what you have ever been through
Will be erased by languidness
Why should someone hesitate
To give all his mind for salvation
They will refuse
To get a picture of my woes
Healthy but braindead I shall rest forever...
Would rather die
Then paying for
All the things I've never done
In the end there must be a way

Abrupt
All of what you have been aware of
Will come back to you as your distress
Why should someone hesitate
To give all his mind for sedation
When
All of what you have ever been through
Will be erased by languidness
Why should someone hesitate
To give all his mind for salvation
I'm getting weak
All the militancy is gone
Lust for convenience is absorbing me
I'm getting tired
Of what I
Have ever been
I'll live my life in vain
And turn away
Of all my odds

Abrupt
All of what you have been aware of
Will come back to you as your distress
Why should someone hesitate
To give all his mind for sedation
When
All of what you have ever been through
Will be erased by languidness
Why should some hesitate
To give all his mind for salvation
They will refuse
To get a picture of my woes
Healthy but braindead I shall rest forever...
Would rather die
Then paying for
All the things I've never done
In the end I will see a light

We
All have to reach
A certain point of hopelessness
To recognize how deeply we are lost
We'll have to change
Our selves
To break the chains of selfishness
In the end we are all strong enough
We
All have to keep
Our deepest consciousness
To not forget how independent we can be
Don't let your self
Be controlled for eternity
'Cause in the end we are all wise enough
To come through(Instrumental)Way up north in darkened times
Ablazing through nine worlds
Only known by the elder ones
Trembling all of heaven's depth

Bursting out in elemental force
Undefeatable, so it's told

A glance far in descent
Forgotten signs, rediscovered

Never will be, once lost
The whispers of dead, be free

Gleaming the colours of night
Riding on wings only to fade
As if a might has been conjured
Since primordial times in loss

The breath of god's kindled for new
Rage and riot a battle in black
Strongh old of heaven in faint
Since sunna will awaken once more

Shrouds of light alre dy ascent
With them the circle enclose s
The pale glow is suppressed
Surrendering, but not defeated

Ready to enliven all night again
Joining the fight, tirele s sly
Following the change of the sunwheel
Awaiting a final command to chargeWith blinded minds we walk this earth and shun what we've been told
through time and tide what tempts a man to make an offering of gold?
To kindle the eternal flame that burns within my soul
accept this gesture, seal my fate, return my luck threefold.
And if this world is cruel to me, my destiny is known
my footsteps echo for all time, these paths I walk alone.

through tired eyes I see the signs, the majesty of you
As I cast away my offering in the hope of a different view
the silent light is beckoning, the hidden voices cry
this fortune, yours, I give to you that no man can deny.

And when the years have passed for me and my tired heart beats slow
take me to the waters edge to make an offering of gold...(Instrumental)This Spectral Night is mine This Night of War swarms of forgotten
Souls Bleeding obscene In Cold Blood, Raise of the Evil Essence
I saw a Hole in the Sky And i took aim whoth a winning smile
At those brathless men Under the weight of weapons
Duelling unawareof that massacre reason
Magistra Mortis! With her cold glance She raises upon her victims
Erotic Vision So noble  and beauty Hidden in her Nocturnal cloak
In Cold Blood... In Cold Blood
Apotheosis of Misteries A gloomy Cold takes the night
In its unceasing journey That arrests the light
It falls swiftly Full of wrath and implacable hate
A lost forest Sombre and virginOffers its pure mantle So mild and regal
Painful and sad To a timeless battle Neither cause nor chice
In Cold Blood... In Cold Blood
This Spectral Night is mine This Night of War swarms of forgotten
Souls Bleeding obscene In Cold Blood, Raise of the Evil Essence
FIRE and perverse pleasure Among her legs Blood and torpor in her mouth.
Exhausted by the unfailing strokes of War My eyes are lifeless and shiny
Dismal expression but impassable A perpetual Fog is wrapping me
And it leaves no time to wonder But the Fear that never shall I see
The yearned light of My Sun
Death is staring at me, aiming no more ath the challenge But my eyes
My Journey begins Blood is sliding among the trees and wraps the forest
A red lake is swallowing my Life Death has chosen her eternal slave
In Cold BloodHeathens, heathens!Behind the gates of glory
a strange face appears
The darkness call upon thy face
Feel your mind fall in disgrace

From power of your sentence, tormented souls awake
Reflections of deepest hate
Upon my throne I listen the screams of pain

"The Beginning of the rites in the cold mist
Beneath the pale moon I strengthen my might"

Four thousand years over your soul I command eternally
Where the ravens will fly in the longest distances
I will be watching

In different lights, the mysterious eyes couldn't see my agony
See the sparks burning all the green
Ambicious creatures corrupted by the christianism
They will pay, they will pay for that!

Whispering voices summoning sins
see the wrath of the gods
See the winds crying out loud
draped in calamity, descend from me!

Hear my last words that came from a storm
Of a new breathe of the night
Call my name!

There's time to battle, may the past return to life
the destination is in my sword
In the deepest darkness of the woods I hear my name!

I walk on misty pathways, where the journey leads
I just follow my inner voice
Obey me! I'm the real god who was born immortalized
Hail me! I'm the real god who was born on fire and ice

I command with greatest pride, as I behold my kingdom and my vast empire
In large fields the bloody war, stormwinds sliding in the sky

Sword of the freedom attack the false ones, hurting your pride and destroying your beliefs
Fall on the edge and descend of your soul announce my coming

Eternal emptiness triumph over your mind and consume all victorious pride
Awake in gore nephast might
Shadows dancing in the deed roaring thunderDe roep van de raaf
Is de roep van oorlog
De stem van Donar's hamer
Hoor de noorder geest
Hoor de noorder geest
De glorte van de hamerstaal

Verpletter den Infidel
Christenhonden zullen sterven

Zij kunnen geen kant op
Ragnarok, Ragnarok
De waarheld van de goden
De draak zal komen

I mean in same condition, who is not trying to infringe
Treasures of creation and misteries of nature
Otherwise he feels confusion because that knowledge is gonna burn his mind
Consumer of the same day, walking in the clouds of ignorant lies
He cannot see the truth, unable to realize that the everquest is our life
The everquest is our life, but he prefers to deal with lies
He encroaches knowledge he had already infringed
The circulation of that action shows a picture of dead seed
Which will not grow in endless fields and will not underground
And won`t be cut by harvester who works for future life
Imagine hazy world, where no one takes effort to learn from another
The same mistakes in everyway, the same speaking in thy pray, and all still remains
Nothing again, nothing will change, nothing to gain in this world, it is so fatal
What`s gonna supervise? But still prefer to deal wit lies
It was once told that the more you gain the less you loose
Every time in various life i rush my pulse
To take out more than ever from our dimension
And use my knowledge in everquest in infinity convention
My knowledge maintenances non existence of duality
That means desolation, that means my reality
No my world is not so fatal
Because my life is the everquestI'm becoming another in the grey shades of the night
Watching the werewolf throne on the journey through the fog
Snow flakes blown on my hungry jaws and scornful face
I am the congealed yell of the forest in flames

White haggard eyes
White wolf cries
White storm arise
Night winter ride

Cosmic horde descendingg down the firmament of ice
Reflecting on the crystallized translucent lakes
Majesty of the inner black dusk, starless is the sky above
Eternal eclipse of ice as moonlight draws the path

Moonlight...

Freezing wings of nocturnal winds
Frostbiting blue muscles of my lycanthropic heart

Stellar constellations sketches
Wolf's sorrow crying out for the territory of the ancients...To be one of those
Who sway between depression and despair
For a life amongst their icons.
To be one who is chosen
A spectator in the theatre of their
Pathetic and pointless existence.
It kills me a little more
With every passing second
I sink into unfathomable tedium

I've been waiting for you for ages
You, who realise my splendour
And who know that eternity is insufficient
To celebrate our carnal union.

To be one of those
Who drift between suicide and anxiety
Unjustly suffering their rejection,
Only to be chosen
To ignite the theatre of their
Pathetic and pointless existence,
It heals me a little more
With every passing second
They sink into unfathomable Hell.

For an age I have tortured
Those who do not recognise the Excellence
And billions of humans
Won't be enough to contain my insanityThe Horned God guards this special night
Our breasts sparkled by the flickering light
We lie by the Beltane fires
As sunlight fades
As one with all nature's beasts
Pagan gods rise
Let us now feast
On our desires

The great Earth-Mother, the god with horns
Heathendom we praise
Our nakedness the sky adorns
With silver moonlights glaze

My body seems enslaved
Next to the fire, I'm falling down
I feed my heart, for what it craves
Witchcraft flows free 'neath midnight's gown

A prophet sober, a festering heart
A loving whore tears us apart
A cross for the fire, and our gods depart 

By the fire we lie
Ecstasy beneath the sky
Dance around, nature-bound, one with the galaxy
Celebrate the first of May with fertility

All witches gather for the great mother
And one upon an oaken throne
Fair maiden, walk by my side
Jump the fire and be my bride
Our faithful coven grants us a year
Wed by nature we'll be

Listen!
Whence he came he bore the cross
And with it came what he told of, what he held as dearest:
His god 

And this strange harbinger, he had eyes glowing with fire
When he told of god's glorious empire
And we were lost
The cross's shadow silenced all the laughter in the woods
All our love
It denied all our ancient gods
And wiped us...

Away!The sin is only way to live
Born and the unforgiven
There's no force to overcome
This full circle must be done
And no longer
And no more
I'll re-open
These old sores
Oh I see the inner struggle
Can't you see it, don't you know

Refrain: 
Hate, only hate 
Pain, only pain 
Rage, only rage 
Leads to every aim

No indulgence for us (x4)

Satisfy your lust
Sacrifice your soul
I will be the last
To watch and join this Fall

Now the time for us is lost 
Now here is only dust 
The ashes and the dust 
I can't believe it...

The sin is only way to liveNobody sleep the soul doesn't feel

Things unreal what they look to be
Things what all pass
We all hide with people that nobody knows
Things what all pass

Dreams unreal what all world live
The mind of people think

All is inverse
Death is life... life is death
Nodody thinks, they only live in their dreams
Nobody lives, all people are imaginary

White minds, only think in their words

In the end of the dream, nobody wakes

The dream nobody dreams

All is inverse
Death is life... life is death
Nobody thinks, the only lives in their dreams

For your heart, flows blood, flows the water
Think in life, how it's over... how endsShadows drawn towards the trees
And humming in the winter's night
Colossal stone at new moon stands
Where worshippers bow at its sight

Silent moans and saddened hearts
Of folk in famine, at wit's end
Calling to gods and ancestors
Linked with the barren land

The earthgoddess must grant her favour
Pray we're not mercy deprived
We offer scarce possessions
Since our fortune deeply dived

The demon-haunted children
Nightly cries feed fear alone
As hunger whirling down the snow
So chilling to the bone

We call upon Tanfana
Sacrificial liquid flows
On the altar stone of Tan's hill
Sanctioned by the sound of crows

Our tributes are subject to change
The trees are channelling our pleas
And from an edge of gold we know
It's Tanfana who sees

Endure the suffering, give more
As blood evaporates in air
Inebriation, dedication
Tanfana who's thereI stand alone at night waiting for my death in cold snow
take my soul and let's run in darkness for your pleasudre and for my doom
I'm your slave now , slave of dark , in my veins the blood is back
the light no more in my eyes, only hate and solitude!

I stand alone at night , winter cold and cold wind whispers
that I'm born here , in darkness , and forever i'll walk alone
I'm your slave now, slave of dark , in my veiins the blood is back
the light no more in my eyes, only hate and solitude!

Lord of death , release my soul , let me walk again
I reborn in darkness , here's my soul , let me fight again

Fighting against Christ , drink the bood of fallen ones
I curse the filthy cross and I sit on my bonemade throne
Fighting the light ones , joy to see those fuckers die
I triumph over them with my force and darkness

I'm now enslaved in darnkess , forged in a thousand hell flames,
my mind is now possessed by evil , supreme force of evil(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Honour 
That's what our ancestors were fighting for 
Pride and glory awaits the strong 
Supremacy of the ones of pure heathen blood 

Sing the song 
...Of hate 
...Of war 
...Of pain 
...Of Blood 

Where's the honesty and pride? 
Christianity corrupted peoples minds 
Disordered their souls, blanked their hearts 
What ever happened to honour? 
Anti-Christian souls must gather and fight 
Under the banner of the ancient pagan empire! 

Sing the song 
...Of honour 
...Of pride 

Sing the song of the past 
For it shall be the song of the future!On nights like this, my heart is sad
I dream and sing
For the deeds of glory, aeons passed.
Beneath the full moon
Cursed - Doomed
Let it be known
Where the blood of legends flows

Swords and rings, thrones of great kings
Eternal Hymns
Tales, come alive here through my strings
Where the blood of legends flows

Man, will you be remembered?
When your life line is severed
Or will you be forgotten?
Just dead and rotten.

Do you have dreams of greatness?
Or are you struck with blindness?
Will you be king or peasant?
Will I sing of your glory, too

You live and then you die,
You'll find the reason why
Just take a look inside,
And find the road to lightDarkness enclosed the forests,
as thousands of people marched into war.
The land was covered in snow.
Armed with sword and shield,
we followed the call of the wolves.
Our swords burned in flaming embers.
War, eternal war.
Thousands of warriors crashed onto eachother,
only hate reigned the events.
There was no light in those dark hours,
no hope, only death.
Endless pain enclosed us,
nothing was left back,
only the fire of our swords.

By AramathThe fogs of the night become my cloak
As ravens beckon with shadow-wings
I find the gate of obscurity, ancient as the wind
I drown in that dark mirror
Those ghouls beyond the door chant slowly
I begin my dance, for i see the thin shroud
The thin shroud of blackness, waiting for meTotal anarchy in the world
People are dying everywhere
Won't you see this everyday?
Will you do anything more?

Total agony in the world
Politicians steal what we have
World is dying everyday
Will you stay and watch it gone?

When you see me in the street
You can feel it in your head
The strengh which's inside me
You can feel it in your mind

When you see me in the street 
You can feel it in your head
The anger which's inside me
You can feel it in your mind

Total disorder in the world
People are starving everywhere
Won't you share it what you
Have the ones can make you beg too

Total destruction in the world
When you stay aside and clean
War is now to begin
Noone is going to survive

When you see me in the street
You can feel it in your head 
The fear which's inside me
You van feel it in your mind

When you see me in the street
You can feel it in your head
The pain which's inside me
You can feel it in your mind

-Don't believe of what they say-

The words can sound nice
When they're lying all the time
You feel good, you feel safe
'Cause they've poisoned your brain

There is always something wrong
They are good you're the worst
You're the rich they're poor
Look at it and think at all

When you see me in the street
You can feel it in your head 
The fury which's inside me
You can feel it in your mind

When you see me in the street
You can feel it in your head
The paranoid which's inside me
You can feel it in your mind

Total apathy in the world
Politicians don't listen what people say
Noone is going to react
Will you tolerate (psychical) stagnation

Total anarchy in the world
I'll resist and I'll fall
I'll refuse the rules of world
Together or alone I'll stand or fall

Total agony in the world
Everything is going to break down
Will you stand up against
Or will you slowly rot?In the twilight of the day
Do I see the sun disappear
Behind the bloodred horizon
I can feel the insatiable night
Consume all light
Emperor of the darkly time
Give my darkest gift
I have now entered your world
My hate is your spirit
And your hope to conquer the world
A realm of vicious creations
Came from he mistand rised
The dark knight have been entered
He is ferocious in his sight
A perfect murderer as he enter
The world oh mortals
This is the hour of darkness
Welcome to the devilnightGrey park look the same
and all days are pale.
I never thought it would rain this way.
I should be knowing that, it used to be me.

Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?

Your smile has decayed,
it will never be the same.
I never thought I would laugh again.
I should be knowing this, it used to be me.

Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?

Now it's dark and you're colder.
Now it's dark and I'm older.
Now it's dark and you're colder,
and you tell me my parks are grey.

Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?

Grey park look the same.
All the days are pale.
I never thought it would rain this way.
I should be knowing that, it used to be me.

Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while.
Is something gonna happen today?Smell of the wood, smell of the trees
Smell of the trees, echoes of the past
Rustling oaken leaves, oaken eddy which you cannot pass
Attracted by the secrecy, losing the notion of time
Relating intimacy to old legends, ancient fights

Dreaming about the roaring sky
About trees and thunder
Dreaming about forefathers
These secrets make me wonder
Stepping inside the mind of wood forlorn

Concentric circles, circles of the inner wood
Originate archetypes, the Celtic soldier and Robin Hood
Wandering in silence, wandering in myths
Step inside the history, live through the neolithic mood

Where the story starts
There the story ends
The mind is crooked
This realm it blends

Along the creek, leaving the realm of the world behind
From castles to battlefields, through  space and time

Along the creek, leaving the realm of the world behind
From castles to battlefields, through space and time
Over woodlands and deeps, although the mind is blind
Unconsciousness feeds these places with archetypes(Instrumental)As one with the land, my spirit awakens to natures call, enslaved for over a thousand years, I've returned to claim it all. False beliefs and poisoned minds, led by messiahs of the blind, convert or perish the choice they gave, bow to the church and become it's slave... it's slave... it's slave... it's slave! 
The shrines were burned, traditions broken, a culture denied, down to every token. Branded as heathens, our past was forbidden, yet deep in the earth, our remnants were hidden. 

Church and state condemning hate, while industrialism destroys our land, hypocrites when in the face of truth, they really don't give a damn, One thousand years of slavery ends, natural order reigns supreme, selection finally takes it's course, destroying their modern dream. 

BEFORE GOD, I was one with the land, I ran with the wolves in the glimmering moon, and they ate from my hands. BEFORE GOD, I witnessed the birth of fire, burning so bright in the dead of night, I was it's sire... it's sire... it's sire... it's sire! 

Disregard for nature so blatant today, the rivers are polluted, and the skies are gray A mighty revival can't come to soon, it's back to our roots, or our future is doomed. 

Back to the land, REBIRTH OF THE PAGAN MAN!!! Back to the land, REBIRTH OF THE PAGAN MAN!!! Back to the land, REBIRTH OF THE PAGAN MAN!!! Back to the land, REBIRTH OF THE PAGAN MAN!!!

And from the sky comes d

enormous water
Rivers have turned to ice

Dash down the water
Throw a log on the fire
And mix the flattering
wine and bind on round our foreheads
Soft ceremonial wreaths of spun fleece

We must not let our spirits give way to griefThe Glory
Retaking
The Pagan Kingdom Rises

The Glory
Retaking
We Bastards came to fight

The Heart of a warriors vibrates with the drums of war
Fighting side by side with the shells of brothers
In the veins of warriors flows the pagan blood
In the fields only the strong prevail

The Glory
Retaking
The Pagan Kingdom Rises

The Glory
Retaking
We Bastards came to fight

The heat of the battle was left behind

Remembering the brothers who lost their lives

In songs and dances at the moonlight path

Tonight we drink their epic wars

The Glory
Retaking
The Pagan Kingdom Rises

The Glory
Retaking
We Bastards came to fight

The gods gave us the power of steel

The fronts were never overcome

Bleed the weak and the strong prevail

Honoring the victory of the ancient blood


Pagan Pride!at the last stand of man
there is no room for compassion
any emotion set aside for war
blind fury in aggression
final sense in human existence
undo ourselves from our broken wings
the last struggle for humanity ends in mass destruction
chritian comatose
the final brutal action of a fiction believe
made able to face eternity
the stars of hope are passing away

darkness reconquers the dying world
infecting it with a plague of rot and gore
screams of disgust and horror
split your bones
the definition of pain
incarnated
any emotion set aside for war
undo ourselves from our broken wings

the last stand, the last fight
brutal war, merciless
the last stand, the last fight
stride forth, hellride

true spiritual nightmare
hell is the law
the last stand
mercilessLucking in the forest , in the shadows where I rule
The smell of wods empowers me , first step for my conjuction
for the Moon is granting me her mighty ancient power
and I will be a form of terror aiming for revenge
a pentacle of stars around my force of transformation
the magic of the wolf is settingright trough my constellation
over realms of darkness where the moon is the only light
Kerres and Jamel are satisfied
with human sacrifices...

The sun has fallen down and the moon is shining bright
I'ma attracted by hher lasciviouos light
my skin turns dark as a mantle of grey grews up fastt
fast as my run thought these unholy woods...
Searching for human preys .. in the gloomy dark
his wi be the nholy night of wolves?
No pity for you , you on my bloody way?
I'll rape your life until the end!

blood is spitting everywhere , while I open your skiin
interiors fly away and legs and arms are mutilated 
tragic end of you , blasphemic devastation
for the invasors of my heathen realm of mighty nature
human are passed side by side by the power of wolf

Hirpus blood is pumping through my inhuman black veins

Hirpus - cult of the wolf
Maleventum - cult of bllood
Lykaion - dominions of the beastThere he stands on the hill
proud, strong and wired
destroyer of worlds, warlord and
black master of fight
chose one of the caos gods,
bathed in blood and evil by his free will

We are the chosen one
We are the chaos lords

hear the marching on the muddy ground
like warorums it sounds
sweet music to us to worship
havoc itself

the sweet miasma is longing for you
from the darkened realm
may the plagues and flys devour you
and may pain be the only truth
for you eternally

We are the chosen one
We are the chaos lords

we`ll follow our lords into this war
and we`ll be like wolves among the sheep
to bring your world to fall
the golden throne you`ve build
war will cover the wolrd
and chaos will replace yor order

foreverWrite blasphemies on church's wall
Take pleasure pissing their temple
Crap on their fuckin'altars
Molest nuns sluts of god

Vandalic rides we ride
According Black Metal dictates
Violation,desecration,masturbation

As wander as angry wolves
Amongst woods and cemeteries
Walking (the) true Black Metal way
Make of rottenness and brutality

Vandalic rides we ride
the virgin Mary weep blood
Profanation,desecration,masturbation

Screams and laughters
Break the silence
Strinking upon the mountain we stand 
Felling venom in our souls
Felling the dark adrenaline

Burning desecration...
At the dead of night...
Our fuckin'pagan fury !Caressed by blood, with glory shines the blade in a dying warrior's hand
Oh gods in the sky, light up our brother's way to the gates of Asaland

In dustclouds is the battlefield, raging winds screamed thy name
From the portals on high as the valkyries came
Bold son of that nordic tribe, see the ancestors' pride
Ride up on your way to your place by their side

Your mortal remains we have placed upon a hip, sword and charger by your side
With the gods' breath in sail the dragon-headed grave leaves the shore, enclosed by mystic light

Here we stand by thousand torches' light as time carries away thy burning tomb
Raising our swords up to the sky to cry out our last hail to you
And the flames, the flames light up the ocean's cold black womb

Heil

A blazing ship drifts across the sea, black sails hang from the mast
Must be a viking's journey to the warriors of the past

And as the night brings down a veil of gloom, sudden lightning cuts the air
The hammer of Thonar strikes from heaven's shore, mighty winds blow through my hair

Bold son of that nordic tribe, see the ancestors' pride
Ride up on your way to your place by their side
In Asgard we will meet again, chosen warriors' land
Where those live who died with sword in hand

By thunder and lightning with the gods we will ride
Beyond blackened clouds in the northern sky

A blazing ship drifts across the sea, black sails hang from the mast
Must be a viking's journey to the warriors of the pastThe winds blow over the hills and Lug walks with me
song of fire and blood
I am in the forest where the
roots of my forefathers grow deep
I follow the linx way towards the fullmoon
and I stand upon my ground
I am into motherland's heart
All sons of storm, thunder and rain... Don't walk alone
My hands... They are what I am
My mind... Is what I am
My heart... Is what I will be
The winds blow over the hills and Lug walks with me
song of fire and bloodFrozen in the ice........on the sorrow road to Stalingrad
Men of honour marched......to slay the growing red beast
Felled by snow and winds...but not by the Communist hand
They fought with no remorse...in the brutal winter of Russia

Blitzkrieg in the woods...war in the forest as in ancient times
Waiting for attack...they lay frozen in foxholes
Panzers screaming war...thousands died like stars in the sky
Fallen with pines and oaks...names buried by the leaves

(chorus)
Frontsoldatten......Aryan will
Frontsoldatten......Kill on command
Frontsoldatten......Power and might
Frontsoldatten......The bravest of all

Blood spilled on the snow....decorates an Iron Cross
Wrapped in barbwire....for decades to come
Comrades made to think...they fought against racial brothers
But they fought against the plague...to rid Europa of Judeo(Instrumental)Thy invocation: 

Hail, mighty warrior of doom 
Kliphoth, raven, rise up from the dark 
Rise up, fly high, earthquake shakes the ground 
Thunder, lightning, give me all your signs 

War, kill my enemies 
Let them drown in their own blood 
Come through 

Baal Romerac 
A 'Arab Zaraq 
Miliom Baal ReginonAmong the battlefield
The lifeless steel shines bright
Somebody's groaning near
He knows he doomed to die
Soon Semargl will bring them down
Into the land of the Chosen One
Where they will get their bless
Into the Reign of Silence
The last rays of the Sun
Are fading in their eyes
Among the Battlefield
The Lonely raven cries
So far away from friendly home
Out of the land of Thousand Bogs
And they preare to fade
Into the Reign of Silence
The cold touch of skies
To all those who die
The winds from beyond
Are bringing the Night
Almighty Peroun take us to your realm
Soon Silence will rule
In this Pagan Reign
The Wisemen in white
Said Blessed is who's died
Preparing the death
They are making the Rites
Semargl will meet
Them at Golden Gates
Now there is no hate
Just equal in death
The Radiant God is fading away
The Gloomy Semargl is coming to change
They silently talk to the Homeland
Good Bye. This time is to die
Their life now flows away
And souls now leave their hearts
And nevermore again
They'll be back to the land of Sun
The last rays of the Sun
The last drink of the air
And they prepare to die
To go to Silent ReignBlack clouds appear in the sky 
Hide the sun
Snow freezes the fields and brings the death
Terrifying shadows haunt the whole north
The nine Kingdoms doomed to the end

The tree of life burns on its base
In the signs of war about the dark
Under flag of war all the north
Odin calls all realms for the clash

Oceans violently
Drowns the north
The snake overflows the seas to the lands
Spewing its deadly poison
Everywhere
Pests contaminate warriors

The tree of life burns on its base
In the signs of war about the dark
Under flag of war all the north
Odin calls all realms 

The gods fought with honor for existence
Forever die for this world
The heroes fall with honor for existence
Forever die for this world

The gods fought with honor for existence
Forever die for this world
The heroes fall with honor for existence
Forever die for this worldCountess of the night

Those eyes like balls of fire
I see there's no way out

Her thirst for blood make me afraid
Owned by her demoniac beauty

I offer my blood to satiate her thirst
An immense pleasure takes my body

Her mistresses are attracted by the smell of my blood
Devouring my body in adoration to the countess

I leave behind my Imperfect and Heavy body
This is the death, destroying my destiny

Night demons contemplate my funeral

Upon the moon light
My body has taken life again
I'm free for all the eternity
The countess brought the immortality

By the horizon
I hear voices coming from the forest
She calls my name
The countess lost her immortality

Sacrifice made to save my spirit
Her body in a putrid way
offering no more life
Tears dropping from my face
I take her mortal rests with me for all the eternity

Countess of night - Calls my name
Countess of night - Upon the moon light
Countess of Night - Tears in my face
Countess of Night - Forever(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Blizzard would pierce the heart with the pain of Snows
The Spirit would rise in the Wrathful Fury
Through the brightest moment towards the Eternity
All the Mysteries would be revealed
The Secret of the Pride would appear
The Secret of the Bravery, the abomination of the fall
At once you'll forget the carefulness
At once you'll step towards the death with faith
Its' joy to spill the Blood

For the Sacred Land
Would shine upon you as a light of one thousand stars
The warcry of your brothers
It would be for you
The call through all the weakness, the bridge
Through the cowardness
Spit with scorn upon the barking dogs
The mud doesn't hold any memory
With your generation you would march hand in hand
Fight 'till Death for the native snows

A storm roaring in the night
...hatred
Dusk glean with the coldness
...hatred
Raven soaring in the distance
Beholds revenge
Glare, blackest glare in his eyes
-inspiration
At the first sound of the battle
Charge into the fight
Tearing all apart
The Spirit is born
Shadows for the age of yore
Rush in the twilight
Scarlet blood of sunrise
Remains in Infinity
Skies rip open with the thunder

Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
Will die together in the end

God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your neverending curse

I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
Will die together in the end

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
Now leave the mortal world

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
Will die together in the endSaying - we are warriors
Warriors - for the olden faith
Telling - to be friends
Shouting - we are the best

Traitors of faith
Turn around forget their names
Hate
Hate
Hate

Now they are gone
What did they feel before

Saying - we have new beliefs

Telling - To be open minded

Traitors!
Traitos of faith

Listen - You are nothing
Traitors of faith(Instrumental)Fire in the sky the signal of the battle
Death bells proclaim the beginning of the fight
From far I see them profiling the mountain
The Black crow brought the sign

Ashes in the castle
Fire in the horizon
Swords of blood
Attacking my kingdom
I invoke the master of war tonight
Master, bring me your power
My soldiers are weak and tired
In this journey to the eternal glory

Fire on the Horizon
Swords of Blood
Attacking my Kingdom

The path to the fire
Along the dark forests we march
Singing rites of war
Drums chant the song of death
Pagan Hordes preparing the attack
Without mercy
Without remorse
Only death by the sword

Bring us the power of your sword
Shed over us the glory of blood
Against the fire in the top of the mountain
Riding in your black horse
Make worth your black spirit
Master bring us your power

Fire on the Horizon
Swords of Blood
Attacking his Kingdom

Decapitate the motherfucker king(Instrumental)I walk through the veil of time
thousands of years have passed by
My journey is not over yet
I can see the heroes of past days
Long forgotten traditions
destroyed by the changing times
Despised by Christian preachers
The legacy of my forefathers
Lying on the ground

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

We live again
Ressurrected from the pyre
Never will fall
We are still burning

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

Now the winds of
fortune are coming
the old powerful flames
are burning
An age old believe
is risen again
ressurrected from the ashes
of pyre

We live again
Ressurrected from the pyre,
Never will fall
We are still burning

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

Where is your god
can you see he failed
Where is your god
nailed to the cross
Where is your god
abandoned from all
Where is your god
why your are afraid
to see the truth
give the burning flame on
let fall the ash

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

Now the winds
of fortune are coming
the old powerful flames
are burning
An age old believe
is risen again
ressurrected from the ashes
of pyre(Instrumental)I dream I see brave new world
Where there's no death, and no torments
A place where there's no horror of agony
And no tears of children

But it's a dream, it will be gone
Leaving the taste of bitterness
But it's a dream it will be gone
And awakening will come

I dream of my relatives I love
In my dream they are safe
But the world of the living IS so cruel
And I wake up on their graves

Reality, life's severe
Disease, war and pestilence
Death savouring, enjoyment of pain
Insanity grows
Serial killers in uniform
Sowing fear and woe
Darkness of minds, violence and hate
Insanity grows

I see your face everywhere
Without you I am dying
I wake up at night in emptiness
And all alone I'm crying

Now I make the last sacrifice
Throw my life on the altar
I feel this god longs for blood
So I leave this world for my own one
Now I make the last sacrifice
Throwing my life on the altar
Now I leave this world for my own one
Full of joy of creationDer Winter kommt...
-
-
-
Aaaah! Die Welt versinkt im Eis!
-
Und nichts bleibt!After creation
were born many nations
Sharing the land and the seas
Making religions
spread out of their regions
Always praying down to their knees
People are crying
just before they die
And wondering
is this their fate?
Searching for a reason
they still live in prison
Repenting but now it's too late
Bloodthirsty waiting
for loud sobs to hear
Using the path to law
Subordinating the people by steel
Baptizing crowds in a row
Chorus:
In the holy writes
The lies are overflow
On my rising way
Just vengeance is my lawMagiclava bubbling in cauldron
Watching in fog the fall of a feather
The tale of pain and torture
A shaman harridan hears it
Yet her fading voice doesn't speak.
Blessed past among black clouds
Heartbeat lets me fly
Bestial power that rives inside
Not one soulfighter-embryo.
The malleable glimmers
Treachery led by severity
Let life flow no more
Rotten-hilted lash
The won't be a weapon
In the hands of future
Only consumption
And cracking this
The heart of the horse
Won't beat any more
Grey-haired,bear-handed barbarian
Spills his blood in vain
There is no need
For days growing older in cells.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)See them fall
in drawings on cave walls
from centuries gone
their history fading

Oh how they rose
in grandeur and majesty!
But their magick was too strong
It dragged them down and they drowned
in their own greed for more
Their hunger for wisdom

and the old ones they say
that the sky has not always been this grey

They held their words in their hands
sent knowledge through sky and light
but forgotten their Mother
their place in the web of this ancient way

A tenuous grasp of a small part of Nature
and a future they'd never live to see
Razed forests for towers
but the waters came rushing in

Oh how they shone
in grandeur and majesty!
but their magick was too strong
it dragged them down and they drowned
in their own greed for more
and a future they'd never live to see

And the old ones say that the
sky has not always been this way

Look beyond these sands my sons
and gaze into the past centuries forever lost
A time where seasons thrived
in light of a brilliant sun

But rang aloud a clamor of greed
A foul and odorous blood they drained it dry
and choked the light from their skies

All reason came to an end
while cowering in sterile tombs
Their seasons came to an end

This is the wherefore we break our backs
to wrest life from this soil
and attend to the beat of Her feeble heart
I beseech that your sons will know as wellthe winter has came again
freezing my beloved fatherland
valleys fall asleep wrapped in snow and grey mist cold
woods are singing with howling winds of sorrow

Slavic soil , now an frozen majesty
nature sleeps , but warriors guard their realm
bathed in wonderful snowfall
embraced by the cold of the december moon

great mountains as glacial palaces rising towards the sky
howling of wolves in grimness of dark can be heard
raven dance within cyclones of malevolence
and barbaric red holocaust clouds storms skyline

above
Slavic soil , now an frozen majesty
where
nature sleeps , but warriors still guard their realm
eternally
bathed in wonderful snowfall
still
embraced by the cold of the december moon
forevermore
my world will sleep in arms
of dim and cruel eminent winter(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Look out behind you
a thousand faces wait
Waiting for excuses
now before it's too late
You have to tell them
how you feel to see
A thousand corpses
floating upon the sea
Screaming, screaming loud
The victims round all around
Bloodstained soldiers
are marching through the night
Abiding by the orders
thinking that's the right
You have to tell them
how you're ashamed of this
Nothing is changing
praying down on your knees
Chorus:
How many gods are living in this world
And which one is repressing the right
He must be a runaway
Cause he is missing in every fightI have torn the angels' wings. 
Thrown gods off of their thrones. 
I'm searching for the one 
Who will help me find the sun 

I am unworthy of your grace 
I wear a dead man's face 
A bastard's bastard son 
A creature who came undone 

What have I become? 

My anger is awry 
As I scream into the night 
A fire burns inside 
The rage I cannot hide 

My mask has grown heavy 
Without it I am free 
As I wander earth alone 
I hope to find my home 

Someday will come my dawn(Instrumental)I try to bury feelings
I try to dig deep hole and bury everything
You hope that time will wear out and will kill all
Like trees with strong foots so deep that you may hurt
Yourself to uproot

Not in this life but in which one?
Not in this life but in which one?

When we will succeed to see the dawn?
When we succeed to feel the heat?
When we will succeed to find the right way
When we will succeed to escape from this fog?

I try to go on and leave all behind
I try to see but there is fog
You hope to succeed to go away so far

But i carry them inside and nothing will succeed
To remove them from me

Can you tell me why?
Not in this lifeWho was here born
Between two worlds
In forests hug
And haze of steppes

That from childhood,
Scarcely grew up
With sword unfailing will
Unite his life

As forefathers' graves are behind
And watchful steppe is ahead
Fate makes us to embark on the path
To take the road of the enemy

Put a spell, you, wind,
Words of mystery
Banish from my heart
Fright of fortuity

And on disturbed dawn
Blood saturated
Prophetic dream
Become reality

As forefathers' graves are behind
And watchful steppe is ahead
And life on the blade,
On the blade of glory

And last trip,
To the legends.(Instrumental)So pure the passions, overwhelming the shattered remains, all lost for the once so giving
Searching further, far from the soil, there is nothing left, no light for the living

Reaching out in hope, stretching out towards blackened skies
Thunder hunting down your whispers towards the heavens
The eye can see the dooming of dreams, cracking through the false, the mountain overwhelming
With the angels seduced through unholy rites, your wounds are open and starving, terror upon you, feeding the terror

Falling from the sky, the ashes of heaven
The wind sweeping away the spirits of Christ
Lonely lies the prays, forgotten are the symbols of a brighter distance
Feast upon the slaves, the king of temptation... the king of temptation...

Hordes of demon possessed, crawling in masses, feeding the fires arising from the depths
Ravens swirling the empty landscapes, the dark lord harvest through the possessed

Fall for ruler of the earth, Satan

Masses of chaos, inlicting the eternal damnation
Masses of war, ending allBefore the twilight, the black birds sings
& the black crows peck the eyes of kings
In the battles tumult, I can hear the wailing banshee
Pendragons son is fallen on ground foul with death
 
Under winters empty sky, upon mouldering ash and bone
Great heroes collide on mist silhouetted fens
The baying of war horns, an eerie ode to sable garb of woe
Where cloven heads fall like seeds upon the dirt.

Carrion Crows over Camlan, Carrion Crows over Camlan                         
Carrion Crows over Camlan, Carrion Crows over Camlan
 
With sundered limbs and silent screams
That rest upon this dreadful empurpled plain
We ghosts of fallen oaks
And graven faces of the slain
 
Warriors heave and groan. Gaping mouths spitting blood
Mail clad wolves in the mist
Shimmering blades of blood-glazed steel
Killing under the cold moons glare


Gone are the British kings,
all swallowed by the Germanic holocaust pyres.
Lord Arthur is slain.
Great warriors laid upon countless biers,

Culhwch Peredur, Galath, Cadwr  Olwen, Pwyll, Manawyddan,
Arawn, Gwydion, Bedwyr, Garanwyn, Gwalchmai, Trystan, Cadog, Mofran,
Llywarch, Medraut , Eliwlod,  Druadwas, Bradwen Gwalchmai.

Morrigan casts her spell with dark runes cast
Her thunderbolts of murder and bleak pale slaughter
Dragon and raven standards broken,
Tall ashen shafts ruddy with gore
 
War is a shapeless stygian chaos
Where gods of Annwn collide
Affallach awaits in Avalon
The weary sleep of the slainI cry
Behind All The Sadness,
Lay Pieces Of Shattered Peace
As my vision gently awakens ,
by the whispering of your name
I find myself lost in this world ,
no sight could be compared
with what is painted before my eyes
Only in love a match can be found,
of what seduces me to the lusts
of my emotional outbreak
whose sweet scents I blindly embrace
still the immortality of it would conquer it all
it lifts me above my twisted conscience
torn away from all that ever mattered
I see the real face
with a neverending beauty blessed
On my knees , I seek my shadows key
The light of your presence guides me
blessed with this starlight key
I commence the undestined journey
You're the nature's gift
You are the one that makes my heart rich
Now we see the night
We gather as oneBeyond the howling of the night 
Full moon awakes the powers 
Beyond the sea and far from light 
He cannot tolerate the Devil 

Sun and Moon go over the sea 
Fetch back the souls ethralled by the Devil 
Bring back the life from the dark paths of hell 
Unleash the magic to ward off the evil witch 

Clash of the forces of chaos and order 
The night battle of the holy and of the damned 
Roaming the woods in the form of a wolf 
Prowling the village to grant the prayers of man 

Livestock, grains and fruit of the Earth 
Stolen were by the witches 
Soul of the werewolf, the Hound of God 
Nocturnal journeys, the charmer, the healerHow simple to lose the hope
How hard to bear the pain
To see veiled eyes again
To hold numb body...
Breathless I am

Some blue eyes wet by ache...
Warm hand caress' my back...
You're alone now to walk our common roads...

I touch the past to ease the soul...
And I still see the light severe...
Carving in my flesh

He shall guide you
Over the abyss of eternal sorrow
And he'll be there forever as you shall know
To help you deal with death pulling your hand... Towards me...

And again I crave the other shore...
Just like then when I saw dying...
And a piece of my heart deceased...
With something closer...
Than I ever was to meThe sky is clear and the moon shines bright
The stars burn through the trees
The night is black and the snow is white
All things seem to be unseen

The glowing eyes of animals around staring at me
The cold wind blows into my face
Like fire does it seem

Full moon shines searing down
The day shall never come
My tears are running from my eyes
My blood spills from my arms

I am immortal I can't die but I will feel deep pain
My eyes are red, my hair is black all my kingdom is

Eternal is dark forest
Eternal is the night
Deep dark forest eternally

The sun rise up I clear believed
The forest sight in me
But winter is. The days are short
And dark are all the trees

The sun goes down, the twilight comes followed by the night
Silent stands the deep dark forest and the moon shines bright

Eternal is dark forest
Eternal is the night
Deep dark forest eternallyFarewell of the summer
longing for separation and tears of the rain
restless mind calms
I am humbly grateful
clear sky has fallen a step lower
feeling is more cosy
there's safety in autumn
soft autumn twilight

after frosty night I find the sun from soil
maple's golden skirt has fallen under the tree
illuminating the black soil

blaze of Ruska colouring still it's sheathing
before the arrival of Marras
(it is time to rest and calm down)Crimson fire of hatred burning deep inside my soul
A storm of pain and misery I bring
The doom of your hypocrisy, the ending of your ways
Nothing will be standing, not a thing!


Cant you feel your walls crumbling around you?
There's nowhere left to hide, nowhere left to run
Cant you feel your world falling down around you
When the call of thunder beckons you must follow...


Into the eye of the storm, your destiny awaits you
In the eye of the storm, where natures fury reigns
In the eye of the storm, cloud of wailing terror
In the eye of the storm, this hour will be your last


Lightning rages in my eyes, thunder in my voice
The storm is raging deep within my veins
When the time comes to unleash it on you, to let my fury out
The storm will devastate your evil reign


Cant you feel your walls crumbling around you?
There's nowhere left to hide, nowhere left to run
Cant you feel your world falling down around you
When the call of thunder beckons you must follow...


Into the eye of the storm, your destiny awaits you
In the eye of the storm, where natures fury reigns
In the eye of the storm, cloud of wailing terror
In the eye of the storm, this hour will be your lastthere was a woman sent by Apoll
priestess of beauty and wisdom
born out of a snake to speak true and foretell
to answer the questions

oh Pythia, tell me the truth
say what will be in my future
oracle of Apoll what is to come?
I'll offer you all to get in known

in the woods of Delphi is her home
temple of our future
there the priestess does her duty
to open time for men
she breaks the laws of nature
to say what will be
and many men are coming there
to take a look behind the veil

white robes and long hair
the eyes are opened wide
she and her sisters seeing the way
we're going to walk
through light or darkness we will go
they know what will come
only the priestess reveals the path
but she speaks in puzzles

Pythia is seeing the end now
we're going to fall
future is black and dust
our final days are here?
men are suffering in Tartaros
not a single one was saved
and if that is what she sees
we are lost

never listen to a prophecy
you shall walk your way
and if pain is there
let it be

oh Pythia, please keep the truth
and what will be in my future
oracle of Apoll, what have you done?
I'll offer you all to forget(Instrumental)- Bodies consecrated to the earth
- Spirit to the light . . .

- Life can't be infinite
- Only pain is eternal

Cry for the ruined time
You've lost to understand,
The meaning of life will stay a mystery
But you now have the answers about deathWith power and Might this storm wind blows
Tear down the Christian monuments this night
Take hold of our trembling Enemies bodies
Fear the force of the pagan storm

Since 2000 years
we hear these lies
every day and every night
since the time of our infancy

All these invented stories
The peoples' mind
poisoned by wrong
promises A heart full of
fear to suffer to suffer purgatory

With power and Might this storm wind blows
Tear down the Christian monuments this night
Take hold of our trembling Enemies bodies
Fear the force of the pagan storm

But time is coming
and the first free thought
is running trough your head
But deep in you heart
you can feel something
is wrong with this story

In ancient times this wind was born
grows up again, to a storm
We ride on its wings and fly through the night
together we stand and we fight

With power and Might this storm wind blows
Tear down the Christian monuments this night
Take hold of our trembling Enemies bodies
Fear the force of the pagan stormA bid farewell 
To those who dwell 
In this new found land 
Mand a blood drop have fell 
On this ground once so evil 
Each drop another story to tell 
Of a heroes death upon the hillONDERGANG(lyrics: Ezra, music: Dries)

Val aan! Als verdediging,
slacht, slacht om te leven!
Oogst, oogst de vijand,
En spies hun hoofd op een paal!

Nu ik heers...
Word ik aangevallen in de rug,
neergestoken, bloedend...
bloedend tot de dood.

Mijn dood werd omhelsd
door de levensboom,
De aarde neemt mij terug,
terwijl de raven mijn vlees eten.

Een duistere hemel waait voorbij,
op dit moment dat ik sterf.
Het licht in mijn ogen schemert,
terwijl de pest en oorlog ons neerhaalt.

De strijd is bijna verloren,
maar bied weerstand tot Walhalla!
Treur niet om mij,
want uw tijd komt nog...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Reflected light
Over mountains in skies
Attracting the braves
But shine so bright
That crystal born
Inside the stone caves
In stained morning dew
And tears of the elves
Tell me dad what was in beginnin' of all
I want to know
Answer me who was elves and gnoms
Where they hiding?
Tell me about heroes of the ancient world
Why they gone out?
Answer me why the people lying today
before the face of God?
Please tell me now!

Ravens spinning round
over mountains of Bohemia
Ravens feel the warm flesh,
ravens see the crystal castle
Which stand on rock
but around stands besiegers armies
Last elves throwing arrows
from the crystal walls

They shields the friends
who departs from the land of mortals
They know their time is pass
New god taking over
desecrating the air by his breath
New god with mild smile and sword

Snows turnin' red by the blood,
crystal fragments over
Nature's creatures
are howling leaving that land
Firstborn goin' west
beyond great ocean plain
Somewhere foreign lands
will hear their splendid songs

[Chorus:]
They blinded by tears
goin' out from their Motherland
Where they got the life
In beginnin' of the all
New god taking over
desecrating the air by his breath
New god with mild smile and swordAurora Borealis 
Your light, my guide 
Horse drawn into the night 
My conquest has begun 
I may never return 
For I'm the chosen one 
My destiny fulfills my life 
The journey into the unknown 
The stars help guide my journey 
To the northern lands 
The wolves protect me 
As I travel my journeyOnce I've seen the light. Once I've seem them fight. Once I've heard the call, a call from Gods to God.(Instrumental)Another day
Comes with it's misery
Another step
On path to shallow grave
Personal demons
Heading for the triumph
Unanswered questions
Bounded by the inner pain
As sun is dying slowly
For the night time to emerge
Full moon shines its early light
Like a blind witness of suffering

Cursed are all kings without a throne
In the darkness like a vermin they crawl
And still worse are discouraged souls
They kneel beyond the grave of the enemy

Cursed are all holy enemies
Who call themselves the chosen one
Now watch the frozen blood
Beyond the marble grave!

Time is right...
Time is now...
To kneel...
Beyond the grave of the enemy!Mother Tongue speaks to Me 
In the strongest way I've ever seen 
I know that she sees in Me 
Her proudest child, her purest breed 

She speaks to Me in colours 
That I can't really understand 
I only know that they are ours 
And to those I'll proudly bend 

For I am your only child 
And you my dearest mystery 
From an ancient throne I defy the world 
To kneel before the Power within. 

For I am your only child 
And you my dearest mystery 
World can't you see it? 
Am I alone in my belief?

It is the only way the Sea could sing 
Legends of Lusitanian pride 
He sings the words I cannot spring 

At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry 
Your lost glory we'll regain or die 

For I am her only child 
And she is my dearest mystery 
Pagan Gods in conspiracy 
For the sword of Tyranny 

Mother Tongue has spoke to thee 
In the strongest way they've ever seen

You have stepped through the door
Taken up the fight
To bring hope and bring light
Darkness has ensnared
The most steadfast souls
Down among the dead men
Trapped in a dark hole

Courage is waiting
To be brought into the realm
It waits for a champion
To bear it like a helm
Beyond the edge of fear lies strength, unyielding
Inside yourself
Victory is near, I stand strong, believing 
I stand strong, believing

You will overcome darkness
You will overcome fear

No longer on the floor
You have become so much more
Taken up the fight
To bring hope and burn bright

Courage is waiting
To be brought into the realm
It waits for a champion
To bear it like a helm
Beyond the edge of fear lies strength, unyielding
Inside yourself
Victory is near, I stand strong, believing 
I stand strong, believing

Every man will face darkness
Then they will see
That they hold the power within them
To become what they were born to be

You have overcome darkness
You have overcome fear
Look beyond the pain
And you will find grace
Look beyond the pain
And will find grace
Look beyond the pain
And you'll dream in space

Searching on your own
You have found the strength
Searching all alone
This is not your end
In shadow, stands a warrior
One, with courage, to slay all who bring fear
In shadow, stand hope's warriors
The blinders gone, purpose made clearHacked through the mauve gateway
Dryfting towards antimatter

In a diagonal freefall
My lungs collapse

Vile the sick stench of decay
Evil there is no other way(Instrumental)Demonic laughter your cremation
Your lungs gasp for air but are filled with blood

Deathcrush
DeathcrushI am the Alpha, the beginningHe strolled for the cold and arid coast 
There were not welcoming fiords, 
Only gigantic cliffs, 
Without other beings than seals, 
Birds and dark small men. 

He razed
-Avenger raven- 
Climbing the cliffs 
-Dead hands-. 
"Dead, dead". 
The draugr realized, 
But he didn't rest. 
Human weapons 
Damaged 
But not killed him
Traveled toward the north 
The memories arrived 
Returning of the death, 
Of many days of voyage, 
To the south of Vinland, 
Through the warm seas, 
Through the murderous sun, 
As having sent by Fenrir 
Over their drakkars. 

To the north, 
More barrows, 
Other fallen warriors. 
Resting in Valhalla. 

Resting in Valhalla.
He wanted to rest 
But he was a draugr. 
Now, a drakkar aground, 
Empty, without provisions. 
The memories arrived 
Returning of the death, 
Of many days of voyage, 
To the south of Vinland, 
Through the warm seas, 
Through the murderous sun, 
As having sent by Fenrir over their drakkars. 

And, as a draugr he was, 
He became seal, gull, 
Cat and fish. 
His hunger, appeased, 
Not his hate.
The memories arrived
Returning of the death, 
Of many days of voyage, 
To the south of Vinland, 
Through the warm seas, 
Through the murderous sun, 
As having sent by Fenrir 
Over their drakkars.For aeons linking the nine worlds 
the roots gave guidance to the lost souls 
under the witness of the eternal guard 
protecting the tree until the end, from the start 

A legion of branches surrounding the skies 
cage for all mortals, playground for gods 
the waters of life flow frozen to a spring 
colliding against fire from the flying wyrm 

Within the souls of valiant men 
there is a forge of prideful strength 
when the sky turns red upon the battlefield 
our cries break through beyond the steel 

With fear scattered in the hearts of the foe 
the barriers will fall like the autumn leaves 
the gods shall behold us with heavenly wonder 
as the bones of our enemies are torn asunder 

(CHORUS) 
And beneath the tree of life we fight 
beyond the sky we put our sight 
we'll cut the flesh and share the mead 
all for the heart of Yggdrasil 

(CHORUS x2)Awaken brothers of war, gaulish blood stains the shore. The legions have past the wall, they've come to destroy us all. Germania the tribes must unite, for family for honor we'll fight. Our swords will cut out their eyes, for Wotan our sacrifice. Mists hang low to the ground, hear the thunderclap sound. Scavenger birds take to flight, blood will be spilled this night. Single file, don't turn back. Generals guile, its a trap. Steel your hearts, charge ahead. Tear them apart, bloodshed.

Darkened woods come alive with barbarians, Centurions grip their shields in fear. Never again set foot in our northland, here we'll stand with ready axe and spear. Swords slice through thin flesh, stick in the bone. Axe hurled with great strength, pierced helm and skull. Spears glanced off their shields, impaling the throat.

Power! War drums sounding Louder! Sending out our battle cry.
Rome! Will never be his Home! He will reclaim his birthright.
Cowards! Now has come the Hour! For the end of tyranny.
Hermann! The mightiest German! By his virtue we are free.

Thunder! armies collide, forever their bodies will lye. Burdened by rain from black clouds, their armor sunk into the ground. Heathens both mighty and swift, from gods received this great gift. Surrounded like leaves legions fell, defeated their conquest was quelled. Vana commander and lord, in shame he fell on his sword. Those we do not slay, they will be enslaved. Single file, hear whips crack. Land defiled, no turning back. Feel our hearts, forever they beat. Honor the dead....Victory.The hell of my own corpse binding
Silver thread cut on ether wings drifting
The light and the night air tortured and blinding
The gift of a dark book unwinding

Pale form cools sleeping
Misery lingers forgotten wings fading
Lips press my fingers broken and bleeding
Your blasphemous prayers pleading

Withered petals fall
Velvet rain upon the floor
The tears that flow
You must let go

Pale form cools sleeping
Misery lingers forgotten wings fading
Lips press my fingers broken and bleeding
Your blasphemous prayers pleading

Withered petals fall
Velvet rain upon the floor

Pale form cools sleeping
Misery lingers forgotten wings fading(Instrumental)Hold your spears in the air
For everyone to see

Not one, not five,
Ten thousand gods will rise
Strong and proud
Mighty and loud
Bring back the times
When dragons would fly
Not one, not five,
Ten thousand stand, no one dies

Our cries are flying in the wind
Never fear the enemy

Not one, not five,
Ten thousand gods will rise
Strong and proud
Mighty and loud
Bring back the times
When dragons would fly
Not one, not five,
Ten thousand stand, no one dies

True bonds will not be broken
Let the wild hunt begin
Ten thousand
We are ten thousand gods
We have come this far
Fearless of tomorrow
Yesterday now lies far behind
Fearless and stronger each day

Hugin and munin are watching
As we become
Ten thousand
We are ten thousand gods
We have come this far
Fearless of tomorrow
Yesterday now lies far behind
Fearless and stronger as ten thousand godsThis is the voyage 
Prepare yourself for battle 
Set sail to plunder 
Time to rob the lands unknown 
Take what we want 
Leaving remains in flames 
Sailing the sea so fierce 
Only the strong will survive 
The wrath of the gods 
We take what is ours 
Returning to the land so cold 
Where all the forefathers lay 
Following the swords 
Riding the winds 
Watching the stars and moon 
To guide the voyage 
That many will not survive 
We left as strangers 
Only known by few 
We return as legends 
We are known by allI sit before the water and think
Of how the world would be
When water comes without life
As I have never seen
I sit before the water and think
Of people long ago
When I wish to see the world
As I have never seen beforeWhile we may believe 
our world - our reality 
to be that is - is but one 
manifestation of the essence 

Other planes lie beyond the reach 
of normal sense and common roads 
But they are no less real 
than what we see or touch or feel 

Denied by the blind church 
'cause these are not the words of God 
- the same God that burnt the 
knowingI carve the symbol on her forehead
Forced to drink the blood that is shed
Ripping inside the flesh 
Tearing the skin 
I can hear the call of death from within 

Slow breath of pain
Cry for Mercy 
chained to unholy grounds 
Birth of Fire 

Blade upon her mortality 
not a dream 
cleansing reality. 
Veins are cold, I see the last breath of Air 
Look inside her eyes 
I believe the lies. 

Lifeless Body 
Burial Awaits 
Open the gates

Lust for her cold body takes over 
I see the innocence of beauty 
I ravage, No longer see the lies 
Cemetery is longed 
As spirits and life go by 

Nocturnal wisdom has been seen 
for this is not a dream 
The would cannot heal 
This is not desire 
Selvmord! 
Birth of fire! 

My forest speaks.
I can hear the call 
of Death 
from within.(Instrumental)Cold are these towers
Those are surrounding us
We're still running
But the hunt is (over)
The buildings are pointed to the sky
But they have no soul
We may look to many directions
Whatever the place, we are lost

What have we made?
Constructions and gadgets for trade?
A possible warning for the very soul
We're working on our sacrifice's blade

Mouths are open, but they don't say a word
Ears that can't hear
Eyes that can't see
Modern accepted catatonia

A candle for you
A candle for me
Try harder...there's much to forbid
Three more candles,
Star of light
And now we have a good way to start!
Men are working
Works of flesh
No heart on today's schedule
The ritual
Never stops
But the line is still busy...

Nothing can stop
Our search for production
More, more, more
Nothing's sacred
Never enough
No time for that stuff, of course
Day after day
Daily routine
Rotting and pretending
Day after day
We rejoice
Glorious darkness ascending!

Much has changed... and life... how insistent dame!
Still walks on Earth, just to showoff her presence...

Waiting for us, the future fakes a smile
While our wishes become real
The void inside of every human heart
Claims for a sun that won't shine again!

Feelings now are frozen, no, it's not the moment
To cry...to hear...
Mankind is now astonished
For its own feats
Darker futile feats...

Much has changed... and life, how insistent dame!
Still walks on Earth, just to showoff her presence...

A cry lost in shadows
A puzzle of flesh
Glorious darkness
Our legacy of mourning...

Cold are these towers
Those are surrounding us
Mankind descending
Glorious darkness ascending(Instrumental)for too many years ago
I keep riding through barren lands and battlefields
along rusty leaves carried away by northern winds
to seek a glimmer of hope in my solitude
my grievous mind wanders the regretless
drowned within numberless haunting thoughts
despite frustration and treachery
my shadey soul stands up against sadness and despair.

I pray for those who were born in pain

I drink for those who once fell
I wish pest upon traitors and cowards
a rusted blade across each faithless heart.

chasing every single source of blooming
this heart of mine is free from all fire
in ruins I will leave my dull memory
I quit wobbling between sword and spear.

far beyond the place I was born and raised
I still remember the past I once left behind
where pints and cauldrons are still bottomless
where time stops as you sip god's beverage
which makes you forget the burden and solitude
which sweetens the bitter taste of blood.
fighting like a great warrior
doesn't make you a great man.(Instrumental)I'm the fist that smacked Mona Lisa's face
I'm the one that's gonna end the human race
I'm the fuck that's gonna make you scream in pain
I'm the reason that you'll never be the same

I'm the one that nailed Jesus to the wood
Not because I wanted, but because I could
I'm the poison that sent Snow White to die
I'm the nightmares that make you wanna cry


If you fuck with me I'll rip your soul apart
I'll find the reason then I'll stab you in the heart
I'm the creepy shadow you can never kill
Anyone can try but soon the blood will spill


I'm the sickness inside every killers mind
I'm the haunting feeling you can never find
I'm the bullshit you put up with in your life
I'm the evil fuck that causes all your strife

I'm the dementia that grows inside your brain
I'm the cancer that gives your grave a name
I'm the one that starts the wars because i should
I'm the fucking cunt that kills off all the good


If you fuck with me I'll rip your soul apart
I'll find the reason then I'll stab you in the heart
I'm the creepy shadow you can never kill
Anyone can try but soon the blood will spill

If you fuck with me I'll rip your soul apart
I'll find the reason then I'll stab you in the heart
I'm the creepy shadow you can never kill
Anyone can try but soon the blood will spill

Don't you ever wonder who the fuck I am
And why the fuck I never seem to give a damn
One day I'll appear and give you all a nod
And you'll realise, I'm fucking god(Instrumental)Donkere wolken pakken zich samen boven de torens van Lindisfarne.

For the future of world peace.
Go to certain death, to leave their homes, 
Ignoring hunger and disease.
Send people to defend the state, 
Stuffing their fat wallets more and more.

They thought they defended honor and dignity,
They wanted to create safety
End it all and find liberty.

Quietness and confidence in the future.

Forget about the war as a terrible dream!The lone scorching Sun observed the Earth,

Where volcanoes are breathing death,

And where death has plunged its sting

Nothing exists.

The fact or state of existing, or of being actual is a facade.
Life; the period during which someone or something exists is a made up fabrication.

Quite frankly, I do not care if either of us really are.
There was once a time that I did,
But that insignificant moment has passed just as any other significant memory fades.(Instrumental)Ravenous, as I reach, the mortals

Where are the trees? Where is the seed of life which allow all men to get along with nature?

Life-wave carrying the energies to fight the slave gods
New events prophetized by cycles of cosmic time
Divine awareness in mortal precipitation
Turns the axis-hail shivaite renovation

A black age unleashed to fullfill the cycle
Bear everywhere the forces of corruption
A black age unleashed with iron and fire

Subversion-opus novi ordinisGlorification of trash and megalomania
Talk shows and the world of color magazines
Distorted facts about the life of rich and famous
The subject of heated discussions
Among young ambitious girls
A display of disposable plastic beauty
Stupid trends of another season
The breadth of your views ends a few feet away
Your inner world is perfect mathematics
Your conduct is controled by money
You wont ever set your eyes on the skies in captivation
Because your eyes see just the emptiness
And the imagination woke you up
It's almost touching
Your ambitions and direction of your life in quotation marks
If you should spend a single
Day without your pseudoneeds
I guess they'd rush you to hospital
You're a great fuck but your company gets me tiredA new world has opened
A world among the stars
I have now found my star
And it will be my new home
Until the end of my stargate vision
Among the star I rest now
It's the time of silent
Only the sound of falling stars
Break the silent
Only in my dreams exist this world
It's just wonderful to hover
In the empty space
No feelings for humanity
A perfect world for me
I wish it last forever
This world made from depths
Of the darkest space of mind
Such vision of deathview
I search now for my death
And meet the shadow world(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The harmony we have with nature
Only be revealed with our silence
Nature speaks to us all the time
Only with our silence we can hear it

Listen the sound of silence
Listen their thoughts
Listen the sound of the birds
Listen the wind blowing the trees

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Feel the wind in your face
Listen to nature talking to you

Our ancestors taught us the silence
One who follows this teaching
Will be in harmony with nature
In your heart

Listen the sound of silence
Listen their thoughts
Listen the sounds of the birds
Listen the wind blowing the trees

Lyrics by IpseBeyond the mountains
where the wind cries out its pain
Deserted valleys
where the darkness always reigned

Where the sunlight never ever
touched the poisoned ground
Where the laugh of undead children
never ever sound

Forever wrapped in darkness
the forgotten valleys of Hades

Forgotten damned domains
where curse and hate collide
Where the cold and darkness meet
and the truth have turned to lie

Where the flame of love growls cold
and its powers never rise
And hand of death has grasped
every form of light

Forever wrapped in darkness
the forgotten valleys of HadesFrom wasted land I wended my way to north 
From empty life to wisdom and rebirth; 

"And far beyond the glacier, 
At the edge of world - 
I will find my own domain 
Of eternal cold." 

I rot in chaos of the dead hope's halls 
In endless noise among the grey stone walls; 

"But far beyond the glacier, 
At the edge of world - 
I will find my own domain 
Of eternal cold." 

In every dream 
I see that gleam, 
I follow frozen path; 
And watch the sign 
In northern sky... 

"As I behold that frozen land below 
And see that endless cemetery of souls - 
I feel the ice, that chained their rotten minds; 
Not all can reach the heart of glacier..."Out of the water
The cold, black Nordic Sea..
Glistens towards eternal sky
The land lays open and free...
Up high, the mountains
Where the wind catches speed and chill
Snow storms are born
And rage loud through the valleys and hills...

Above, two ravens, messengers
Of the wise one eyed God
Who rules this land
Of the strong and the brave
And tall, beautiful
Behold this, thy land
Open and free
This, thy home of once brave...

Dark endless forests
Where a day has the shadows of night..
Snow covered wastelands
As grey as the eternal sky...
Now in the midst
Of this wild, this open and free
He placed my kind
To possess this, their land to be...

Above, two ravens, messengers
Of the wise one eyed God
Who rules this land
Of the strong and the brave
But now forgetting
To behold this, thy land
Once ours, once free
This, thy home of once brave....Marshes of dead marauders
Millions of bones - rotting lands
Winds of sulphur
Sunless, moonless
Out of time, static world
Dawn or dusk - who knows?
No where to go
No start nor end
No clear water, nor pure air
Grey sky
Slimy rain of dust and ashes
Spirals of madness
Eternally lost in space
Caught by a black mouth
endless fall, endless hole
Destruction
This is future
Chaos is here
This is the end
Mankind is working

Lands of sadness
Dying pace after pace
Dust in the infinite space
Running to reach the total death
Destruction
This is future
Chaos is here
This is the end
Mankind is working
Marshes of dead marauders
Millions of bones - rotting lands

Slimy rain of dust and ashes

Lies the Winter Queen
In white gome she comes to my house at night
She's my only dream

I'll do anything she ordered to me
But I cannot come with her
Only souls of death are her closest friends
In the endless cold

Door is open come inside
Lights are off
Be my bride

Darkest feelings came inside
Bloody tears flow when I cry
The only way out is the suicide
Only way out - suicideGolden scythe, mistletoe
Hallowed oak, from sacred grove
Mouldering bones, ravens fly
Andraste, Queen of war!
Fallen foe, yonder blaze.

Hueless wraiths, banshee wails
Bitter ash, the last Samhain
The age of Nero is upon us!

Oh, the White Goddess within me
Dreamless sleep!
Oh, the White Goddess that is within me.
Oh, the White Goddess within me
Dreamless sleep!
Oh, the White Goddess that is within me.

I am the dark of the moon,
The cutter of threads,
I am the one to whom all return,
I am the stag, the wind on the lake,
I am the solar priest
With dread unwreathed,
I am the phantom pale,
And the grim embrace of clay,
I am the hunger, I am the dark.The Winter has come 
the forst is freezing our hearts

the snow it turns all white 
and neverending darkness
reigns 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky

remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their
battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

When the
winter of their return 
brings the ancient spirit back

when their battlecry is heard 
we will rise again


The woods have become white 
the frost has turned
the seas to ice 
our mighty pagan land 
it is lying dark
there under the wintermoonlight 

...under the
wintermoonlight 

When the fullmoon is to see on the sky

remember our warriors who died 
when you hear their
battlecry 
we will fight side by side 

By the
wintermoonlight 
we rise again 

The Winter has come

the forst is freezing our hearts 
the snow it turns all
white 
and neverending darkness reigns 

When the
fullmoon is to see on the sky 
remember our warriors who
died 
when you hear their battlecry 
we will fight side
by side 

When the winter of their return 
brings
the ancient spirit back 
when their battlecry is heard

we will rise again 

...again... 
...we will
rise again...My face is covered by
A mask that shows no failing
But my will is broken
The blossom has decayed

A last time I...
A last time I have to endure this pain

Pure beauty can only exist
In realtion to decease

Tears running down the face
While I stare into darkness
Possessed by the idea
To die a last time

A last time I close my eyes
A last time I have to feel this pain
I let myself fall...

Pictures of my life passing by
The spirit disunites with it's bodyCold I lie, all life drained 
My life I gave for my king 
Skilled - yet i failed. I then prey 

What was once was will never be 
My life of old has passed 
Obscure my being, a tragedy 
In solitude I roam 
The forest king, the raging one 
Herne I'm called 
'Tween the worlds, not man not ghost 
For eternity bound to ride 

You will breathe and live 
Your skill, your prowess I claim 
For your life(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Dark shadows in my mind
I can see but I'm blind
No power left to fight
Heart stops beating right

I feel like living dead
Lost all joy only sad
Gone away is all the hope
Covered under a black cloak

The day before the sun is dying
Reality is lost in a never-ending stream
The day when the sun is dying
I watch it like in one last dream

No fear just resignation
waiting for the end
Desperation disillusion
No light at tunnel's end

Forgotten is my desire
Burned by a cold fire
I hunt my dying soul
That hides behind a growl

Fate gives me a demonstration
I can't find salvation
My thoughts melt in the sea
There is nothing left of me

The day before the sun is dying
Reality lost in a never-ending stream
The day when the sun is dying
I watch it like in one last dream(Instrumental)Wild galloping horses,
on green
vast sunny meadows.
Lakes in harmony
with the skies: pale blue

Forest, peaceful and proud
Trees, ancient
and hundred metres tall

Wild galloping horses,
on green
vast sunny meadows.
Lakes in harmony
with the skies: pale blue

Forest, peaceful and proud
Trees, ancient
and thousand years old(Instrumental)Last Line Of Defense 


Grandfather, grandfather tell me stories
Of your great grandfathers heroics and glory
Tell me the tales and I'll never forget
Their hardships, their struggles, I'll follow in their steps

The story begins many years ago
Across the oceans in a place we call home
Our peaceful land was invaded from the south
Hordes of Muslims tried to drive us out

In this war many brave men died
Villages burned as the children cried
The defenders of Vienna were put to the test
They were the last line of defense

Grandfather, grandfather tell me a story
Of your father on the fields of glory
Tell me of a boy that became a man
When he answered the call of his Fatherland 

Trenches and barbed wire was all to be seen
It was baptism of fire in 1916
Explosions ripped craters in the ground
His unit was pounded round after round

With his bayonet fixed to his gun
He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen the sun
On the Somme, Verdun, he'd seen so much death
Now he was the last line of defense

Grandfather tell me a story
Of 1933-the power-the glory
Tell me what it was like being the best
Defending the pearl of the West

The beauty, the grandeur, was a sight to behold
A nation reborn, rebuilt from the old
The heart of the nation was beating so strong
Yet we knew of the dangers, and it wouldn't be long

We fought in the south, the west, east and the north
Against the whole world we would set forth
To protect an ideal and a culture so true
We were the last line of defense

We fought in the south, the west, east and the north
Against the whole world we would set forth
To protect an ideal and a culture so true
We were the last line of defenseFreezing winds are summoning raging gales 
as a traveler timelessly wanders 
lost in the storm he meets the end 
an ancient curse for every mortal 

A desperate cry resounds on the hills 
as the trees sway furiously 
blindly seeking meets her gaze 
impaling him right through the heart 

(CHORUS) 
And there she stands, 
dressed in ice and shadows, 
the lady of frost is waiting 
to embrace the eternal night... of cold! 

At the fall of dusk no light remains 
and all hope is forgotten 
no creed nor faith shall now reject 
the only and dismal fate 

Her aura feeds the frozen souls 
and withers life away 
within the eternal flames of hell 
shall lie relieving death 

(CHORUS x2)(Instrumental)(lyrics: Ion)

Eyes of the Thousands in My eyes
I see no men but only slaves
I see no men but only doomed
I see no men but living dead

Voices of the Thousands in My speech
I scream no words but only pray
I scream no words but only sneer
I scream no words but only curse

I turn into the Beast
I turn into the God
See My Greateness 
See My wildest elation

I subsist since a human being arose from ashes.
In My essence lurked all secrets of creation.
I am the shade of every being
I am the Law incarnation.

What will be the world without any shadow?
What will be the Man without his true nature?

Envy Me!!!
Join Me!!!

Wisdom of the Thousands in My mind
I muse no thoughts but only hate
I muse no thoughts but blasphemy
I muse no thoughts but dreams of blood(Instrumental)Decaying hawks howling in the nest
Surrounded by bramble stems
Thorns slashing like tongues made of glass
Feeling the smell of the approaching sun
Will your grand feathers for ever remain?

Specters rising from underneath
Mirrored in the watery air
Out of the burning manorhouses
They spread like venereal disease

Manimals caught in the nest of thorns
Universal abandon, self-slaughter,
In the nest of despair your domain's soul
Is no longer your, and never will be.

Specters rising from underneath
Mirrored in the watery air
Out of the burning manorhouses
They spread like venereal disease
Shattered dreams, blessed earnings,
Scars bron from bleeding stars

Rhythms of doom, Reptiles in gloom,
Baptized in holy sewage,
Spread like venereal disease
Shattered dreams, blessed yearnings,
Scars born from bleeding stars(Instrumental)THIS DEATHGRIP HAS TAKEN IT'S TOLL ON US 
WHERE DO WE GO NOW 
IT'S ALL UP IN YOUR MIND AND CLOUDING YOUR FACE 

YOU CAN TALK, BUT NOBODY'S LISTENING 
NOWHERE TO HIDE 

DEATH GRIPS, DEATH LIES 
NOWHERE TO HIDE 
DEATH GRIPS AND DEATH LIES, YEAH 

THIS IS AN EVERYDAY STRUGGLE IN THE CHAOS WE CALL LIFE 
NOT JUST BIG MONEY WAR SHIT OR BIG MONEY LIES 

YOU CAN TALK, BUT NOBODY'S LISTENING 
NOWHERE TO HIDEAs the moon grows to its completeness
I pray to gods of old
On the mighty hill I stand
Resurrecting the world
In the shine of the north star
Where heaven meets the earth and hell
Imitation of the act of gods
Fire, noise, screams shall prevail

Darkness grows deeper as the aeon declines
Return of the dead, soon a new morning shall rise
Hopefully looking back at the authentic time
Resurrection of free will, there our origin lies
Darkness grows deeper as the aeon declines
Return of the dead, soon a new morning shall rise
History's revocation reminds the golden age
Cosmos conflagration, return to the myth

I pray to gods of old
Resurrecting the world
Where heaven meets the earth and hell
Unfettered dance shall prevail

As the blooms wither these days
Our strength grows immensely high
Return to the golden age
Imitation of the archetypes
Nothing can last, what's not brought back to life
Cosmic image shining bright
Sacred moment with sacred vibe
Repeated beginning of our time

Black Wings of Death
The churchbell of doom is tolling
The angel of death is near
The ghost with cowl and the sickle
Spreading terror and fear

He's taking your breath,
He's twisting your spine
He poisons your soul and
He poisons your mind

Grim reaper will gather in his seed
Blood will splatter his path
A phantom that's sealing your doom
The damned's foreboding of death

He's taking your breath,
He's twisting your spine
He poisons your soul and
He poisons your mind

Riding high on the black wings of death
Like a nightmare that choking your breath
Like the terror that blackens your soul
It's the dream where you fall on a six foot deep hole

The dice of life are falling
The weak and the poor will lose
The rich in their ivory towers
Can't feel that their head's in the noose
No chance to talk him round
The black death is spreading its wings
He's the Jonah of unbridled fear
The pain to beggars and kings

He's taking your breath,
He's twisting your spine
He poisons your soul and
He poisons your mind

Riding high on the black wings of death
Like a nightmare that choking your breath
Like the terror that blackens your soul
It's the dream where you fall on a six foot deep hole

Riding high on the black wings of death
Like a nightmare that choking your breath
Like the terror that blackens your soul
It's the dream where you fall on a six foot deep holeEndlessly... I seek the truth
Finding the secrets of my ancestors

I walk into the forest and the winds howl my name 
Gods! Guide my path to the wisdom
(to the sacred tree i give my holiest gifts)

...wisdom opens the gates for the king...Who would've thought you'd carve out a place
Writing run-of-the-mill adventures of Ace?
Like Seven from the Stars and The Door Through Space
Darkover and over and over
You pick up the pen Marion or a friend
Darkover's colonists were once human
Developed psionics is the interim
To retell Brittian's mythic origin
Masculine to Feminine L'Femme D'Morgan
Darkover and over and over and over again!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I gaze at the stars
by the great dying oak,
to the realm of the gods
I am no longer lost

in the gathering of night
on raven wings I glide
to the three far worlds
of land sea and sky.

the ancient white owl
and voices from the wells
of sun, moon and  stars
The ergot- trance -tells

in  soothless disdain,
in the cauldron of Awen
adder stones awaken
and dream weaver thread


In the chamber of the grave
I must soon take my leave
I am the last of my kind
and who would believe

of the great lord Arthur
the dark Avalon wolf
who fought and was slain
enchanted to the end

Bewitched by the lake
of dusk coated raven,
by the grove of tall oaks
and viper shaman
to ride on the black  swan,
to the tor of Avalon
to rest above all men
great dragon of Albion.Clumps hang
on branches of withered trees
Homage paid to the medieval hell
on infinite,muddy lands.
The sight of holy crosses
standing among the dead
they became the messengers of Christian destruction

The Creator is dead for them
turning towards Satan
with their prayers and woes
Stream,death grunt,
crackle of fire
dead bonfires.
The medieval hell
shown by the Christian

Behold the sign on the black goat
whiplash a new nation together

Behold the red moon on the sky
for the sun has already slept away

Let the Armageddon come
this earthly race has been extincted and God is dead as well.(Instrumental)Nasty memories bring me back
where my first dreams were born
For my thousand of parents
I've always been just a thorn
Nuns and preachers were hitting me
when I was laughing loud
Always teaching me the rules
Chorus:
I'm your master bow your head
I'm the blaster all brains to a blend
I'm your master bow your head
I'm disaster feel the dread
In this wild world a boy speaking less
than he understands
And the countless obstructions of life,
fallen by your hands.
Leave the sobers behind
cause they've never been floating high
Always crawling to the groundDeserted house of morbid death
Chopped up bones and rotting flesh
All that enter will be killed
Cleaver splits your head in two

Grinding up flesh
Blood splattered death

Corpses hang from sharp tell hooks
Gutted, skinned, prepared to cook
Deranged fuck squashes your head
Laughing while you writhe in death

Hacking off limbs
Screaming victimsSpopod hustin , spomienkou davnou
na prahu noci, v srdci mociarov..

Moans beneath the pentagram, fuelling the spirit of the ritual
Shivers hanging from the cross
Blood streaming from the signs on your chest

Possessive hands coming forth from the night
Strapped before the signs of Hell

You're shivering, goose bumped shivering

Split your legs apart, riding the thorns, eyes white rolling in possession
For the shadow you shall spread, pulled to the horned, forcing penetration

Horned for the beast, for me the path growing stronger

Choke hold victory... choke hold victory...

Gasping in the night, fulfillment, stabbed by the horns

Screams beneath the pentagram, stabbed by the horns
Screams beneath the pentagram, hanging upon the inverted cross

Raw mercy laid down, occult madness and rituals
Goring glory rising the dead, mirroring future in my eyes

You're shivering, no escaping the spells, your shivering is the pleasure

Choke hold victory... choke hold victory...(Instrumental)Stan,Aethelstan, are you ready?
Bring your shields now!
You'll take the stakes,
and hold the left wing.
Cedric,Oswiu, are you ready?
Bring your shields now!
You'll take the stakes,
and hold the right wing!

This is a wall,
and no one cross the wall!
This is a wall,
and no one cross the wall!
 
This is a day of grey omens,
light breezes and rain.
Stroking our cheeks,
like a maid's sweet eyelash.
Black battle corpse in the field,
wakes us up from that.
Daydreaming,
about Saxon whoring.

This is a wall,
and no one passes it.
Our lives flash,
before us guarding it.

Come and fight.I am ready,
to defend my girl,
and the seeds,
of me in her womb.
If this is the day,
it is perfect.
I might die for her,
but I'd rather make them die for their girls.

This is a wall,
and no one cross the wall!
This is England.
No one crosses the wall!ojgniew- son of Slavia

Burns a magic fire on the shores of river Nile
Guardian of the secrets of the pyramids
Pharaohs and Queens, they rest in ancient crypts 
Protected by the spells of evil priests 

Spins the wheel of time, towards the Enlightenment
The bright age of discoveries and wars
Conquerors of Egypt, Napoleonic troops
Plundering the land taken by storm
Explorers through the mist of reigns unknown

Gods, men and demons and beasts with powers divine
The final frontiers, are ruled and sealed by Horus hawkeyes
Sandstorms rise from the desert, a kingdom too proud to be tamed
The vengeance will strike, the jackals of night will howl once again

Torches cast their firelight on mystic glyphs of old
Hammer smashes royal chamber's walls
Violators brutalize and profanate with no remorse
Soon they will be stricken by the curse

Winged is the fly that bites when cowards fall asleep
Silent is the cobra, lethal venom on its teeth
Deadly pointed scorpion tails, nail victims to the ground
Legions of the dark are on the prowl
Children of the sand will hunt you down

Gods, men and demons and beasts with powers divine
The final frontiers, are ruled and sealed by Horus hawkeyes
Sandstorms rise from the desert, a kingdom too proud to be tamed
The vengeance will strike, the jackals of night will howl once again

This is not a legend , but a page of history
Still the fire burns, this land to keep
Scavengers of human lust for glory and for gold
Don't cross again the point of no return
Powers of the Nile will steal your soul

Gods, men and demons and beasts with powers divine
The final frontiers, are ruled and sealed by Horus hawkeyes
Sandstorms rise from the desert, a kingdom too proud to be tamed
The vengeance will strike, the jackals of night will howl once again

Rises from the horizon, the majestic fire of the sun
Its challenging light reflects on the Nile, bringing new life
Caravans across the desert, nomads and tribes they all know
Forces of Egypt will serve and protect the secrets of old(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Universe

From all that was, it will be

The twilight of the time and universe
The complexity cosmic
The roots of the from all
The roots of the tree universal

All are in here, all are in there
Universal laws never broken
Life and death
Light and darkness

Grandeur of existence

All are in here, all are in there
Universal laws never broken
Life and death
Light and darkness

Lyrics by IpseCome the Golden Age
Two great halls under the Sun
Most wondrous of all things
Twelve great thrones to be with the One
Mighty seats of judgement
In the gilded hall

Build now great forges of fire
Hammer, tong and anvil
To forge all other tools
Work with metal, stone and wood
Vast hoards of gold
Golden houses rise

Upon their thrones of judgement,
Above the living earth,
Maggots finding life in flesh,
Will be granted their birth
Gaining the likeness of men
Knowledge and understanding
Dwelling deep inside the ground
Modsognir and Durin's kin

(The Sibyl's Prohepcy : 11-16)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Please let us give you a welcome 
you are at the Beerbath Bar 
we drench your throat and fill your belly 
while the lasses get you warm 

Inside the feast is getting heated 
get close and choose your spot 
ales are flowing, meat is roasting 
fellows, this night will be everlasting! 

A giant barrel full of beer lies upon our heads 
hours go by and golden jars feed our entrails 
the gates knock down and foes are storming in 
they have signed a contract for our butchery 

Drunkenness is our weapon for this siege 
our brothers have gone berserk 
someone cut the ropes of the barrel in the ceiling 
and all the hall is swimming in beer 

We throw the tables off then grab our swords 
flesh comes apart like sand 
we're witnesses of bloody glory 
and will rejoice on gods' delight 

Now they call it the Beer Bloodbath! 
That night was called the Beer Bloodbath! 
Now they call it the Beer Bloodbath! 
That night was called the Beer Bloodbath!When you reach the peak of the mountain You look at the field in front of you There stands thousands of men waiting for their chance to kill you You prepare yourself for the battle to come As does the men around you The battle begins as you swing your sword The army of men begin to charge forward All around you men take their last breath as the sword strikes their head Their everlasting demise has just begun after their last breath cut short When you reach the peak of the mountain You look down in front of you Bodies lay all around These are the casualties of war You honor these men who have fought beside you THey have come to win but couldn't see the end for their lives have been cut short by the enemies sword.(Instrumental)Race of Noble Conquerors

From ages Their carry sword of Swarg
Leaving behind them the blaze, wild fear
Winners in hundred battles and skirmishes
Power and Glory of cruel White Gods
Flaming desire of rule and conquest
We invade and crush any strike 
Earth belongs only to tough warriors
Blood of  defeated army is spalshing everywhere
Hear noises of taken slaves
Defeateds are groaning in pain under our feets
Fanfares for fearless wolfs
Always ready to fight and crush
Our homestead is bloody battlefield
Guts are banner of our enemies
In shine of radiant invincible Sun
We taking delight of bestial murder
In rhythm of drums of war  
We roaring triumphant 
 Like wolfs at winter time to new moonNow I understand why I had to suffer
A preparation of what will come
I solved the enigma of life
And will lead them the way to aeon

I survived the ordeal
My burden shall be my strength
Flowing tears turn into ice
While I rise from the dust

Now I understand why I had to suffer
A preparation of what will come
I solved the enigma of life
And will lead them the way to aeon
I will resist the temptation
I will fullfill every demand

You'll find out what's left inside
...Of this soul
Don't forget who you are
Who you were

Now I understand why I had to suffer
A preparation of what will come

the Plague stands close to you
the Plague dictates your Way
the Plague means to decay

Pride of the nation, bulwark of peddlers 
Cool morning of yet another business week

Powers threatening
With inevitable devastation
Will efface
Their primeval fear.(Instrumental)In a time when children sing
of magic, lords and rings
As the eagle spreads its wings
We rise

When ancient empires fight
Steel gleams across the night
Hyborian kings, conquest and might

Breed of Atlantean kings
Masters of the sword
Rulers from the East
Hyrkanian Blades

With mace and chains we'll grind
the tyrants of mankind
Civilization's just a dream
conceived in Erlik's eyes

Where thrones are shining bright
like jewels under the sky
On roads with jade and amber paved
We will ride

Rising from lemurian ashes
Riding savage steeds of war
Flashing Steel's their only answer
Rulers from the East
Hyrkanians

The living Tarim knows
What Skelos once foresaw
A mighty flood will sweep anew
The savage plains we roam

Black steeds of war will ride
Across the steppes that night
With flashing axe and deadly sword
To storm the gates of time(Instrumental)Silence and abstinence
I'm a naked scientist
In front of the gates
To the outer world

This is not the right time
But across the aeons
Your presence
Answers my hopes
From hidden paths
Victory is bestowed
I pay my debt
With immortal sounds
Across the aeons
Your unborn smileDivided by visions of old days goneby
Admitting those echoes inside my mind

I'm left in a dark and shadowed shroud
Unsafe from darkness's grasp
A darkness which blanks my mind,
Fueled by the shame and contempt

These rays of light
Visions of old days
Are passing me by

I finally found the way throughout the maze, 
I finally found the way throughout the haze

Bound to the shameful past

A frightful sight ahead of time
I see an Ocean of sadness
In a vision of old days gone by
One step ahead of the madness

These rays of light
Visions of old days
Are passing me by

I finally found the way throughout the maze, 
I finally found the way throughout the haze
Never seen the light of dayCrows sing
They are messages
Of warriors killed in battle
The silence we hear clearly
It is the voice that indicates the correct path
No place for the return of the burning times
But the new times lurk
The silence we hear clearly
It is the voice that indicates the correct path
No place for the return of the burning times
But the new times lurk
For with death
There will be a new beginning
A new battle being waged
There will be a new beginning
A new battle being waged
And the crows sing
Oftentimes
For with death
There will be a new beginning
The silence we hear clearly
It is the voice that indicates the correct path
No place for the return of the burning times
But the new times lurk
For with death
There will be a new beginning
Dying is always unfinished
The return of the burning times...
Around campfires to the sound of drums
We call the maiden and crone nature
Cult of horned god and I walk with him about heaven...
The magic in water and earth, fire and air
I am a child of the great spirit
I am a fragment and at the same time the whole nature
I am the one who dies every little deaths, the experience of the sacred...
For with death
There will be a new beginning
Dying is always unfinished
I am the one who dies every little deaths...
Crows sing...they are messages

...
For with death
There will be a new beginning
A new battle being wagedEs ist nicht Tag
Und auch nicht Nacht
Nichts war
Und nichts wird sein
Kalte Sonne - ohne Strahl
Der Himmel ohne SternThese dark pagan forests,
have been long forgotten,
Dead trees stand erect
they're withering away into Oblivion,
This once lush realm
now completely dead
and absent of life,
For these memories
died with the ancient ones,
Died in my childhood,
Tales of our home...
now cease to exist,
Those forests-damned
by the darkest black
birthing of the pagan fears,
Ransacked by forces unknown,
Ancestral spirits habit arcane lands,
Leaves burning in purest Autumn fire,
blaze the northern funeral sky,
Primeval Memories of Forgotten Forests
They now only exist
among the taint to the dying earth,
Black scorched bark
once foretold our destiny,
Like forests of life aeons past
all will suffer a similar fate,
Primeval Memories of Forgotten Forests,
Primeval Memories-
Forgotten-
Forests,



(All Lyrics are propert of Ravenhelm/munnin)To wait is worse than the earth consolation
There's no way to live
The death will arrive and with a kiss of angel
Bring a tear

Trusting your dreams
We get near the clouds
And stars will disappear

Any word stop the firmaments sing
You will never come back

Words are like fire
Infinite colours unmove me
Tell me why the walls are closer everytime
The line between two worlds is narrower

Reality, my life without you
Necessity, hear you one more time
Melancholy, in my heart
Fear, to can't resist

The clock will come back behind
Where ever we were together
I can't forget it

Frezze wind has taken your scent
In the air, just I can breath fear

Let me die, near to you

When the falcon undetakes it's last flight
The endless quietness of death's gallery
Find in her, the unavoidable fateI erected my temple in blood, shade and speculation
A monument to the prideless tantalism
Of those who never dared

I'm yours
Cognitive dissonance
The apostle of a triumphant Nefas

Choose hierarchy
Choose a path
To serve or to resurrect

Spare me for today
The chronicles of compassion
Be forged in subversion

I'm the blasphemy of your Nirvana
Extolling the fierce grin
Of faustian hubris
An avatar for enslaved initiations

Walk on fire
Soar into the gate
The void has become 
A black diamondDarkified mist runs over the land
I lie down with my face in the sand
The sun or the truth I cannot see
My soul is lost and will forever be
But suddendly I see a striking fight
The blackened mist turns whiter than white

A blue-red fire burns the illness around me
The Pagan land burns as far as I can see
No living but I can see the light
It screams to me: stand and fight
Take your sword and save your blood
You will fight alone, there was never a god

My body thrills as I stand the dark
The goldfish in my has never become a shark
The fire is gone but I still burn
Finally I can see so I start to run
The darkified mist seems to fear
The hate and the pain I can bear

A whisper I say becomes a shout, "Pay for my
blood" screams the mist very loud
The earth will burn when I''ll arrive
I am dignant of the light, my will is alive
Rewinning my soul is what I will do
I kill without remorse, I have a memory too!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Oh, mighty lord of the evil realm
Open the gates to your dominion
Save me from this holy light
That makes me suffer like a pig
Satan lead me to your throne
And make me one with hell
I kneel before you dark lord
And swear the unholy oath
Unholy master Satan - make my wish come true

Open wide your kingdom-where all the evil rule
Lord of hell possess my soul
With thousand mad and insane demons
Lock up, the seven gates
And bring out your infernal legions

Lucifer - lead me to your throne
Satan - bless my damned soul
Belial - baptize me in blood
Leviathan - take me to the depths

Open the gates - Satan
Open the gates - Satan
Open the gates - Satan
Open the gates - Satan

Master-cast your spell on earth
Curse the waek disciples, their holy soul must burn
Lord of fire - consume the holy lord
Your black flame of damnation shall purify the world

Lucifer - let the cursed soul burn
Satan - make fire consume the world
Belial - sacrifice thy holy blood
Leviathan - show their lord your wrath

Open the gates - Satan
Open the gates - Satan
Open the gates - Satan
Open the gates - SatanCome wind, by my side.
My sin... why I ride ?

We're running over hills,
storming through deep woods,
we are using ancient skills...

...Running out of rules!

Searching nature round... we're looking down the hill,
Watching rays of light, a triumph of the will.

Grey skin of the land...
cold wind, flying sand...

Howling hordes of wolves
chilling waves of light,
it's the calm before the fight!

Searching nature round... we're looking down the hill,
Watching rays of light, a triumph of the will(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Where blow cold winds
 Embracin' mountain tops
 Where rivers flow into seas
 I dragin' alone 
 
 Emotions transpire
 Shadows above
 Voices are whisperin' me
 Tears from my eyes 
 
 Struggle with no one
 Nothing to lose
 Dawn succeed the sunset
 Day turns into night 
 
 Summon attracts me
 I walk to eternity
 Grief my fellow-traveller
 Forgotten past 
 
 That's what I need is
 That's what I searching for
 Everything else to nowhere 
 
 No return from the wasteland
 Forever
 Take me away
 By the path of frustration
 Soon I'll be thereIn my dreams
I'll touch the sky
In my screams
Thousands of wolves cry
I'm over time
Burn day to night

[Chorus:]
Rain and snows in my left hand
Thunders and lightings in my right hand
Stars in my eyes
Sun in my crowm
I rule the winds
Am I God?

Strongest rain
Cleans the face of Earth
Falling snows
Dress her in white clothes
I'll take your life
You'd soil the light

[Chorus:]
Fires of spring
Blast of green
Black summer night
Silence and pride
Stars in my eyes
Sun in my crown
I'll kill mankind
Am I God?(Instrumental)... And the world was young. And it was cruel and beautiful.
And it was full of heroes and titans who were fighting and
cognizing the world.
In that time people souls were nalve and child-like
happily. People saw life in everything and the surrounding
nature meant for them something what not everybody living
now can understand. And thay believe in Gods who were
different in names but same in essence. Those Gods came
to the Earth from the old ages, when all living was dark and
cruel and lifeless - light and reconciling. In those ages
intellect did not exist and its place was occupied by instinct -
a formidable weapon, leading to death... Monsters
possessed this weapon, whose horror was later called Hell,
and there was no a single creature who had not spent their
life in struggle for everything.
When the Gods descended on the Eartg and saw that
savage chaos they were puzzled and horrified by the
scenery. And so they created the first people, who got three
things really majestic - intellect, wisdom and feelings. And
every God had the telns of government of a soul, and the
Gods of darkness gave evil genius to intellect, misanthropy
to wisdom and hatred to feelings; and the Gods of light gave
clearness of thought to intellect, kindness to wisdom and
love to feelings. And people, having opened their eyes, saw
the fear of life and prayed for remorse and salvation,
because man is weak, and God is omnipotent. So the Gods
saved the people from the savage chaos and peace and light
started reigning.
But Evil retired to darkness awaiting for the reveal and
began to send grief and pain; suffering enfered the even
part of intellect and started to destroy the people from
Inside. Darkness moved to light and wars, murders
and depravity descended on the humankind. Brothers killed
brothers and the war was not between people but between
Gods, who wanted to make the world more perfect. But the
Gods of light forgot that there was no light without shadows,
and their opponents that there was no use in darkness
without light.
So, the Gods become reconciled, for continuation of the
struggle had no sense and has a sign of the reconcilation they
built a TOWER on the border of Light and Dark, human's
world and divine world. And people's life was happy and
calm and it was the Golden Age!
But among the Gods there was one the smallest and
contemptible one, longing for power. So, he deceived
the Gods of Evil and got the wine, which the Gods of Death
gave to the people when their time was out. They drank it
and fell into sleep when the Gods had a feast he poured that
wine into their goblets. And having done it, he said: "From
now on you are heresy and I am the God!" His name was
Iegova and he called himself God. For the true, Immortal
Gods had fallen asleep and only the Gods of Darkness stayed
awake and for this reason Iegova begane to detest them and
drove them out of TOWER. And this nonentity made heaven
his throne and started ruling the visible world, and the Gods of
Darkness ruled the Invisible world because Iegove was not a
true God, but a false one. And people don't believe him and
then he sent them his reflection, called Christ, to mislead the
humankind, relying upon their naivity and simplicity. Christ,
being lead by his forefather, told people tales and showed
wonders, although they were very stupid, comparing with what
true Gods, sleeping in the TOWER, could do. But people were
surprised and praised Christ like children and soon commited
the truth of ancient for oblivion and fire, for they believed the
divine mongrel. And the plague of deception and deafness
spread all over the world and people went mad.
And the TOWER, standing on the crossing of Darkness and
Light, Life and Death gradually was overrun with moss and
seeds and plunged in the lack of faith...
And nobody from the living now knows the truth and true
ancient Gods are sleeping in the TOWER, awaiting for the
prophecy, drawn with rules at the gates, to come true: "and in
nineth night the moon will disappear, moons will show and
omens of each of us will be burning on them, because people
will recollect and believe and the truth will awake through that
faith. And he, once having lied, will be overthrown and cursed.
And the world'll see its rebirth from the ashes and the Golden
Age will come again."
And I had this vision and having learnt the truth, I praised the
sleeping abd cursed the staying awake, because until the false
god is in heaven, grains of Truth are dispersed in darkness and
they are countless in number and light is only pure imagination.
Let your time come, the Gods, true and ancient, who's given
us life and death, light and darkness, intellect, wisdom and
feelings...

Cursed son of Hurin
Crossed the mountains of shadow

Out of the land of Doriath
He followed the ancestors call

The eternal darkness
Carry me through the darkest kingdom,
Through your infernal flames,
Into your realms of hell!

By Satan give me strength!
By Lucifer give me fire!

Watch my strength grow, as I get crowned as Prince of Darkness
Drink my blood, and become one of me.
MASTER, HAIL ME!!There's really nothing in this world I would crave for
The fears and my nightmares are becoming real 
more and more
Every glance I take is of pure winter
And every little rose is black in the heart of mine.

Angel stabbed with the fearless bravado...

Once I risked scary wink to somebody
Dealt out the cards of threat to society.
Ones that dwell in this bale of calamity
Forced to feed mouths of lie with absurdity.

Life's but a dream...

One second paranoia, disappointment
Sinister dialetics, despondency
Lamentable living standards, disdain
Responsibility - diminished

Sitting in the room of no fraternity
Contemplating in NDE
I observe the kaleidoscope
Of twisted human eugenics

Psychical hermitage
Born of vital exhaustion
I drink from the bowl of abhoration
To greet another fascination

No call o' mine shall on these wastelands recognized be
On deserts pulsating not

From abandoned grave
Am I ever to escape?
My blood has run out
Never I am to awakeIm Schattenlicht, zwischen den Welten

Im Schattenlicht, zwischen den Welten, wartend...
Meine Sinne gerichtet auf all das Leben, fern von euch,
welches ihr nicht kennt.
Der Schein des Mondes, kalt schimmernd im Schnee.
Sich spiegelnd im stillen Teich, der unberuehrt von menschlicher Existenz,
vergessen in der Einsamkeit ruht.

So wie wir.

Verachtet,
verpoent,
und vergessen
haben wir das Leid mit dem ihr lebt.
Dock kam es ueber euch. Durch und mit euch.
Ich habe es nicht verstanden, werde es nie verstehen.
Doch ist nun die Zeit gekommen...
...und ich behalte recht.
Wartend, Im Schattenlicht, zwischen den Welten(Instrumental)Behind the mountains, angry
Warrior place, they honor
Their beginning and values
Despite all the false faiths

Believers of their own destiny
Respecting laws of nature

Honoring their ancestors
In the past, present and future

As ferocious wolves inhabit the
Dark mountains, protecting their homes
With nails and teeth through the
Flames of wisdom

Land of Fog, Land of South
Land of South, Land of FogIn the dark land it sleeps
But it does not rest
It has been awoken to its call
Whispering thoughts in the shadows
Prophecy of a new empire

Many have fought and died.
In the darkest night they
Their lives , freedom , courage
The torture of their bravery
Temptation , fear doubt

Spawned by a great power
The free people scream out
For their freedom
And the Darkness prevails once more
The army of darkness overwhelms the earth

Treason , torture , pain
War is at hand !
It watches over , without rest
Its cruel power is true

Help yet fails to come
For fear has conquered the hearts
And all hope seemed lost

Annatar
War is at hand
Mordor
Where the shadows lieAngstig heb ik de dag afgewacht
Wanneer ik mijn hoofd zou neerleggen
Een ijskoude val in een bittere tweestrijd
Doornen doorprikten mijn huid
En mijn bloed voedde de aarde
Ik werd omringd door de wezens van de nacht
Hun zoete adem hield mijn lichaam warm
Toen ik ontwaakte in de duisternis
Sprak een zachte stem mij aan

"Wees niet bang , ik leid je de weg
Neem mijn hand en volg me
Naar mijn land buiten de menselijke kennis
Een land vol onnoemlijke pracht."
Toen het manekind zijn glimlach toonde ,
Zag ik de schaduw van de stem

De nacht heeft een onderdaan gezonden
Om me op weg te helpen
Dan vertrokken we langs het kristalnaalden pad
Naar de stad waar de dagen eeuwen duurden

We lesten onze dorst aan de bron van het levenswater,
Maar de kracht van de zon raakte mij niet
De tocht door de duizend poorten was begonnen
Elke mensenziel had hiervoor geleefd

Een leidensweg voor het ultieme genot
Gebukt onder het juk van de dood
Dood verleidt, dood neemt me mee
Dood triomfeert

Stilte nam een nieuwe levensvorm
Een macaber spel met mij gespeeld

De nacht heeft een onderdaan gezonden
Om me op weg te helpen

Toen werd de laatste poort achter ons gesloten
En mijn hart werd gevuld met hoop
Naar de zalige rust van een eeuwigheid

Het doel was bereikt
Chaos hield op
Dood triomfeertBehind the strong fortress
Awakened a lowly kingdom
The sculpted idols
Decorate the empire of lies
 
graven image
full of lies
Be a scary figure

And I'm ready to fight for you

I'm your king and you my queen
I'm your defender, you've chosen me
And together we'll annihilate them!Upon the hills that cross the edge of all these wind-loamed moors
The ghosts of villages scab the grass beneath the dirt
No longer in deep woods I climb a path once thick with trees
No wolves will wait to snatch me
No roots will snare my feet

Long gone the wooded trails that bravely cut the shadow veils
The skies no longer pierced by rows of spikened wood
Above the shapes in grass, raise naked walls to those
Who seek to paint their shelter
And step into their world

To close the door
And walk with kings
Who here dares to walk the path of kings?

Over your shoulder
Through the closing door
Lies a world where all is ours and magic has no place at all
Not so for hilltop man
Who watched the line where sky meets land
A lone path gave him little choice
And here I know and hear his voice

The cruelty of nature
His reasons to be cruel
His reasons to be harder
His reasons to kill fools
His reasons to be master
Through magic might and gods
His reasons to speak truth
And why he had no choice at all

With the wind and the crows
And the big empty space
I humbly walk the only path through this lonely place

Today we choose our cults
False kings that mock and laugh
But on this hill I walk the way
That was the only pathThe Brillant sinister sun
the sky turn into fire
it begins to fall ashes
and the spend street are
devasted cities / mutilated bodies
the earth suffer a disaster
evilness breath in the air!

chorus:

The final day
is that you'll feel
the final day
buried in your mind

Now it's time to die
the sins has never pay
with your skin and meet root
sacrifice and holy rites
anyhow you'll not survive
you go will not save you
the time stopped
your tomb is dug
sin city burned
the slaughter is began!(Instrumental)Reaching for hell
Through the sacrificial butchery
Raping my mind
Loss of all reality
Sacrificial impalement
Summoning the darkness
Transformed by the spell
Ungodly mess I am made

Henchman for the beast
Fulfilling his wretched needs
Ripping you of your life
Taking your sould to my new world

Inverted cross inbedded in my flesh
Marked by the gods I kill for power
Ripping the religion from the gut of Christ
Omnophagia on my malevolent night
Regeneration from holy flesh I eat
Desire for omniscience oncoming slaying of god

My desires engulf you
Cannibalistic sights
A whisper of darkness
I rip my way
To the throne of unholinessI light this white candle for the maiden
Goddess of beginning and the birth of
spring
She is growth, she is fertility
Mirrors all the secret beauty
Of nature and all living things
I light this green candle for the mother
Nurturing and protecting she gave us life
Her breasts are heavy with sweet
summers milk
I grab the Sun Kings antlers, take her as
my wife
With fire and wax this spell shall begin
Invoking the magic from deep within
Three candles on my witches altar
I feel my power, I will not falter
Refrain (2x)
All my wisdom
preserved
And bound in a tome
For those who
shall follow
I am turning a page
Full of magical
lore
In my Book of
Shadows
Tome of the secrets of
Pagans and Witches
Volume of knowledge, of
potions and rituals
Guide for our dances
beneath Lady Moon
Book of Arcana, of Sigil
and Rune
Manual of herbs and of
magical spice
Diary of noteworthy
words of the wise
Foliant of creatures of
land, air and sea
The script of my free will
and so mote it be!
I light this black candle for the crone,
old and wise
She reigns in wisdom like an ancient queen
She guides us through the winters
darkness
When our autumn in this world is slowly
vanishing
Dancing, spinning, Day and Night
Along the neverending wheelCarved from crumbling walls 
Painted black with feathers of hope
Gold leaves strangling the neck
You snatch the souls from the jaws of death

As the sound of your shaking breath 
Slowly quivers down the backbone
Dark bird shadows nourished by your own
People's fears solemnly rise in the distance

Corpses to the jackles buried in the mud 
Rotting black colours of decaying limbs 
Corpses to the jackles lowered in the dust
Rotting stench seeping into the nostrils 

He whose heart is heavy with sin 
Feeding on Corpses
He whose heart is heavy with sin 
shall be ripped to pieces

You weigh the scales for the dead 
In desperate search for eternity 
Scavengers or guardians of hope ?
how (actually) pure is your heart ?In a cold and moonless night
we are lost without a light
we are struggling against the resignation
but in the end there's only desperation

In a world full of noise
we are caught without a choice
we are longing and yearning for salvation
but in the end there's only desperation

All this ache, all this hate
all this pain, all this shame
all this woe and all this sadness

All these fears, all these tears
all these sighs, all these cries
all these lies and all this madness

We are twisting, we are turning
we are yearning for salvation
but in the end it's all desperationI wait here
Winter's graveyard
Cold forever

They sleep here
Iced flesh
Cold forever

See through them
No more lies
Cold forever

Call to them
Blood rising
Cold forever

Wake for me
Undead eyes
Cold forever

Rise for me
Moonless night
Cold forever



 
I die here
Winter's graveyard
Blood surrender

Spill no tear
Iced flesh
Blood surrender

In death trust
No more lies
Blood surrender

Lost to lust
Brood rising
Blood surrender

Teeth showing
Undead eyes
Blood surrender

Smile glowing
Moonless night
Blood surrender- ALMURIC -

Born in a wrong age
In another dimension
In a planet of weakness
In my own desolation 

Damned by my own fate
Hunted by my own race
Hiding from my destiny
An animal is crying inside me 

Ironhand of Almuric 

One day my destiny calls
To leave it all behind
To travel to a new world
On wings of death I ride 

To a world of my powers
A world full of rage
Where life means so little
Where death leads my way 

Ironhand of Almuric 

Icon of barbaric fury and warlust
An ironhand raised to destroy
Warrior reborn from exile to command
Lead on your legions to conquest and to triumphHidden designs in the lines of the skin
In a mood for work and science
Of the mind
Today shelters you
From the flames of tomorrow
Feets such the roots of all trees
Planted in the ground
The link between sky and earth
"Wise lights of the night"
Chosen by the elements to master
Things that couldn't belong to anyone
Stolen from the hands of any deacon
Extracted words from the ancient cults
Far away in the immaculate country
"Wise lights of the night"(Instrumental)Enchanted by the moon
A fresh breeze from the eastern winds
and the wet grass smell, my folk
live under the moonshine of the endless night

Some wars and some wars,
we lost for believing in the lie
that your God would bring us peace
and a place distant of the deep pain

And in the great sabbath nights
Hunted we were until death
didn't respect our children
they slaved our people


Some wars and some wars,
we lost for believing in your lies
now we are, lost in the shadows
and bleeding over the "holy words"

(in a.... dance, pain)

The fake peace of spirit
and false promise of liberty
turn all vine into ashes
You turn our fate into blasphemy
and to judged us by heresy   
burning all our culture(Instrumental)Cosmic Tower endless stairs, ascending steps escapeless
Up words to Darkness infinity, elevation into my madness
Amidst corridors of dark knowledge, I am shouting with our weakness
"We, begotten and forgotten by God, I take thou souls to shadowy art"
Dream in dream in dream I was dreaming, belvedere of life consuming
Night moths deforming to flies, lovely, sweet imagination,
negligibly breaking into shatters...
Eternal mirrors in front of me, what is my Beast and Beauty?
Where are thou our mythical island, what was drowned by ye Oceanus?
In one day and night, ye fragments of ephemeredes collapsed
Knowledge sunk in pelagic abyss, any of us has not therefore "spoken"
Knocking Phoebus of philosophy, ye whip of salt for humanity
Perhaps Atlantis has never fallen, it is ye world in vicious circle
In ye standstill of aeon, in absurdity of saturnine truth
Surrounding plan of contingency, disjecta membra of cognition
Eternal path of freedom, to our ever-reachable Freedom
Deeper and deeper to puzzled dreams, I am ye last mosaic lost
Dark alone, on my own, Void, Death-point, Divine...Silence bleeds
The wounds of time are still open
The Death of thousands I can't forget
Tears in the eyes that can't be seen

It is my sorrow that lasts so strongly!
Banished my spirit in the fog of the field
My sorrow will last so strongly
There is no end to see what's next

Lonesome steps
The Dust will fill them, I'm still here
Tears in the eyes that can't be seen
The wounds of time are still open

It is my sorrow that lasts so strongly!
Banished my spirit in the fog of the field
My sorrow will last so strongly
There is no end to see what's next

Years passed by
Tears still falling on the grass
Loneliness of Eternity
Ghost marching through the field

Heavens take my away from here
Will ever my soul rest in peace?

Years passed by
Snow buried lonesome steps
Restless shadow fades away
Ravens enthrone the night

Heavens take my away from here
Will ever my soul rest in peace?welcome to these moments of doom
which side will you die
the time has come to decide

an ultimate choice in an ever so fierce battle
while blood fills our throats we still remember
those short moments of sheer freedom

an uncanny thrives us swift and well
aware of the final destiny
now is the time for long awaited vengeance
we witness the scientific creation
of the mythic ragnarok

drowning in the ways of guilt
as seasons pass
generations lost
washed out in the storm

and so witness the scientific creation
and so we see

rise
legion of the northern invasion
northern prophets of invasion time
while blood fills our throats
we will still remember moments of blood
and pain

and so we witness this creation
goddriven world of torture and murder
drowning in the ways of guilt, as seaons pass
as we ride(Instrumental)I was born for war, not for love.
Love is not made for my kind...

And mercy is not for them who stand in my way

...Once more the screams of war are heard.
The final battle, hate is all what feeds me.

(...Crushing the skulls of christian scum...)We are blind on this sea,
We can't ear the waves.
We're crying to our
gods,
But they can't ear us !

We're sailing from 12 days,
We can't drink
and eat !
We're crying to our gods,
But they can't ear us !

Odin, helps
our ships,
We have wifes and children !
We can't believe you desert us,
Save
our pagan souls !

All our life, we served you,
We resist to survive !
We
sacrified our lifes,
You can be the noblest !

Odin, helps our ships,
We
have wifes and children !
We can't believe you desert us,
Save our pagan
souls !Jules and his brother, watching the boats
Tellin' stories to each other of the places they'd go
At twenty-thousand leagues meet Captain Nemo
Not much of a plot and owed a lot to Poe
From Phineas Fogg to Impey Barbicane
He fit his fiction to the science of the day
Practically invented the N.R.A.
Wrote Around the World in 80 Days!
Jules' dad sent him to law school in Paris
He wished he was with his brother on a ship
Supposed to go to class but always skipped
Did the coffeehouse bit, started to get Lit
Wrote a couple of boring plays
Soon, Jules was amazed
Writing fiction pays
So, he wrote Around The World In 80 Days!(Instrumental)There's no faith here
To the victor go the spoils
A scapegoat, a straight-coat
A new pale faced Jesus for a pale blue dot
Looking over my shoulder and taking it
All with a pillar of salt
Think you've got this one sewn up?
Doesn't change a thing
Will it help you get to sleep?
Doesn't change a thing
Reset the clocks, Reset the codes
Mirrors reflecting mirrors that you can't
Prove don't exist
Following the light to find a new land
But this golden age is gilded with a cunning hand... Winter came suddenly 
Without mercy it set its icy hungry teeth 
In our necks. 
Heads of noble birds swimming on the water surface 
Flew to thousands of parts just before it froze 
As if struck by invisible hammers. 
Little peevish parts of icy air consumed 
Everything unprepared, wind aided in it and played 
Melancholic symphony of extinction on its silver icicle violin. 
Thousands of icy headsmen with pigs' wailing in the background 
Executed without the only drop of blood. 
... in several minutes only a family of rats remained on the little
island, 
that survived the last winter dance unknowingly ... 
... until the morning the queen of frost 
danced on her icy mirror
At eh snowy throat of winterTwo thousand years
Imposing your lies
Innocent men killed for no reason
Our sacred wisdom being destroyed
Erasing all the culture of a wise race

This is the Christian faith
Lies, death and pain

From the ashes of our ancestors
Our hatred has been born
Pagan temples turned into churches

Bodies on fire
The hammer of witches
Burn all the Christians
And make them pay
For suffering of our ancestors
Bur you damned Christian
In fire that yourself lit

Transforming our Gods into demons
Destroying all the ancient faith

Never... never again the burning times
Never... never again the burning times
Never... never again the burning times

Revenge!

Animus celandi, domini falsandi
Animus habenti obligandi, necandiStorms arise 
With giant waves of death 
When a lightning will strike the earth 
Peaceful vales quake and burst in flames 
Hear the sound of hidden stories 
Which were whispered in the wind 
Walls of stone crush into the depth of the sea 
Never forget the pact between life and death 

Howling wind spreads the seed of heavy rains 
Summon ancient ghosts of the sparkling flame 
In the rhythm of tides time remains 
Wilderness is calling 

Spirits of the oldest realm 
Come alive and bring the fate of our soil 
Fate of our soil 

Power of the sun 
Dry out the deepest lakes 
Force every spark of life into dust 
Where the future lies ahead 
Rain will collect your stream 
All dust turns into bloom 
The night awakes a shadow of silence 
Come and take a breath in the morning dawn 

Coldness of water, warmth of the sun 
Cover the sorrow with your protecting hand 
Create new life where death leads your land 
Come alive daughter of dawn 

Howling wind spreads the seedHear my Sword

the profane rites commence
the daevas welter in gore
banished demons aspire

on the moors the dismal sights arise
the lustring weapons bellow
with myriads we transgress the sick holy lies

it's the end of mayhem

the apostate cherubs revolt against the ethereal sky
where the betrayer hides
wage war against the vaunting god
for he had tied us with adamantine shackles
which we hurl before his feet

among warlords the grim stature rises
woe the baleful saints

but however these plans were pushed
to the edge for completion
a certain revolt was rising
resistance became strong
the disobedient ones
slipped into darkness in spite of
the numerous sentinels
the light was my demise
until we found the craftmanship

it's the end of mayhem

Unbearable silence and a spoiled stench

I close my eyes and try to hide
I blame myself for all the pain
Will I regret my life on the other side? 
Is it worth playing this game

I won't even bother to explain 
so don't ask me to share my burden again
Please, don't judge me now

What made me behave this way?
How could this happen? 

I thought I've left this behind, I'm cold inside
Lost in search for the answers, I'm lost this time
I'll try to hide my shame but it's me I'll betray
I'm cold now, I'm going back, tomorrow I'll find another way

Today started as a promising day
But my grief has taken control
It's too late now, all harm is done
Please don't cry in compassion

I thought I've left this behind... I'm cold inside
Lost in search for the answers... I'm lost this time
In silence I fade away
This time I can't find myself in hereThe day has come
To set history
Brave men will fall
For thy victory 
Outside the walls
War machines wait
The Battering Ram
Approaches the gate

Blizzard of stones
Storming the wall
Huge flaming arrows
Wait for the call

The challenge is great
Defenders are strong
Besiegers are might
They'll stay for long

(written by Marc Leclerc)

[October 2000]

Part I: The discovery of the first victim

Discovered under the bridge at Christmas Eve.

She laid there, lifeless, stab wounded.

Observed two days before with an old man.

Who felt no remorse, no time to grieve.

Part II: The suspects

The headmaster recognised the Devil's portrait.

The suspect was subpoenaed to give evidence,

While cops were combing the scene of crime.

After several interviews, he was released.

The same evening another man was arrested.

Previously sentenced for rape and murder.

Under pressure, he confessed the atrocities.

And the real monster was free; fateful thunder.

Two years later, he found employment as supply clerk.

New job gave him the splendid opportunity to travel

No more under the influence of his wife.

Roamers, sluts, beggars, boozers; rootless life.

KILL AGAIN!!!

Part III: The second killing

One beautiful September day at a bus stop.

People eating, drinking, laughing and fucking.

He approached this seventeen years old girl.

Took her to a deserted stretch of woodland.

Tearing her clothes off, panic, mockery.

Screaming, filled her mouth with dirt.

Beating, strangled her to death.

Madness turned into unbounded frenzy.

Biting off and swallowing one of her nipples.

Finally he ejaculated over the young corpse.

Insatiable appetite awaken.

Incurable taste for blood.

Part IV: Two years of slaughtering

In a period of two years, fourteen victims.

Boys and girls stabbed, butchered.

Once with the Devil, children were doomed.

Above suspicion, alone, marooned.When I look around, I see a land of elevation,
the land we were born, brothers in arms.
Surrounded by the mightiest nature of the teutonian realm,
Let's face the icy wind of a new millennium.

With pride we shall speak
of our legendary woods.

Woods of uncounted tales and mystic scenes,
woods of battles and tragedies,
of mighty hills carved by the blackest valleys.
My homeland, roots of my fathers!

I'm proud of my blood,
my heart beats for my homeland.
I'm proud of my genes,
but I don't need any leader.
I am my own leader.

No-one shall stain this land,
in reverence they shall speak.
So long before our roots had grown.
We have the strength in us to face the icy wind
of this wave of weakness.Obscure times, continual war,
destroyed towns, greed and pride.
Gods destined for oblivion,
asking for help to the guardians of time.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
counting your days, judging your life.
No way to escape to the look of their eyes,
no sword can stop the edge of their scythes.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
witnesses of a sinister past.
When mortals, lost, looked for a guide,
they had to take the guardians on trust.

Guardians of time!

Faithful times, lands of hope,
guardians' promise, a better world.
Gods destined for oblivion,
asking for help to the guardians of time.

The guardians of time!
Judging your life!

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
counting your days, judging your life.
No way to escape to the look of their eyes,
no sword can stop the edge of their scythes.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
witnesses of a sinister past.
When mortals, lost, looked for a guide,
they had to take the guardians on trust.


Superior beings looking down on mankind,
no way to escape to the look of their eyes.
Superior beings looking down on mankind,
when mortals, lost, looked for a guide.

Crossing the night,
as a forest guided by thunderlight.
Lightning can't wait,
so ride through the stars.

And the rivers of time,
dyed by blood
of the ones who once tried
to beat us in war.
We're guardians!

Crossing the night,

Lightning can't wait,

We're guardians of time!

Crossing the night,
as a forest guided by thunderlight.
Lightning can't wait,
so ride... we're guardians of time!I sit at the side of a flare
As lonely as a soul can be
So close to flame that it hurts
Tongue of flame
That hurts inside

Chorus:
Tongue of flame
Can't sleep at night
Tongue of flame
Can't lie to myself
Tongue of flame
I'm weakening in grief
Tongue of flame
Painful tongue of flame

I cry me tears away
I scream out the pain
I look inside the fire
I lose myself in flames

Chorus...

Grief alternates
With wrath again
Lunacy fills the emptiness
I become one with flames
And never look backLearning corporal pain 
Make first step to endlessness 
Tearing flesh with knife 
Beauty of creation

Second step, joy of rack 
Make them feel lust to death

In the murders you comprehend the sense 
As I almost knew
In the torments you find the joy of pain 
As I almost learned

Five steps into infinity
To reach the utmost entirety
Five steps into infinity
To re-arrange the entity

Third step, joy of kill 
Despise the human pity

Foul smell of decay 
Makes you feel the bliss 
Fires of burnt towns 
Bless your blood red path

Forth step, free your flesh 
Mortify your own brain 
Crush your mind with pleasure 
For it cannot resist anymore

Now you're free of the pain
Make the fifth step and the last
The infinity is open
Spheres of cosmos shine for you
In the depths of the spaces
You are fly free of life, free of death
Soaring 'bove the ravaged world lying dead(Instrumental)Tears from the eyes of a warrior,
Exhausted he was lying on the ground
And was hit badly from the battle.
Nothing he could witness anymore, 
only the eternal forests.
Even the smell of nature and
The sound of swords vanished in him.
No hope, no power has been left, only to wait for death.
Heavy for surrounded the forest,
and a endless rain began, when the light of the warrior vanished.
Once a strong warrior,
fallen in fight of honour and loyalty for his nation.
Nothing has been left
The sound of forests, the might of nature,
Even the smell of flowers and meadows,
vanished forever.In a pagan heart just memories ...
In a pagan heart memories of a legacy of glory

False Gods
False prophets
Illusions imposed by insane minds

Greed and power
Lie and glory
Are the reasons Christian

The pagan idols distorted by Christians
Creator of heaven and hell

False Gods
False prophets
Usurpers, motivated by wealth

Greed and power
Lie and glory
It's the end of the world for all

The pagan temple built out of the shadows
From the dark depths of the human soul
Built in connection with the mythical Gods
the eternal connection of the human soul with the pagan gods

In our forests
In our temples
The secrets stored
The cure for the disease in the world(Instrumental)Tears are falling from the trees
Dried yellow leaf-seas
A forest with power lost
Time is here, it has come

Feel the scent of decay 
Silent decaying words of the branches
As they talk with the wind
In hope for a better future

Sad willow, dead bird
There's fog, cold and mud all over the place
The rotting soul of summer sinking
Teardrops are falling from the trees into the deep

Lonely pine forests, misty mornings
See nothing else but the blue sky
At night beyond them the star signs forming a line
The numbers of year rings growing inside

Sound of cry calls from the deep
Like a miserable child shouting towards the sky
With grey and pale face
Maybe one day it existed

Ripple of cracking branches
Mute silent howling
A last teardrop falls down to the ground
The Carpathians singing the song of AutumnEguna hil da iadanik
Ilargia oharaurreko tristuraz
Agertu da. (Bis)

WOOD OF SCREAMS (HARLEQUIN)
The day is dead already.
The moon appears
With the sadness of before going to bed.

The beauty of the night
Caresses the bushes until the river
With its tender cloak.
The wind shakes
The apple trees.

It forms
Spooky shadows,
Where the treasure
of happiness
Is achieved by the harlequin
through his sadness.
He sits down near it
With an apple in his hand.

He can hear
A sweat cry
Coming from the wood of screams.

But the tired harlequin
Prefers to drown in the wind
And be waiting for a victim
From the material world
In order to occupy his place.

A beautiful woman
Is approaching
From the wood of screams
Through the steep slope,
Assisted by the river of glasses,
Because it gives
The necessary wisdom
For the condemned
To believe.Come in the depths of the night and you will see him
Fear clenches your heart and you will run like a coward
For all who stand before him will die; tears bound their faces
and blood becomes your friend in the night,
you will remember his name

Stalks through the depths of the night and you will run from him
Teeth flashing through flesh and you will scream full of vengeance
and cloak hides revenant eyes, stealing your souls
from your life fades faster than promises
you will remember his name

Drinker of souls
Slayer of men
Slay all those bastards who stand in our way

Slay all those bastards who stand in our wayWhen the time has come
Feel the damage done
No escaping
Remembering when you were so wise
Thorns around your spirit
So exhausted constancy
You're floating in your lifeless dreams
Without rest
Embrace of anguish
Absurd distress
To bury in your bed
Expensive seeds of peace
The embrace of anguish shouts
Absurd distressFROM HER WORLD THE SKY'S FADING 
AND THE MOON FROM HER SKY WAS GONE WITH THE STARS 
SHE CAME HOME TO A BLEEK ROOM OF SORROW 
FORSAKING HOUSEM PLACE OF GRID IN SOLITUDE
SHE CAME ALONE [WITHOUT ANY FAITH TO HOLD] 
SHE ALWAYS CAME ALONE...
INSIDE HER TEARS INSIDE HER FEARS 
INSIDE HER TEARS INSIDE HER FEARS 
INSIDE HER TEARS BECAUSE YOUR LIFE AND LIGHT's 
FULLY LOVELESS 
THROUGH HER SILENT EYES

AND I SEE THE WORLD WITHOUT REFLECTION [SEE NO LIGHT IN YOUR SIDE] 
AND I SEE THE WORLD WITHOUT DISTRACTION 
AND I SEE THE WORLD WITHOUT REGRET BECAUSE YOUR LIFE'S LOVELESS

Hrabrih ratnika dolina Severa
Tu je vecna zima maglena
Tu nema mesta licu plamena!
Vojska jase k' hramu Svetovida
Vuk za vukom lanac ne prekida
Nebesa mracna nad njihovim glavama
Spremna da pamete borbu vukova!
Zadnji biva strah u ratnika
Jer strah je slabost,vrlina smrtnika

Samo sloga Srbina spasava!
Trag je krvav od maca necista
Seciva pogana vukove ranila
Al' ne bese to dovoljno

Ponosno hodi k' zemlji predaka!

Samo sloga Srbina spasava!The land of no return
It's quiet here
No life forms
And no calls get through
Communication runs cold

We were only concepts
We were only dreams

One ear to the earth
One eye on heaven
Will the stars grow between us
Until we finally disappear?

One ear to the earth
One eye on heaven
We are strange mirrors
When we fall off the map

Where are the ships on these sea-less maps?
Who will cross the bone-drift
Moonless night?

Refracting into a thousand colours
From the light to consume and divide

Blinking out like a lost lighthouse
Somewhere in forgotten zones

Grant us oh oracle
Of the grave-ward eye
One glimpse throught
The veiled temple of light

Sulphur grief priests
Drip down from the lashes
Bell-metal chimes
The toll of death marches

The toll of death marches...

The land of no return
It's quiet here
No life forms
And no calls get through
Communication runs cold

Out there we are truly nameless
Out there we're null and void
Out in the open we are everywhere
Scattered strangers waiting for something to occur
For the emptiness to consume us...
Will the end be ever near?

I beg the truth but fear to ask my purse lips move but are incapable of speech
Repeating ghost on endless tides
Can only salute in gestures and smilesPoisoned filthy blood,
yellow spots and black death wounds.
Your seed smells, scurvy worm. It has defiled our soil.
Moral demise, a dwindling will. How infectious.
Know that the hate of the unforgiving outlasts eternity

Like a fire whose flames set off a storm in due time.
Come closer, enemy, may our lust for blood grow

Behold our flag, raised high in victory
All is ready for the celebration of chaos and demise
All you, who do not want to be led in blindness
Set the fire of the battleground ecstasy
Gather the demons and fiends of war
We will keep plundering, up to the Heaven's gate.
I can see the sky full of flames.
Reunited hordes obscure the horizon and expand into vast armies of death.
Forth! Exterminate the vermin and burn their stinking bones to dust.
I can see the sky full of flames
Black clouds of smoke will choke all the brood,
their seed must be weeded out.
No graves, no burials.2. A Winter Solstice Eve
(music: Vidar, Nathuruss, lyrics: Vidar)

Seeds of the plague were rooted deep,
Branches of malice grew above mountains majesty,
Blood innocent was turned to wine,
Flowing from wounds of ancient fathers of mine.

Prophecies of flesh I now reveal,
Under twilight skies of ebony,
In the name of God and their belief,
They killed and ordered me to kneel,
But now they'll taste my will...

Ravens, gather flesh for feast,
Rip hearts out of the bodies of our hated enemies,
Tonight is the winter solstice eve
and damn, if I shall ever believe

Nation, the dirge for thee now I must sing,
an everlasting elegy...
Of wonders I dream every night and day
that the suffering one day shall pass away...
But yet on my feet standing I remain,
With hope I stare at the sleeping stones that once my brother were...
Awake...

Blinded by wrath, walking rage path,
For gods that were dethroned by messengers of death
Enslaved... Thus deep...
Vengeance is wine, the darkest sign,
Dead nation's sons are gathered under heavens of thine
Enslaved... Thus deep...

This is the soil, whereupon my temple once stood,
And these the ruins, surrounding this place of doom,
Footsteps of time couldn't harm this testimony,
Shall forever remind of the Winter Solstice Eve...(Instrumental)(Burzum Cover)Spirits of ancient heroes, rise!
I summon thee to come forth and grant me with thy holy powers

Let me be the flesh that wields your swords of revenge
Brave men who lived in those days are not forgotten

Heroes will once again emerge and the holy spirits shall awaken from their slumber to aid them in battle

Weapons and shields are forged... Now the enemy is approaching

Arrows flying, plunging the enemy
swords cutting the flesh, no one spared
priests are sacrificed to the gods
(for the great warriors who have gone to underworld, we salute you and you who fought along our side will be remembered!)

{Outroduction}Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams

Make believe I'm everywhere
Given in the light
Written on the pages 
Is the answer to a never ending story

Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be

Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story
Story

Show no fear
For she may fade away
In your hand
The birth of a new day

Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story

Never ending story
Never ending story
Never ending storyThere's a flame deep inside, 
An inferno for this world, 
An overwhelming disgust, 
For those who walk upon the Earth. 

I hate You! 
I hate You! 

Devoid of conscience, 
Clear of mind, 
I've gathered weapons and my strength, 
My path lit by moon glow, 
A raging storm of deviance, 

See the flames reach toward the sky, 
Feel the icy wind as it whips through the night, 
I stand in anger, 
I stand in anger, 

I hate You! 
I hate you All!(Instrumental)Treat me like a doll
Defenceless and weak
I fullfill your wildest dreams

Forever I shall be the victim
Of your sickness
Torment and pain are guiding me
To desperateness
Showing no mercy at all
You destroy me
Everything you took of me
For eternity
Endlessly
You strangle me

I am on my knees now
Why father,
How can you treat me like this?
You make me feel like
I'm absolutely worthless
Endlessly
You strangle me

I'm locked up in this unholy room
I'm an object of desire, not your childMaggots chew the flesh inside my chest 
All I've got is disease 
Day after day week after week 
I feel the seeds blooming inside of me 

Here is the never ending story; 
Domination is an old glory, 
Look at the lines in the fake texture; 
They will take you to architecture 
So, you can get how simple math in the green nature, 
In the end of your story 
Show your heart and see Kashmiri! 

[One must totally die to find what love is] 

Creation! Domination! 
After 4 Billion years... 
Both are just simulations. 
Do you want to open your third eye? 
Run and feed your old little fly! 
In the end of the dark day... 
Wait for the fucking replay!Lord of the hanged
You present with many faces
Inciting strife, bezerker rage
In the valleys of starlight
Forged maegen sculpts my frame
Through the conquest
Of fear of insanity

Much maligned by history
You're the dark so far away
Dare I trust the drighten
Of nine nights of suffering

Lord of the hanged
You choose the slain
You are the ferryman
Dare I look into your hollow eye
And see the truth inside
You breathe life into
My darkest thoughts

The wild hunt washes across my retina
My face is still but I thrash inside
And join you as you race the torrid skies.

You are all aspects of my heathen soul
Your many names are within me to be called
You inspire me and unbind my threads
Walked through death and back again.(Instrumental)Machines spitting fire,
Commands are unchained from desire,
Hardened by the hammerstrike,
Withstanding all of time with pur
Precision, pace, machine gun fire,
Coldness inbuilt to rule empires,
Hawks of steel with eyes of endless patience,
Modesty, grand key to survival.

Key to survival, heartlessness,
Grand pillar, inhaling the storms of the world.

Machines, trampling down
The narrow path to be wide as a field,
Breaking ice, hellish blaze alike,
Hearts replaced by clockworks,
Never to fail...

No need for enemies,
As long as mind, as flesh is weak...

So shall the needles fuel the demons
To whisper the myth of
A stable existence
Is nowhere near to be found on the shaking blade,
Path over mountain tops,
Luring the sick into hell.

For it is us, walking time upon the silver blade,
The luring stars guide the way on towards doom,
It is up those nights to crown the kings or tke it all,
Bare flesh on poisned steel, intoxication, then the fall.

Once in a while, a bonfire in the distance far,
Never close enough to reach, however worth the leap.

For it is us, walking time upon the silver blade,
The luring stars guide the way on towards doom,
It is up those nights to crown the kings or tke it all
Despairing of a million miles of bloodshed,
hunter, this is your call...Faraway, in some darkest times
Promised myself to never touch the end
Today, after strong winds blowing
Promise myself to never bring it back...
To earth

Violently
Secretly
Eternally
Another realityBreathe deep the winds of change
As winter grips once more the land
In highland streams my warrior son
Cleanse the bloodstains from thy hands
Drink from crystal waters cold
Release thy mind from plight
For there be no need of penitence
When honour rules the fight...Give me to Flames
So I shalt Suffer

Give me to Darkness
So I shalt SeeYour stinking perfume can't hide piss
With my lethal arsenal I serve you Hell
Bloodstained I rejoice watching you wither

The turbulent abyss within
The urge, the hunger 
Demanding your funeral I feel so alive

No-one- is closer to the Devil
than me on my nightly raids
Hell prepares a red carpet for me

Murder... executioner procedure 
Murder... death bringer strategy
Murder... ill will amhush 
Murder... carnivorous manoeuvre

Murder... a sharp caress by knife 
Murder... massive triumph over lifeI Live In This World I Did Not Create
Where Light And Darkness Make Up Each Day
So Why There's No Light For Me To See
Am I Living Or Is This A Crazy Dream
Why do I Feel This Way. Why

I've Got This Feeling Locked In My Mind
To Much Darkness Afraid To Close My Eyes
I See No Light That Tells Me That You're Near
So Full Of Pain. For Your Presence I Fear
The Choice Was Mine To Make
From The Beginning I Made Mistakes
Now There's No Choice. I'm Going Down
I See The Light. Or Are These Flames I've Found

Awaken Me. I've Had Enough Of This Misery
Won't You See. Can't You See. I'm Losing My Insanity
Please Cut The Chains And Set Me Free

Let Me Be. I'm Going To Change The Life I Lead
I Can't Believe This is The Chosen Place For Me
Please Cut The Chains And Set Me Free(Instrumental)(Instrumental)From the Depths to the Peaks
Listen to the Voices of Worlds

Swallow the Seed of Knowledge Sail the Seas of Vision
Crush the Walls of Conscience
Close your Eyes to see
Bite the Serpent's head
Wash your Feathers
Take Dead's hand

Come join the Dance !Centuries of war 
Blood has painted these rivers red 
Remnants from before 
Oceans formed from the tears that we shed 
Maelstrom of scorn 
Hills and mounds born from the bones of the dead 

A pile of smoldering ashes 
Swirls of smoke rise to the sky 
We say our farewells to this old age 
To this dying war 

Centuries of war 
The strife is coming to an end 
Cogs creak and turn 
Our thirst for reprisal is finally quenched 
Changing new dawn 
So long we fought for this day 

Chorus 

Centuries of war 
Tomorrow we will be and know nothing 
All that we are 
Lie in the palm of these bloodied hands 
Legate of truce 
I thrust my sword deep in his back 
Long live the war 

Chorus 

All hail the oncoming storm 
Long live the warCountless winters,
ere Earth was formed
Bergelmir was born
That I first remember
when that wise Jotun
in an ark was laid...

Of Ymir's flesh
was Earth created,
of his blood the sea
of his bones the hills,
of his hair the trees and plants
of his skull the heaven

And of his brows
The gentle powers
formed Midgard for men
but of his brain
the heavy clouds are all
created...

By the shore, two trees of life
Three breaths from the mighty ones
Arise in flesh, Ask and Embla, 
The first of mankind...From the clatter of hooves of our
battle horses
Trembles and shakes all our Earth,
And thousands of arrows, which
covered the sun
For enemies carry death.
And beings ready to conquire or
die in the fight
We're gonna seize all world
Brave and ruthless, proud and wild,
Barbaric hordes from North.
Our swords are sharpened
Our spears are strong
And nothings gonna save the enemies
We're gonna make the greatest feast
On their broken bones
And drink their blood as a wine.
Wild march has begun and quite soon
We'll bring to the knees all that world
Great and evil, true and strong
Barbaric hordes from North.This is the brilliant master race!
a spirit beyond even blood
Ariya, Ariya, Ariya, Ariya!
the black sun is rising for the final root race!

The stars are forming into Othila runes
Vieleinige- Vielspaltige- Vielheit!
a racial cosmos unveiled to us!
from the heights of the north
to the depths of the east
Indo-Europa!
and the swastika in our genes

Strive on! towards the sun
a spirit beyond the flesh
ruling the feminized masses!
with our discipline of steel

White is right
unified we ascend out of this stinking mudhole
Sieg Heil!Hidden in the deepest forests,
hordes of heathen warriors were living.

So strong and full of pride.
As the last of their kind,
they took their destiny in hand,

to fight and defend what was holy to them.
They had looked through the knowledge of the runes,
and wanted to bring them back to life.

Rise the horns up to battle,
with sword and horse, into the war.
Many had to die, as sword and shield has broken.
Fallen, full of pride and honour.

Valkyries took them to Valhall.
Dense fog covered the sky,
and the secret of the runes was blown away by the wind.Shockwave Rider put us in deep shit
Inescapable jagged orbit
John Brunner put our horrible future in print
We sheep won't look up 'til our throats are slit!
Those astronauts should not have landed
Everything is going just like John planned it
Dropped a hint with Sanctuary in the Sky
The amazing thing is he's still alive
John write while we sleep and die
Stand on Zanzibar!
Father of Lies!Rise!
Hear the call of pure ancient blood
The forces within - forces of heathen spirit
Which unite greater nature with own soul

Awake!
For too long your true selves have slumbered
Imprisoned by insidious barricades of alien origin
When the blood calls, heed it's voice

Furor teutonicus
An immortal oroborous links past, present and future
Emanating from the axis of the sun's wheel
Forever turning, driving true destiny

To reach the stars
And conquer the greater whole
Universal dominion - galactic supremacy
Distant worlds await the first footsteps
Of Aryan explorers

The final goal
To expand beyond primitive beginnings
Leave this dying earth
To those who would destroy themselves

Eventual return
To a desolate, wasted planet
Finally cleansed by the beast's own greed
The centre of our galactic empire
Rebuilt from ashes of the past
And the steel of the future...a door opened in a crack as the great old Tree falls..

Another reality takes place
Covering a World in deconstruction
Stone after stone, dust after dust
Vision after vision, fear after fear...

No more familiar voices
No more guiding fame
To light my step on this unknown snaky way
To secret knowledge
Only ashes of Time and Space

Hanging on the branches of a dead tree
I vacillate upon the void
Mocked and threatened by the Winds of Torment
Screaming at my cars, whipping my flesh

With only terror as allied
I am falling deep
Through the splinters of a life
That once was mine

Crying out in silence
As only the dead can do
Now I dance
Hand in hand with the deadOh! Mighty gods you consecrated the mystical rites.
Oh! You celestial, oh you infernal and of the sea.
Oh! Greatest polemarhs that nobody can confront you.
Oh! You that holding the copper cymbals.
Oh! You that come to earth with your shining armor.
Oh! You black dragons of eternal earth.

Hear our calling.

We raise our hands
Towards the sky
Towards the earth
Towards the sea
And we call upon
Korivantes the mighty gods

We call upon
Korivantes to rush again, rush again.

Oh! You that have the darkest countenance
And rush vexed against the mortals
With only purpose the destruction.

You that your breaths give life
And rage destroys everything as it passes.

Waarrr

And when their blood will flow on earth
Then you will blow your divine breath towards us.

Waarrr(Instrumental)The whispers, shouts
Their horde approaches
Wotan! Father of all
Lead us to glory
Began our war in this dirty world
That destroys itself

We'll burn their temples
Their legacy and ignorant kind
And we'll shout Hail Wotan!

In the cold abyss
Will rest the bodies of the fallen
And in Valhalla
We'll be victorious

Winter has fallen
The forests lie frozen
And our souls burn with hatred
By the destruction of their cross
That fall under the heavy rain

We are not the first ones
We are not the last ones
Because this fight will continue 
After our death

Wotan! Father of all
Lead us to glory
Began our war in this dirty world
That destroys itself

Hail!
Hail!
Hail Wotan!Sodomize Their God
Destroy your Faith
The virgin Mary, I Rape

They Praise The False
Invert their Disgusting Cross
Nothing but a Lost Cause 

Ruin the sound Once Again 
Worthless Trend 

Long ago Black metal was War,Hatred,Darkness and Death
Fuck Off christian Black Metal
Death Before this horrible Dishonour.Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too lateBeyond the darkened hills of the north. Through the forrest of memories. Soulful torment hangs from the cloud ridden skies. The wolves howl in horror. The broken wasteland screams in displeasure. As the frost of the night settles upon the stone land. Impossible dreams become reality. The minds wish becomes one with nature. The once dead land comes to life again, rising to the sky. Reaching to the gods. The moutains crumble over the distant cities. Crushing the fools. Waves of destruction pound upon the earth. Destroying all that once was. The once peacefull earth, strikes back with the ferocity of ten billion armies. Mankind is destroyed, the land rebuilt. Beyond the darkened hills of the north. Throught the forest of memories. There lies a stone. That shows that fall of man.This is the culture you will never know
Of wicked faces, tube will never show
The idyll of sound mind I s'pose we'll never know
Not even broadcast of the devil's show

Do you hear the noise? It's in your system...

This is attraction you will never know
You dub it filth, the filth is not for show
Is that the only thing you'd really like to know

Distant from each living existence
In the foothills of nothingness
Caught in the edge of the world
Before the step to the abyss
Testify of primal rites of all joy torn
The ascending crusade on endless journey

Hear the calls of damnation
Horrible voices from the dead choir
Frozen waves beyond terrestrial intelligence
Ghastly faces in the mirror of the universe
Frightening and devoid a soul
The hell's main side

No longer in the hands of god
I'm breathing in the dark fire
The storms of lust and desire
A blackened veil embraces my heart
It changes my perception
And feels like an uncanny experience
It penetrates me

It dwells deep in cosmic spheres
The desecration of organic life
Domination and default to savior
The consecration of chaos and pain
The world is not their own anymore
Only dark matter envelops all life
It penetrates me

Black can be darker
Eternity can be more cruelly
And death can show the ultimate wrath
It takes your soul apart
But it's sure that darkness engulfs all being
This torment is not an illusion
It penetrates us in order to give us illuminationBracia podniesmy z duma glowy

The land where our forefathers once roamed 
The land of frost as we know it 
As the moon blissfully watch over you as night become 
The valley so cold yet so warm as you wander 
In the land of frost life means nothing 
Here you are the immortal one 
All you need is the mother earth to survive 
This is an everlasting relationship 
Tis here you will lay down to die 
But until the night your breath ends 
Until then... you live life day by day 
Until one day... Until one day... Your breath ends 
But today is not that day 
Roaming the fields of glory 
Tis here many have fought 
Tis here the sword lay stuck in the ground 
Tis here men of valor laid down to die 
Tis here the tears of fallen rain from the sky 
Glorious men on horse they rode 
Battles to intrude on human existence 
For the honor of the homeland 
Tis here the crusade vanquished 
You honor those who sacrificed for honor 
Hearing their cries in the wind through the forest 
The land the tyrant laid benighted through many an onslaught 
The land of frost as we know itOn fields of war, we had to grow
A bloody rage, a hear of stone
That's what we have learned

When bullets fly, above your head
No time to lose, there's no regret
It's fight or be dead

Soldiers marching on, the last command
Young souls raising hell, rain of fire
Warcries fill the air, will this ever end?

They kill for greed, not peace to find
Forget the past, don't look behind
Don't stand in the line
A secret plan for mind control, the price of life?
Expendable, that's what we all are

Soldiers marching, for the final stand
On their road to hell, load your guns
When sirens scream the end, living in despair

When a lonely child prays to the sky
Dreaming of kingdoms, of ages gone by
When a million voices join as one
A new star is born, the king claims his crown

March, they march, in the rain and mud
Lords of torment and disorder
Flashing lights, in the dead of the night
Heralds of attack and violence

Burning in the flame, of unholy forces
Locked in a spell, you'll never be free
Gazing at the sun, looking for a vengeance
Black soul, blood red steel

Pouring on the land, like a rain of evil
Sewers of the storm, leaders in command
Marching in the rage, of a magic winter or a fiery sandOut of the South from the deserts of Muspell they came,
on their banners the cross of their lord,
to bring a new wisdom to green land of plenty,
to bring us salvation with fire and sword.
They came here to tell us the nature of God,
but if their god knew Nature as well as does Wod
then would they have still piled our priests high on the pyre
and polluted our green land with blood and with fire? 

They promised great riches and wealth when we die,
and forced us to starve and our children to cry;
a tenth of our harvest, a tenth of our grain,
all of our freedom, get none of our pain;
but Nature's the one who did suffer the most
as they stole all Her glory with their idle boasts,
for they claimed that their god made them lords over all
and that all things must bow before them or must fall.

Where once our days were timed by hands of Fate
and we lived in the balance with plenty for all,
priests turned the tables, they b[r]ought the imbalance,
they said they should live e'en though Nature must fall;
tore down the forests to feed the new millions,
used Mother Nature to conquer disease;
fools, can't you see, have you no understanding?
rose in the cornfield must burn with the weeds.

Tied to the stake, is it a dream, some mistake?
What's my crime? Will I awake?
Am I evil? Have I wronged thee?

Fire burns my eyes, sears my flesh, drowns my cries.
Skin is black, in twitches it cracks.
Is this your mercy? Is this the mercy of your god?

Who is this god that I hear you call Satan?
Just a figment of Christian mind,
yet still you burned kinsmen and women as his.
Tell me priest, are you really so blind?

Hear the screams of the cat in the basket
as the priest hung him over the fire.
What was his crime? Where was his jury?
Tell me priest? Did fuel your desire?

See the wood ring all blackened and barren.
"We must burn out this Heathendom haunt".
How do you justify wanton destruction?
Tell me priest, did the trees your god taunt?

You preach that the end of the world will bring your salvation
and so you await Armageddon with baited breath,
proclaiming to the masters of She who prevents the ascension,
and, to fulfil thy desire, you would sentence us all to death.

They've planted their seed among us for so long,
tis time to root out that which does not belong;
only chance left, our world's life to prolong.
The harvester's ready, the scythe has been whet,
too long have the masses played russian roulette,
putting the gun against Earth Mother's head.

Hurry my brethren, there isn't much time,
gods call for vengeance divine.
See that the punishment fitteth the crime.
Earth Mother's patience has lasted so long.
Be sure that Her fury will be just as wrong.

Burn the priest, just as in thy name so many have burned before thee.
As many were beaten to death on the wheel then so in their name I scorn thee.
Burn the priest for thy time has passed, thy words and thy teaching abhor me,
for if you would rally the end of the world then thy world must end before me.

The time it has come to light a new pyre,
take up thy torches and strike up the fire.
Witness the flames reaching higher and higher.
Old wood must burn to give way to the new.
New shoots grow out from a faith that is true;
out from the world which our forefathers knew.

For all of our fathers who died at the stake,
make the amends for that bloody mistake.
This land, once ours, must be ours to retake.
Where once the alters [guessed "altars"] of our gods did lie,
churches of Christendom rise to the sky.
Where once rose flames, now let flames rise on high.

Burn the priest, just as in thy name so many have burned before thee.
As many were beaten to death on the wheel, then so in their name I scorn thee.
Burn the priest for thy time has passed, thy words and thy teaching abhor me,
for if you would rally the end of the world then thy world must end before me.

Out of the South from the deserts of Muspell they came,
on their banners the cross of their lord,
to bring a new wisdom to green land of plenty,
to bring us salvation with fire and sword.
You came here to teach us the nature of God,
but your god forgot Nature and you forgot Wod.
Now it is your turn to burn on the pyre
and our green land will be cleansed with blood and with fire.I see no progress, where's the knowledge?
I became sick, maximized abhorrence
Just a usurper, a utilitarian
Civilized methods of a modern barbarian

Morbid Inheritance

Take everything for granted, selective ignorance
Profit is the lord you salute, a great truth you dodge
There's no evolution, in primitive ways you act
Your days are numbered, yours kind not to lastKissing your smooth blue lips correct
With my hands tight around your neck
Your eyes once so bright now dead
Staring blindly in your head

Techniques of torture;
Tyranny total supremacy

[Lead: Marcus Lundberg]

Profanation of a body so divine
Mistreating it as it was mine
Humiliation of your empty soul
Piercing your mind no self control

Techniques of torture;
Tyranny total supremacy

Blood drenched in violent acts
Ripping your skin and burning flesh
Rape murder becomes art in slavery
And your labour gives me supremacy

Techniques of torture;
Tyranny total supremacyI am sure you deserve it 
 you were the one, 
 who declared this war. 
 I was your loyal friend the only one... 

 And here i am, in front of you. 
 I'll ask you just once. 
 Why did you do that shit? 
 why you were so unfair? 

 No answer ,means no mercy... 
 I grabed the axe, 
 smashed down your head 
 to see the blood and brain. 

 The only thing i need, 
 your eyes in my hands to feel. 
 And feed them to the dogs, 
 till the revenge bring peace...

Wept for the loss of life and wisdom
Dark horizons reflect the bleak nature
Of my despairing soul

And so I mourn.....

Peril came to many this cold season
Swords came to rest on soils of desolate winter
Shields failed, helms cast aside
Midst the bitter fury of war

Chill are the winds
Which hasten from the snow capped peaks
Solitary oaks shiver against their dismal caress
Lone is the raven soaring in the brooding sky
Weary my heart to walk the battle plains

And so I wander.....

Into the forest's embrace
Inspired by the might of the trees
Dense oaken halls of evergreen
Glistening under twilight's grey
Enriched by the offering of the skies

Standing defiantly evermore
Neath the endless burden of melancholy(Instrumental)I walk through the forest, Fangorn
As an old man cloacked with my staff
The fire if all that is left
The smoke of Isengard soon I will spread
For my spies, bird, wolf and man
Shall inform me of all their plans

I know the path you walk, I know the beast you stalk
For Men are are now my prey, I foresee all thei days

My colors once ran white
Now the oil coils around my cloak
In the forest once I did walk
But now I'll burn them all down

I know the path you walk, I know the beast you stalk
For Men are are now my prey, I foresee all thei days

An army of superior blood I have bred
Been born to conqueror all the land of Men
Down to the last women and child

I walk through the forest, Fangorn
As an old man cloaked with my staff
The fires are all that is left
The fire of Isengard now I have spreadThrough the ages of darkness, the road lit only by moonlight. The secrets of our past arise from the depths of our unconscienceness. Like an ocean of forgotten memories crashing upon me with the force of one million armies. Time is my only enemy. It weakens me with age, and casts it's shadows upon my soul. Sorrow escapes my being, only hate breeds within me.Wandering through the darkness. My thoughts drift to what once was. A time of glory, before the plague of man. Lost to the world, lost to these fools. I am one without an army. But, I shall never give up. Although many stand against me. I shall see my wish come to reality. Floating, hovering, searching for the key. Through forrest long since forgotten. Across marshes dread throughout time. Over anchient villages, through Kingdoms of ruin. The wolrd shall fall to it's knees at my very existance. And at that moment, I shall reach out my hand and crush it, as it did me so long ago.Hark my son these words.
Cattle die and brothers die, 
one day we'll die ourselves,
but this song of praise will never die
of he who has glory gained.
So fear not the coming twilight
when giants and gods collide,
for when once more the steel shines in our hands 
then truly we are heroes beneath the heavens.

It's a fine day to die...In its depth prestine and wild
Mighty and free since all ages
Defying all fury of storms
Eternally sheltered in forest's heart

The winding path, who know s to find
Leading along to venerable gates

Vast of time elapsed to past
Yet in memory it still remains
The elder once adored herein
Gods and Spirits of forlorn worlds

And not forgotten are their songs
In trees and branches echoing forth
Of valkyries and vanir, aesir and albs
Conquered enemies and heroic deeds

Within the year's shortest nights
Tribes gathering at wellknown glade
No iron shall break the ancient rules
Yet curse desecrate the sacred place

Strenghtened ground through foes' blood
Dared to oppress the men of north
Embraced by roots, sentenced their death
Their corpses shall rot to groundFar above the icy waves
Darkness enters the land
Death is lurking everywhere
As mighty warriors we stand
Torch lit faces fill the night
As we storm the shores
Spoiling blood of innocent
As we cry for war

Old ghost from the past
Come to hunt my soul
Claiming their vanquished spirits
To Valhalla I block the doors

High before me the city gates
Raven black before my eyes
By force we take their homes
Beneath blood red skies
Insanity fills the brains of
The so called northern men
Spreading fear and death
Only leaving barren lands

Victorious we are again
Back to the halls of North
Stalking through the ever dark
Uncertain to reach my goalI'm in league with Satan
I was raised in hell
I walk the streets of Salem
Amongst the living dead

I need no one to tell me
What's wrong or right
I drink the blood of children
Stalk my prey at night

Look out
Beware, when the full moon's high n' bright
In every way, I'm there
In every shadow in the night

Evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan

I'm in league with Satan
Obey his commands
With the goat of Mendes
Sitting at his left hand

I'm in league with Satan
I love the dead
No one prayed for Sodom
As the people fled

Look out
Beware, when the full moon's high n' bright
In every way, I'm there
In every shadow in the night

Evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with Satan

I'm in league with Satan
I am the masters own
I drink the juice of women
As they lie alone

I'm in league with Satan
I bear the devils mark
I kill the new born baby
Tear the infants flesh

Look out
Beware, when the full moon's high n' bright
In every way, I'm there
In every shadow in the night

Evil in league with Satan
Evil in league with SatanDying slowly dying
The pain is growing more and more
Helpless to disease
Nails in deep nails in deep
Driven to hell
The blood starts to spill, fall
Driven to hell
The cries are so shrill
To lord won't hear your call
Aggressive crucifixion
Blood on the cross blood on the cross
Rotting flesh is rotting
Scream in pain it does no good
Pounding eternal dread
Nails in deep nails in deep(Instrumental)Still a young and innocent child 
Beaten by his mother and abused by his father 
She always told him ?Dont look through the key-hole, 
When Im busy with your uncle? 

Conflict and anger in his mind became worse and worse 
This beautiful cat of our crazy neighbors 
?I could torture and rip it up?, he thought 
Little experiment to control life and death 

Hate, death & sexual desire burning inside him 
Love he needs, but pain and suffering he brings 
The cat became a little pretty blond girl 
Raped and beaten to death, his first human victim 

CHORUS 
Welcome to the labyrinths of deviance 
Enter the gloomy world of depravation 
Into the labyrinths of deviance 
Enter the gloomy world of depravation 

Losing control of his murderous destiny 
What was wrong with this affectionate man? 
Dreams always turned to deviated sex 
Combined with mutilation, open wounds 

CHORUS 

One after one, raped, sodomized, killed 
Each murder more cruel and perfectionated 

The bodies lacerated, cut into pieces and burned 
Ultimate abomination, gruesome hallucination 

Dark fantasies became obssessive reality 
Body count growing month after month 
Sheer panic spreading out in the city 
Unstoppable bloodbath was his fate 

The bodies lacerated, cut into pieces and burned 
Ultimate abomination, gruesome hallucinationTrinovantes Demetae,  Caledonii

Together we are one, one tribe, one tongue,

Raise the mead horns in the great hall of  the gods

In a cold catacombs, where floor is covered by bones

The Great Mother Kibela
Worshippers still remain
In dark dungeons and grottoes
Where subhumans are grown up as food for

Rats! Funeral march of the
Rats! Funeral march of the
Rats! Funeral march of the 
Rats! Funeral.

Downwards and downwards on a ladder...
Feel the horror and panic of subhuman remains
Gnawed and nibbled skeletons 
Open their mouthes in mute shout

Sacrificial altar in a center of the dungeon
Moist walls covered by blood and web
Here no light shines and no sound were through the ages
Only decayed bones keep a secret of 

Rats! Funeral march of the
Rats! Funeral march of the
Rats! Funeral march of the 
Rats! Funeral.... 

Subhuman flesh and body is a food for the Masters
In rusty cages and shabby sheds new brood is fattened
The mad shepherd with an ugly demonic snout
Forces ugly creatures to dance absurd dance of death

Avalanche of rats from hell chasms
Breaking loose, devouring all on the way
Devouring scum herds and shepherd
The dungeon floor is covered by moving, hungry gnawing layer of 

Rats! Funeral march of the
Rats! Funeral march of the
Rats! Funeral march of the 
Rats! Funeral....(Instrumental)The castles are burning,  in the mountains there's just blood
On the caves there's just shadows, I am bound on this darkness
It's always I deserve to me, now I can feel true evil inside my heart
I don't know how tomorrow will be
But I will fight on the satan's battle, forever an eternal warrior the never desist
Those surpass all the obstacles like the winds that blows on the mountains
Death is not the end, just the beginning here in the darkness alone and quiet
I am searching for knowledge hidden on this ancient scrolls
That keeps the evil power of satan
So cold... So cold... So cold
So cold as the winter in this dungeon
I thought my past, my present and my future
the answer for me is in the darkness
My meaning of life and my will to live
Lord of evil and darkness will walk
Through this land at nightGlory rides on our swords
Flags are proudly flutters high
Let's roar the battle horns
Before the storm to enemies side
We'll fight 'till victory
We came to rape your saints
We scorch across the world
As whirlwind on the warflames

[Chorus:]
Like a fire flow we fall on foes
By the melting snow of newborn spring
Mother Earth will snake to bones
Morning will be broken by the screams
We didn't never stopped on way
Drive the foes to the mountain high
And we'd throw off them from cliffs
Rock was turned to red by the strange blood

Punishment and pain
We're judgement of all times
On junction of starways
We had bonded in bloodline
See the sign of war
With rise of Northern star
Patricians of the world
Are waiting their hour

[Chorus:]
Seeds of war had growed for ages
From abyss of ancient oceans to light
Friends went under our flags
Through the fog of early spring cold night
Next day will terminate the lie
Waves of steel go out from stained shores
Battle smoke will shut the sun
And return pride and grace to the my landIt's the name of the man not the monster
The start of it all, started small in her subconscious
You were a genius and boy was your dad pissed
You went against his wish
married Percy Bysshe
Percy's first wife comitted suicide
At the thought that you'd be his new bride
Yuo were obsessed with life and death
Three dead children
No baby at your breast
Disowed by your father but when the money ran out
Guess who he bothered
Only took one book
To fill us all with fear
And make a new form of writing appearOur hordes gather in the forests
we strengthen our spirits in scared ritual
anewing the ancient oath of blood 
as our father did before

Through cold Nordic winds
with fire and with steel
with no fear inside
and no mercy left to spare

We are riding onwards
into glorious victory or death
wolfish warriors raging
to strike with no remorse

Blood and Spirit

On the wings of death we ride
blessed by the gods of war
we bring forward
the end of this world

Their temples laid in ruins
their order turned to dust
fulfilling our destiny
we lay waste the world of god

Blood and Spirithey she's rising from her cold grave
Bitch vampire dancing at it's gaze

By the moonlight gave farewell
By the moonlight, by the cold night

Hey, bloodthirsty red stary eyes
She's gazing at my side for my bloodwine

By the moonlight gave farewell
By the moonlight, by the cold night

Hey, sister of darkness is unleashed
Risen from her lair for a bloodgiven feast

In it's glory when she is fed
Gives farwell to my milk white neck

By the moonlight gave farewell
By the moonlight, by the cold night

Hey, sister of darkness is unleashed
Back to her lair for a bloodgiven dreamsThe songs are singing and the beer drinking
We are feasting - we are pleasing the Gods
Night is like days 'cause fires light it
Joy is at faces and let fear become ashes

Night is like day and here is our happiness
Holiday of fathers and here is our gladness
Tomorrow we will be at work again
Now we're singing the songs, praising the gods 

chorus:
Gorgeous sunshine brings us joy
Bright sickle Moon is now with us
Holiday of fathers is now with us
Holiday of fathers is the holiday of ours
We gathered here together
To recollect our fathers

The time of battles for now passed
Let's chase away time of grief
Our children are here with us
Our ancestors are here with us

Eleanor rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father mckenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?Harsh Winter, dry summer
Barren fields, arid rivers
Dead fatherland...

The sun reflects on the steel
of the sacrificial knife you'll feel
Now you will die for the glory of our gods
Now you will die for the future of our folk
You are tied down to the stone
The knife cuts to the bone
Streams of warm blood flow from your veins
The gods will show us another way

Hostile tribes, treacherous guides
Dense woods, swollen rivers
A new fatherland?

Your throat is cut over the bowl
The Norns decide over your soul
Now you will die for the glory of our gods
Now you will die for the future of our folk
Your entrails are ripped out of your body
The gods will lead on, by this sacrifice
Streams of warm blood flow from your veins
We're out to destroy Rome, whatever it takesNau de vento, nau dos homes
Que vogan na inmensidade
Somos xente de Galicia
Onde a terra bica o mar-e
Nau de somos, nau de espranzas
Nau de infinda veleidade
O esquece as suas raices
Verde a sua identidade.This is a story of,
what we often call warriors.
Where I've gone now I have died,
is a Hall in the sky,
that lies,
across a shimmering rainbow bridge.

I see my brothers here,
drinking in the hall.
I see my mother's tears,
lakes of glass before.
I see my people living,
back through the before.
They know that I am here,
toasting them at the gates Waelhall

Men and women folk,
live your lives with honour.
Keep the fires alight on the hills.
The only thing you really have to do,
is cross that rainbow bridge

I see my brothers here,
drinking in the hall.
I see my mother's tears,
lakes of glass before.
I see my people living,
back through the before.
They know that I am here,
toasting them at the gates Waelhall

Some folk have heaven.
That is their path.
Some folk have nothing.
That is their loss.
Let each man or woman,
have his or her own fate.
But I'll, 
I'll take the shimmering rainbow bridge

I see my brothers here,
drinking in the hall.
I see my mother's tears,
lakes of glass before.
I see my people living,
back through the before.
They know that I am here,
toasting them at the gates Waelhall(Instrumental)from my eyes bloated by the cold
I gaze this smoking battlefield
swarming with heaps of corpses
which give off a stuffy smell of rot.
from my fleshless hands
which firmly hold my ruthless ax
dripping with the flow of my foes
our land will be soiled with their blood.

through the mist we defend our own life
under the sinister sky we fight
until the death we will defeat
all those who dare to face our clan.

from my bleeding jaw
I call out my last fellows
standing up for what we trust
we fight against our own fear.
from my weary feet
treading the sand of the northern seas
I make my way across the time
hoping to come upon freedom.

through the mist we defend our own life
under the sinister sky we fight
until the death we will defeat
all those who dare to face our clan.

with pain I'm going through
my struggle for life
dragging a broken leg with skin flagging out
before dying I'll have taken so many lives
fear will fly around our realm for long time.

blood giving will redeem me
with fathers I will drink
from my death I take
the path toword the peace.

from my burning funeral bed
my flesh is turning into grey dust
rising up to the welcoming sky
my freedom will surely never die.
my soul is now flying
through the brightest shooting stars
far away bloody battlefields
I will lighten and dream forever.The darkness hides the moonlight 
Vision of the end of astral plane 
The rotten forests
The soul impure 
Revealed pagan memories 
The Gods prophecy is realized 
Written in ancient monolithic
Voices from night of darkness 
Into the rites of death 
Lost in the fire of the night 
Infernal spirits spread the terror 
Terrifying visions of the end 

Into the hall of death
The serpent stole the light

The prophecy time has come
For the end of the night

The constellation of Orion
Show the path of terror

The pagan temple is burning
Under the serpent of fire

In eternal dreams 
sadness dominates the soul 
Abstract visions dominate the mind 
Paralyze the emotions
Lost in a timeless state 
Empty and cold, nothing is real 
Sick souls
Calls for trial
Just the feeling of the end

In the cold mountains rises from the shadows the first sun 
By blood sacrifices to the gods life resurfaces 
In the temples of the sun and moon pagan existence 
Eternal Celebration of Build a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Burn the bridge behind you, leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path and cut eachothers throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads, their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel and know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steelWhere the is fire, there is smoke, and in that smoke out comes the inevitable day of men's downfall. The day when they finally and self destructibly turn its weapons against its own kind. The day of the blade in the sky, when your cities lay buried under radioactive rubble, and the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland, in which there will be no place for humans, and that day is upon you, now!!!Bezlikoe nebo,
Zvezd slepyh karnaval!
Meteorov blednyj potok,
Nesushchij smertel'nyj ogon'.
Pronzit on tebya i menya

Ochishchenie pridet!

Stanet bagryanoj zemlya
Ot teh, kto prozhit' ne sumel
Kto ne skinul pokrovov s lica.
No ya vizhu ih vpalye rty,
Gryzushchie hleb bytiya

No ne vse smogut plyt'.

Ne pomozhet, net!!!

I razbit odinokij utes
Na Golgofe davno
Pogasili ogni palachi

Cherez smert' i potop 
Ochishchenie pridet...What have you ruined 
A shadowy cloud of chaos 
As screamed feelings 

Once drunked of wonder 
In inocense and wide-eyed 
With desire died 

A deadened morass of lies 
Memories follow hate, follow pain 

Love ground to dust 
In a haze of sorrow 

I condemn you!There was a night - the only night that was real
Felt like i'm the chosen one
But there was no thunder, there was no lightning
So I thought I were dreaming on

Straight on through the gates of heaven
Evil will destroy the souls
Where's your saviour, where hides Jesus
Why isn't he at war against us

Darkness around us was so sizeable
Black blood running through my veins
We know: what we did was unacceptable
But our hearts were by evil love chainedQuenched in a mound of snow
Double edged slayer of steel
Brazen skulls of sacred Elks
Horned cross guards, leather wrapped hilt 
Metal masters
Ancient bladesmiths
Stole the secrets
Giants beheld
Realms of legend
Where the ice dwells
There was crafted
Mighty father's sword

Oh, Suffer no guilt,
Ye who wield this in the name of Crom!

Gleaming kingdoms he commands
Roaring lions on his banners 
Savage pleasures, burning pain
But always there remained
the discipline of steel!

Gladiator,
Seaside raider
Mercenary,
thief and killer
Sworn to tread
Hyborian empires
Under the heels
Of his sandaled feet

Oh, Suffer no guilt,
Ye who wield this in the name of Crom!

Kneel to the sword of Crom!

Oh, Suffer no guilt,
Ye who wield this in the name of Crom!
Suffer no guilt, he who wields thee
In the name of Crom!Crawling through black space and time
Great worm of Cythrauls putrid heart
Eternal feaster of men
And gods alike

Bloodied maggot from the stars
I summon thee
Suck my enemies into the void
Rise!

El-Worlds collapse into the astral plane
Unspoken entity
His coils ensnare mortality
Crom-Cruach!

Unite - Tribes of the Earth-Goddess
Danu - Embrace our fallen corpses
Carnun - Horned God, all witches' father
Sun god Lug - In thy raging face we'll gather

Skyclad - Warriors enter battle
Daemonkind - Be baptised by shining metal
The Goddess - At dawn her face be stained in gore
Morrigu - Crow of War

Despite - our grim intentions
Defeat looms - by foul spawn from far dimensions
Ceridwen - Deathmother sheds a lonely tear
The timeworm's shape - Rises on this battlefield of fear - No!

A rotten musk tickles my face
All my blood was shed 
Is this finally
Death?

As I get sucked back to Cythraul
Carrion for the worm
Earth's denied of any
SoulThey rise out of the ashes
In the burning sky
No hope left for the remnants
On this endless night

War is its name and it binds you
with chains of thunder
Only the brave will defy
Seeking death before disgrace

Stormclouds casting dark shadows
On the fields of death
Phantoms ride on the black winds
Soldiers of unrest

War is its name and it binds you
with chains of thunder
Only the brave will defy
Seeking death before disgrace

Remember the heroes, the battles they lost
Alone in the darkness, their spirit rises

Remember the heroes, who died for a cause
Again into darkness, they fight to death and beyond

Daylight, the battle still rages
The combat is high
Warstained soldiers of hell stand
To the final fight(Instrumental)There is a child sleeping near his twin 
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind 
That dark angel he is shuffling in 
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair 
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair 
Her green eyes blew goodbyes 
With her head in her hands 
and your kiss on the lips of another 
Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world. 

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
Nobody ever came 
Nobody ever... 

I feel afraid and I call your name 
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain 
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another 
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 

Ah do you meet the one I love 
and smell the one who loves you 
Dream brother, dream brother, dream, dream
dream asleep in the sand with the ocean washing overHeretic - All blood runs red
Heretic - You fall from grace
Heretic - Road to perdition
Heretic - Blood blurs your vision

Already dead - You will faint
All your regrets - Are well deserved

Heretic - Blood blurs your visionFeel the sands cursing them
Blowing disgrace to find your own way
Face the pursuit
One by one, is chosen by your sin
Temple in ruins announce the sentence
Face your memory falls

Dressed in black the plague shows for what it came,
A rotting smile in a dead face

Hear my suffering, far from the lands,
into the shores
Where the deads call my name
Beyond the flames of despair

Flames of despair burn every soul alive
Waves sweep the Earth, drown your dreams
In a silent cry, reign of death begins
Annihilation of mankind
the only way to subsist
Solitudes of a new world are painted in grey

Flames of despair burn every soul alive
Waves sweep the Earth, drown your dreams
In a silent cryTomorrow, yesterday-through all times past
If was the dawn of magic - forever it will last.
The sorcerer the magus, and rite priest
- About them flames the pentagram
The fire of the old
All the summon power
Through rituals they've been told.
In solitude where no man tread
They praise the Tree of Life...and the dead.
Flesh behind - astral mind
Now on flight towards
The fifth great branch of GEBURAH
Strengthened by the light
Of the celestial warrior
The five wings spread wide - outshining the sun. 
The Ritual of the Pentagram has begun!

Endless perfection of Sumerian age 
Geometrical gate of the Ancient Ones
Water and earth, lire and air 
All culminate - in omnipotent Spirit.

Sun worship, grounding the power 
Tip pointing high 
Two feet on ground 
Symbol of fertility 
Number of divinity

Turn the tip down 
Hear darkness sound  - the coming of witches
The Goatlord grins 
His facial form - burnt into the flesh of virgins.

Free Man of Cosmos
Spread your arms and legs
Step naked into the Pentagram
Become one with it - with All
Obtain mastery of Fate's call!Cold wintry night drops of snow from the sky
Last rays of light wipe the silvery ice

The cold winter night wading in the drifts so high
The cold winter night frost shines in my eyes

Cold wintry dawn drifts frosty frown
Crunching beneath my feet sinking in my mind deep

The cold winter night wading in the drifts so high
The cold winter night wading forever moreOh my majesty
Where is your diamond crown?
Did you bring it back?
From the bloodstained ground?
Are you satisfied?
By the things you have done?
Let's give up the game
Now it's the time to run
Chorus:
Now what's your next
target to open fire?
Lightning and bombs in the air
Send a rocket at a place you desire
Cause your god is not fair
See the iron birds
Dropping downloaded steel
Hear the awful sound
Which is preparing to kill
You've decided wrong
Trying to change the whole world
Blessed by your god
Now your action beholdSee my face...
See my skin... 
See my eyes...
They won't see see, I am blind!!!

Lost the face, lost the faith
My culture, my blood, my ground...
Where do I come from?
What's my history?
I forgot who I am!!! 

Kneeling down in front of this whore: "Zion"
Let the anger recapture control. Take your gun!!
Fuck this subhuman slut!!!
Bastards deserve to perish by war lust!

I piss on your promised land!
There's no ground for you on this place!!
Peace you shall never find!!!
Your god is a lie, such is your life!!

White Warrior, my friend, my brother!
You were filled with blood and honour!
Ancient Gods, sons of eternity
The future is on our own by unity!

Lost the face, lost the faith
My culture, my blood, my ground...
Where do I come from?
What's my history?
I forgot who I am!!! 

The red sea won't open the march this time
Cursed by persecution you will die
Star of David and is illusions are falling into dust
While in Thor's hammer we definitely trust

I piss on your promised land!
There's no ground for you on this place!!
Peace you shall never find!!!
Your god is a lie, such is your life!!

White Warrior, my friend, my brother!
You were filled with blood and honour!
Ancient Gods, sons of eternity
The future is on our own by unity!

I want Zion in flames!!!
Burn these fucking scums!!!A faded yellow sky impends on a boundless granitic marsh
An immense black tower rises impossibly towards the sky
My eyes see the tower getting incredibly smaller and nearer
My smell's stricken by a terrible stench of eons of death

Everything is wrapped in obscurity
My senses are doomed to oblivion
I awake in my world, everything's disappeared
Madness and stench the only remainsI suck from the cup of old age 
Accompanied by my girlfriend Darkness 
Hidden by night I am hunting the invisible 
Through the eye of beast of prey I look at the beginning. 
My spirit is as old as time itself 
And it likes to wander among stars 
Falls through freezing universe were inspired in me 
My eyes are cold forever now 
But my ego behind the horizon of eternity 
Is seeing the grievances and is screaming. 
Burn my blood. 
Burn it, you, whose sense of living is to forget 
You, who have faithful lies and death at their heels 
And your soil gives birth to worms merely. 
Today the whole sky is dimmed by impenetrable sadness 
Red drops are falling through cosmos. 
Burn my blood.Down the mountains, and the woods
talk me in whispers.
The leaves fall in this cold autumn.
Nature is strong and beautiful.
I am resting now.
The fog advances, surrounding this lake.
A cry of Iberus.
Where hordes hide behind the peaks.
The clouds gather the storm and rain.
Rain without  more meaning than the Goddess
wisdom.
And Her voice immerses you in a dream of laments.
This is the eternal solstice which falls in tears.
Cantabria, the land of the Iabaro.
The forest where the clans rest before war.
This last autumn in the heart of men.Fragments Of a Hologram Rose
Immortalized in Burning Chrome
His success rode on ominous crest
The death of traditional SF!
Neuromancer's sequels are written here and now,
Each day we live in Example of Canuck pessimism
Examination of Global pessimism
Examination of global schism. Dystopian vision.
Forged with typewriter ribbon
Jack the chip right into my brain
Mnemonics was just a scheme
Absolution for Gibson's dream
The Faceless control everything
No heroes to save the world
No future. No history to be told.Shadows of your dreams
The thoughts that you fear
Life is a cobweb
Made up of your guilt


THERE'S NO ESCAPE
NO TURNING BACK FOR YOU
FROM THE DESERT OF YOUR SINS
THE MOON IS RED, THE LIGHT IS DEAD AND GONE
WHEN THE CREEPING SHADOWS COME TO YOUR MIND


So turn your back to
The face of the demon
Or take your chance and
Pay the price in blood


SORROW AND PAIN, THE SMELL OF SUFFERING
IN THE DESERT OF YOUR SINS
YOU ARE THE ONE, WHO RULES YOUR FATE AND LIFE
AS THE SANDS OF TIME ARE RUNNING DOWNIn the age of darkness Death is accepted Everyone is trapped in this hell There is no escape Except for the ultimate price of Death Disease fills the air, Your body rots, For death is taking it's time.Sueus

On shape of night skies riping with lightning 
With darkness and lust wrapped up my mind 
So as a flame embraced with darkness 
With sorrow and sadness full my heart 
As if a horn for banks full of bitterness 
With hoar-frost and ice forged my thoughts 
Of unbridled fury of winterfrost 

Over my head heavy grey clouds 
Under my legs only ice and snow 
Wild ice - waste forged with frost 
Where govern and ruler frosty strong wind 
Gods drive me with path of destination
through this raw land of mighty frost
Lonely I wade through ice and snow 
Slowly oneself with ice becoming 

As if a night sky torn lightning 
Soul has with torn anger and hatred 
So as a black wraps up grandeur of bright flame 
My mind wraps up lust and darkness 
like a horn for banks full of bitterness 
My heart fills sadness and sorrow 
Of unbridled fury of winterfrost 
With hoar-frost and ice forged my thoughtCyborg from the future comes to kill 
Primary mission he must fulfill 
Iniciate target kill John conner 
Machines will rise and rule forever 
Dressed in leather he'll kick your ass 
Kill everyone who stands in his path 
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide 
Terminator comes to kill you tonight 

Terminator...comes to kill 
Destroy...the human race 
Terminator...built to destroy

Locked and loaded fills you with led 
Don't get in his way or he'll tear you to shreds

Terminator...comes to kill 
Destroy...the human race 
Terminator...built to destroy 
Judgment day...has begunApocalyptic forces gathered in every nation
A hair trigger on the brink of annihilation
Soon comes the day when they let fly the flaming birds of war
And on that fateful day humanity will live no more

Miles of land melted into glass
Who would have though mankind could be so crass?

Leaders squabble over who owns precious resources
Quarrels escalate til only their armed forces
Can settle these disputes to the full satisfaction
Of whichever is the one surviving faction

Cities are levelled, all the crops burn
The story of the Earth takes one last fatal turn

After the battle for material gain
A burnt out blackened husk is all that remains
All that was human is now dead and gone
Our history is over and no-one has won

Mankind is dead
What will come next?

A blackened ball spinning on through space
Nothing remains alive, not even a trace
All man's great acheivements smashed into the dust
Buried in sand and left there to rustI can hear them as they scream 
Eyes so dead without a gleam 
They are twisted and decayed 
They are starving with no aid 

Now I hear the millions weep 
I can see them when I sleep 
Trapped in hell I can't awaken 
Truly these are the lands forsaken 

Walking through the barren wastes 
The living shamble with no grace 
Famine in the wilted fields 
In life and death you will make them kneel 

Leaders treat their people like foes 
Leaving them to freeze in the snow 
Such betrayel is the greatest crime 
Our revenge will come in time 

Revenge!Cross the unholy garden
I heard a voice
I went deep into dementia

Into the depth of the night
Starless
To ascend the Serpent's throne

With anguish I veil my wounds
In flames thawed my heart
diabolical stigma

And with nothingness I embrace my sores
In oblivion

Into the depth of the night
Starless
I ascend the Serpent's throne

[choir: Sacreligium]

I have seen thine void eyes
Visage lifeless like my remembrances
Torn loose your soul like I did
Let it kindle the flame of nothingness

Stride with me like shades
Whispering my name
The stigma of decease
I shall lay on the lips of thine
This night
The dark gift of mineVisions of an unknown graveyard,
A supreme and perfect area,
Where every former soul prevails,
When roles turn into an anti-system.

I was cursed during this terrestrial existence,
I am hence praised,
We were cursed during this wordly life,
We are hence worshiped.

When human's father, falling fast,
Leaves its dwelling to those in greatness deserving.
The mortal sin remains the only covenant
To usurp this eternal place.

I was cursed during this terrestrial existence,
I am hence praised,
We were cursed during this wordly life,
We are hence worshiped.

There,humans' prayers nourish our new spirits,
Antithesis to their scornful origin!!(Instrumental)I was heard the rays of the
moon
sweeping the waters, making
a sound
like the silver threads, that
make cry.
I was Heard the rake of the
you shatter pulsants and the
purring
from the slow moon that is
crossed the night
I was Heard the shades hit
the water,
and the fluid sound of the
waves
that they flfter in the sand of
the bank
I was Heard the light of the
sun that perforates
the darkness with a golden
bar,
humming with their voice of
countless colors.
I was Heard the sound taht
lay
between the atoms that
danced
in the golden bar
It was Heard the sound of the
leaves
upon leaning on their
cushions of air,
and the whistle of the tassels
from the sallow when the
wind blew them,
and the sharp sound that the
reptants
insects proclaim on the
leaves of grass,
and the multitude of sounds
that they are hidden in the
root of the things
Oh! Heard I was the song of
resurrection that all the
seeds intone upon sprouting...Old realm, hear your sons
Cold kingdom, take us all 

 Joining in a procession of choirs
A gathering of bravehearts
Celebrating our mighty gods
To sing as one in a winter chantWelcoming the virgins fair, to live a noble life
In the castle known to all - the Count's internal wife
She invites the peasants with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads it wings, she rapes them of their blood

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

All day long the virgins sit and feast on endless meals
The Countless laughs and sips her wine - her skin doth crack and peel
But when nighttime fills the air one must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath with blood that once gave life

Living in her self styled Hell, the Countess dressed in black
Life's so distant - death's so near - no blood to fury time back
The castle walls are closing in, she's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms - the reaper turns the pageARMIES AT THE VALLEY
DEATH NOW SPREADS HIS WINGS
FOR MANY IS THEIR LAST DAY
BLOOD LIKE RIVER TO SPILL

ACROSS THE FIELDS... THE FIELDS OF DEATH

WATCH'EM THERE FALLING
ONE BY ONE THEY DIE
PILES OF SLAYED CORPSES
HUNDREDS OF DEAD MEN HERE LIE

ACROSS THE FIELDS... THE FIELDS OF DEATH(Instrumental)The trinkets of her burden
Rest within a tattered bag
See the fair Regina
Tie a vein off with a rag
A new attempt,a naive chance
To free her from her need
She left her world
With ne'er a note to read
Seek the age that peaks the rage
That purged & tossed Regina
Explore the years that bore the tears
The search for lost Regina
Spot the will you sought to thrill
To understand Regina
Wsate of time,haste to find
A wonderland Regina
The captain's bell invites the woe'd
To find a brand new way
She boards the ship Regina
In a blind euphoric haze
They chart a couse for Eden
And set sail in fearless hope
A dream awaits beyond the telescope
Seek the age that peaks the rage
That purged & tossed Regina
Explore the years that bore the tears
The search for lost Regina
Spot the will you sought to thrill
To understand Regina
Wsate of time,haste to find
A wonderland Regina
The captain spoke of perfect weather
Regina disagreed
She whispered like a broken feather
Tell me - tell me what you see
A static charge & distant clouds
Spinning as a wheel
Hear the bellow clear & loud
Tell me - tell me what you feel
The boastful howl of north winds
Whipping through her paper coat
Behold,the storm Regina
Contemplates this weary boat
Beneath the shadowed clouds
A figure rises from the foam
He came to call his fledgling
Children home
Seek the age that peaks the rage
That purged & tossed Regina
Explore the years that bore the tears
The search for lost Regina
Spot the will you sought to thrill
To understand Regina
Waste of time,haste to find
A wonderland Regina
A sudden hush replaced the violence
Edging off the fear
A voice emerges from the silence
Tell me...
Tell me what you HEAR ME
CALLING FROM THE SEA
SWEET REGINA,FOLLOW ME(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)At the end of time I feel the whispers of divine
Maybe I'm not prepared, but ancient 
towers tell me:
"welcome to the sanctuary of the kings"
Here is carved an hold prophecy

"only a warrior pure in his heart
May stop the fate that's written on the dust"

Another holy war
I am fighting for me and for all of us
And we'll never give up
Another holy war
These words will be my glory
Or the script for my requiem

Faster than light
We are creatures of time
We are just at the beginning
Open your mind
Look inside you the legend
Of kings of the immortal
They live in you and
I'll be your guide
Between your roots
You're child of this strain

Inside the darkness we stand
And we seek our life
Beyond this gate
There begins
The quest for Truth
We're fighting for the Kings

Another holy war
I am fighting for me and for all of us
And we'll never give up
Another holy war
These words will be my glory
Or the script for my requiem

Another holy war
I am fighting for me and for all of us
And we'll never give up
Another holy war(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The age of ice falls upon the land
Icewinds unleashed whip forests in turmoil

Frost, as the skies suddenly turn to grey
Freezing climate prevails

Breath of power breaks in the plains
Rage and chaos over mountains

The age of shadows spreads over the land
Icewinds unleashed beat landscapes in the night

Frost, as the skies suddenly turn to black
Freezing darkness prevails

Breath of power breaks in the plains
Rage and chaos over mountainsAwakened - forbidden dreams confess.
Burning - the scorn of what I bless.
To forge ahead correctly we'll betray,
breeching stray, effecting final days.

What was done - facing the final sentence.
Come undone - dismissed without a preference.

Revealing - while living to descend.
Reaching - fulfilled what I intend.
Behold the season of reason to believe,
expired past too late we can't retrive.

By no one - release overdue penance.
What was done - facing the final sentence.

It's come to be,
finally,
sentencing will be received.
From this plague I am relieved.

Rise and see,
finally,
grace will cease the storming breeze,
this submergence has taken ease!

Finally,
sentencing,
once it's chosen I'll be free,
stricken by reality!

Eternally,
swirling free,
envisioned gleam triumphantly,
Ongoing grace to be received...

Finally!Inclement, the hand of our
ancestors felt over them

at the final of the night
Cantabria, the Unconquered Land

with the symbol of the Nocturnal Divinity
Glory, souls of our forefathers

to leave you immortal energy fly across the skies
invencible as the power of the storm
into the heart of darkness
with furor, our North Iberian Sadness and Pride

Fortress black, strongholdJoanna Russ wrote the Female Man, she...
The greatest feminist science fiction ever written
Now she teaches class at the U-dub in spring
Joanna Russ, my science fiction queen!
Her protagonists are tough not gamine
Like Picnic in Paradise and Alyx
We who are about to salute you Miss Russ
You awaken the soul in all of us!
And Chaos Died!
The Two of Them!
Extra-ordinary People!
On Strike Against God!
Her non-fiction is compelling and frightening
You better fucking read 
How To Suppress Women's Writing!
I heard she lived in Ballard
My science fiction queen!Every sentence you say
And every desperate attempt
To draw attention hides a lie
Diseased, pathologically inflamed
Shaped by your sophisticated eloquence
You vehemently assert your devious views
Which reign over your smallness
A champion at mystification and treachery
I don't understand how you can still do this
To someone you call a loyal friend
Is it possible to listen to someone
Who hears no one but himself?
Why compromise and trust someone
Who's betrayed you countless times
I'm not gonna watch the same game
Over and over again
I'm not like them
Here's the money for your patch work
You can't overpower me
And this is not a trademark
To camouflage your indolence
How do you want take command
Without knowledge, morality, logic and rules
Just useless words and waste of time
Still the same old business while things change
Go fuck yourself
I don't know the answer to your question why...why
Why? Maybe because shit smells(Instrumental)O Fortuna, 
velut t[L]una

Semper crescis 
aut decrescis,

Nunc obdurat

J[l]udo mentis aciem. 
Egestatem, 
potestatem,

Sors immanis

Status malus,

semper dissolubilis. 
Obumbrata

Nunc per ludum

Sors salutis

semper in angaria. 
Hac in hora,

Fortune plango vulnera stillantibus ocelis.
Quod suamichi manera sabtrahit rebelis.
Verum est quad legitur,

Sed plerumque sequitur
occasio calvala.

In fortune solio sederam elatus,
prosperitatis vario, flore coronatus.
Quic quid enim florui
Felix et Beatus.
Nunc a summo corrui,
Gloria privatus.

Fortune rota volvitur, descendo minoratus.
Alter in altum tollitur nimis exoltatus.
Rex sedet in vertice

Nam sub axe legimus
hecubam reginam.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Through the years of silent sorrow
The will for another tomorrow
Has died, along with my dreams
Soon I will join them on the last pilgrimage

Carry my soul to the cosmos
and my wayward, weakened flesh to the grave
Only I yearn for infinity
There's no going back, no being saved

Death yields no resistance to a suffering existence
Devoid of compassion and full of dissonance

Death of a flickering star
Birth of a brighter sun
This flame has been stamped out
But another has just begun...

In a dream where premonition is the key 
to a vision that molds your destiny

The waves of time lapping at infinity
The possibilities out there for me will re-ignite the will to be

Should I give this life another chance?
Let the thread of destiny weave its' dance?

Forlorn wails from within leave my spirit cold
A hole in my heart, a bonding untold
So the search for another has froze to a hold
Forever, I am cursed, to wander alone...When the sun reflects on the hills
The forest dances to the whisper of wind
A sharp cry of war
Put fear in the enemies
The spears are covered in blood tears

Holy warrior of the sun
Rise your arm and run like a feline
In lakes and hills enemies will die
Their blood in battle we will offer in sacrifice

Magic spells and sacred rituals
Write in my body
The invocation of moon
Sun is my compass to the battlefield
The sawn reborn with a victory smell

Holy warrior of the sun
Rise your arm and run like a feline
In lakes and hills enemies will die
Their blood in battle we will offer in sacrifice

For victory
For our land
The forest breathes
The smell of calm

Lakes tremble
Skies turn blue
Raise the spears
In sign of pride(Instrumental)Banners of Retra and Arkona

In battles berskerk in mortal fight
In flash of swords and axes
When Perun with his Hammer is sending thunders
When panzer detachments going to combat
Where Sea of Blood is seeping in soil
Where warriors are steping in blood
Where Strzybog gales are wildest
The Sun is scorching with his heat
Slavic Warriors are clashed
Their proud banners are waveing on the sky
Their saint flags raised in glory
Symbols of Gods,ancient Heroes
Cosmic powers wich run theirs lives
Furious Warriors are attacking  their enemies 
God of War  gives them strength to fight
When snows are great
When frost is ringing 
Panzer detachment are bound in fight
Banners raised in triumpf
Rich the sky in dignity
Hundred battles and clashes
Shambles full of corpses
Wolves Warriors standig on top of pile of dead heads 
They carry their holy flags
Roaring battle songs
Savour of Victory
...banners are waveing speechless with dignity(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Looking deep down in living mirror
Don't you know the ancient was here
Something's really wrong over here
Where all of lost soul have to stay
Waiting for a day

Flying headlong swallows are maidens
Navyi cry for beauty and madness
Evermist and never tomorrow
All you've lost is just sorrow

Looking deep down in living mirror
Don't you know the ancient was here
Something's really wrong over here
All you've lost is no here

Deep down! Living Mirror
Let you out of your greasy fears
Your life is just one more
Awakening of your inner power
You know...

Living Mirror's trap for a righteous
Strange reflections ice-cold and lightless
Guess you've got that i was a liar
Now you've getting up higher
You know... You know... You know...A SAYING TELLS THAT OFFERING YOUR HAND TO YOUR ENEMY
IS LIKE GIVING MEAT TO THE WOLF,
AND TO TAKE IT BACK YOU WILL HAVE TO BIT AS ITS
PACK OF WOLVES TOO.
THEY ARE THOSE, WHO COME IN PEACE,
CIVILIZED ONES FROM DISTANT LANDS,
WHO BURN OUR LANDS WITH THE CROSS 
AND DESTROY OUR IDENTITY, UNTIL NOWADAYS.
FIGHT, FIGHT WITH TOOTH AND NAILS.
DEFEND, PROTECT YOUR OWN TERRITORY.
CRUSH, THE YOKE THAT OPPRESSES YOU.
LINEAGE, LINEAGE IS WHAT YOU HAVE.
WHEN MY EYES ARE BLOOD,
HATRED FROM THE DEEPEST.
THEIR CONDITION DOESN'T MATTER,
ONLY THEIR DESTRUCTION OR MINE.
ONCE I DREAMED THAT ALL STARS WERE CLANS,
FREE AND UNITED.
THAT THE STEEL OF ONES, WAS THE SWORDS OF THE OTHERS, 
AND THE WHEAT OF THE OTHERS WAS THE FOOD OF THOSE.
IT WAS A PART OF THE CHANGE,
A STRANGE RELIGION INFECTED ALL.
MY FRIENDS WERE MY ENEMIES.
TAKE SWORDS AND LANCES,
INVOKING THE ANCIENT SPIRITS,
SPEAK WITH THEM,
BLOOD RAINS IN THE FIELDS.I'm the one who rules your life
I hear your hopeless cries
I know all of your dreams
Feeding the flames of war
I bring the thunderstorm
Shaping the fortunes of all

I'M YOUR STRENGTH AND I'M YOUR WEAKNESS
I'M THE SOURCE OF ALL YOUR HATE
YOUR PROTECTOR
AND YOUR TRAITOR
I HAVE ALL YOUR LIFE IN MY HANDS
STRONGER THAN GODS - QUEEN OF FATE
HEARTLESS KILLER
THE LIFEGIVER

Slavery and liberty
Richness and poverty
I bring you hope and fear
You can lament or cry
But you can not defy
I'm neither evil nor good

I'M YOUR STRENGTH AND I'M YOUR WEAKNESS
I'M THE SOURCE OF ALL YOUR HATE
YOUR PROTECTOR
AND YOUR TRAITOR
I HAVE ALL YOUR LIFE IN MY HANDS
STRONGER THAN GODS - QUEEN OF FATE
HEARTLESS KILLER
THE LIFEGIVER(Instrumental)Holy spirits, gods and ancestors

(To the last breath the enemy has been slain, enemy corpses piled to be burned in honour for the fallen brothers, raise your cups and hail the fallen ones!)

Mighty celebration for the day of victory

Rest and feast brave warriors
Your fighting is over tonight
And tomorrow you shall again meet your enemies
(The battle is won, but the war still reigns until the day of great victory)Holy Fatherland

My heart beats for these forests and fileds
Where swamps,rivers and sheet of ice
My soul takes from them power of existance
Sun wraps tuft of golden cereal
Trees are green and luscious
In every hole of that fertile soil 
Ashes of ancestors
And enormity of old Slavic treasures
Native faith,Slavic Folk
Thousand years and winters
They live from this fertile soil 
This is my home
Im her son,born from her womb
Hundreds of generations spilled blood
For our Mother, to be with Us
We are Slavs,Proud Folk
Brave, tough and bold
We are warriors-farmers
We worship mother soil
For her our strain and blood
Like Gods said
Hail to you Mother of birth
Fortress of our noble blood
Homestead our spirit
We giving you bow and reverence
You are our most precious jewel
We draw from you power and strenghtBy forces unknown in agony
The light burn my eyes, revenge is sweet
The pain of thy death i called dreams
Horizons of war awaiting me...      

Hungry dusk invaders without words
Recognized true evil in the fog
Lunacy creating darkened minds
Fighting, your beliefs will gonna rise....   

Destroyer of life
In ectasy
A chant for the gods
Who veiled me
To reign in blood
Without a scream
Return to my land... infinity...

Now the cross is falling to the ground
And his church are burning in the night
With the stars gazing from the sky
Swords and shields ablazing, now arise....
  
Wisdom of brave
Look to the past
Winters of rage
My frozen land
Oh...that symbols are burning in the night...

Now the morning breaks up the night like illusions
Old stories we speak so loud far in the wind
Four swords covered up with blood
Stucks in soil
Like prayers to the iron god
(the) moon is hidding (the) sun..."I am always standing at the gate, calling out your name"

As I've heard my name
I wait in silence
Slowly I let go
But still I cling
As soon as I let go
There before me the stream
Following my name
There we are nothing
and everything
Tingly the body bares
No longer I am
The mysteries before and after
I am the book
Truth and knowledge
Now is the time to bare all
Which is written and stored
In the temple for all to read
The veil flowsSuddenly it appeared
Offering me the key
It gave me the message
From which arose the passage
A dark far dimension forbidden now and forever

A hypnotizing power
Enslaved me for hours and hours
It submissed my will
Yuggoth now stands still
A dark close dimension forbidden now and foreverCome wind, by my side.
My sin... why I ride ?

We're running over hills,
storming through deep woods,
we are using ancient skills...

...Running out of rules!

Searching nature round... we're looking down the hill,
Watching rays of light, a triumph of the will.

Grey skin of the land...
cold wind, flying sand...

Howling hordes of wolves
chilling waves of light,
it's the calm before the fight!

Searching nature round... we're looking down the hill,
Watching rays of light, a triumph of the willone time it's your time
you will have to leave this world
there is no mercy
in the eyes of death
Thanatos won't wait for you
Thanatos will be your guide
on dead man's path
he will show you the route

you have lost everything
now there is just one way

deep down into darkness
where silence rests forever
in the black vaults of Hades
there is a place for you to stay
you'll become a shadow
with no sense of being there
you will roam time and space
with no hope for redemption

being after death, it is not good, it is not bad
it is just being like it was on earth(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The wind calls from the east
And the trees speak in their mother tongue
My homeland, my place where my kin will rest
To be here is all I need

Echoes deep in the valleys
The wind like an arrow through the trees
I see my kin in the distance
My only strength the only memory

Serving under the High King
I protected the realm for many moons
By sword and by spear
The armour of the self
My son will follow this path
Till the end of his days

And what do the gods have in store
What legacy will be left?
My home, heart and kin
To play a part to a damned end

My love for my wife, my heart for my kin
My sword for my land, my spear for my king
And at the end of my life legacy and all
And the fires are burning still
In great halls celebreation is heard
Orghlaith where great kings fell
My homeland ancient and free

Years ago in these same hills
The gods did visit us, the three races of old
Deerfolk,  Menfolk and Swanfolk
My father died in a great battle
On the strangest shore and most barren land
Wandering I found him
Bleeding up against a rock
I took his ancient spear
For victory
For memory

And without all what am I?
This land is my blood it flows like the rivers
Speak to me the pulse of the land
My homeland and my heart

My love for my wife, my heart for my kin
My sword for my land, my spear for my king
And at the end of my life legacy and all
When the trees speak in their mother tongue
When moon harks to an infinite glow
The lands of Orghlaith will know
My homeland ancient and freeStorm of hell breaking the silence of the night
The skies roaring his merciless sentence
Scaring those of the false faith and commiseration
Those who tomorrow will know the death, the end. 

Our soil claim for enemies blood
THe wind awaits for the dance of the swords
While the frightening laughter of the witch
Echoed in the ears of our enemies.

Their destiny is on my bloodstained blade
I already feel the smell of blood shed
And hear the screams of luckless enemy 
And see my brothers euphoric celebrating our victory

I see our triumph and the Foe's defeat
Through the eyes of the witch 

The practice of ancient secret teachings
The visions of thhe unholy ways to triumph 
The wisdom and ancestral glory 
Revealed by the ablaze eyes of the witch

Foolish rivals ruled
By empty believes, senseless
THeir god just exist up 
To meet my thirsty blade 
Their cries for mercy
Like a Carol on my ears
Filthy scums succumb at our feets

Wherever there was war, she was there
Morrigab, a raven goddess of war
Reveals us the future, through your eyes
A cloud of blood moves over the sky
The soil is red with the enemies blood
When Morrigan chant their song
A battle cry louder than
That of a thousand men
THat decided the fates of war
And fortune of warriors 
Reveal us the victory
By the witch eyes ablaze.You climb the rainbow as you've
done it many times
Diving in the ocean, hoping to
escape from crimes
You think that you can win the
sadness and the pain
While sticking a rusty needle
searching for a vein
Wasting your time with dreams
which are falling too low
You've fixed the whole world
under your personal law
You're a naked king with
thousand of toadies around
But your pierced body is decaying
down to the ground
Once you were a lovely child
Now they all treat you
like you're wild
Chorus:
Empty frames
are replacing your mind
The main theme
you will never find
Sail away to your promise land
You built your dreams
upon a leaking hand
Dark clouds of hell
cover the only one truth
Some well-dressed men get richer
by your wasted youth
You're begging around
just to buy an expensive lie
Your spirit is dead
your body it's gonna die
Lies, lies, there is not paradise,
ugly creature all of you
Lies, lies, in the name of God,
you've been lost it's the only truthLying on a ground full of entrails,
knowing it's the last chance to feel your sword,
fighting hard and bleeding for your homeland.
No-one will say that your blood was spilled in vain.

They will sing a hymn to your glory,
carry your remains on defended ground.
Blades will guide your march to your fathers.
We stand here sending you a last resounding Hail!

I cross the sea and all my doubts vanish,
the hails behind fade to shades.
The eternal hall of my ancestors
opens the doors and welcomes the son.(Instrumental)If fear still thy heart hold close to the fire;
the harvest moon rises and burns as the pyre
Mock not the ancients, invite not their curse;
misfortune or mirth do they hold in their purse

Samhain

When Summer greets Autumn and green turns to gold,
when the barn is well laden stray not from the fold,
when Morrigen circles, her fortune to bring,
for does death treat the beggar more lightly than king?

Samhain

Summer's gone, the sun is dying;
Winter draws so harsh and cold;
gates of Hell stand wide and open,
forgotten realm of days of old;
hope-fires burn caressing moonlight,
tongues of flame lick the sky
Within the circle of the ancients
the fattened calf prepares to die

The forest sleeps, awaits the Springtime;
Beltaine's fire will bring new life;
await the passing of the Winter;
await the dawning of the new light
You want to know what holds the future;
you want to know of hope or fear?
Beware the swords the gods are speaking,
some things you may not want to hear...

Choose well thy words lest folly be thine
Choose well desire lest suffer in time
Choose well thy thoughts be less fleeting than rain
case the gods to thy bidding when they walk at Samhain

today I banished the cursed deity
Soon to be forgotten,
Soon to rise under a different name
Still we fight the plague
An ancient dream to find true luck
was replaced by a modern nightmare
reality was never so clear
yet there still were some mysteries
But the right questions remained unasked
they were well protected by the human mind
Our ancestors take their secrets
with them to their graves
how could it change the world ?
What evil spirit I am possessed with
that I reject my will to help
I do nothing else than watch
and see the world burn in pain
How can this ever be saved ?
The solutions are worked out in every detail
However it all will remain theory
A little hand contributes against world's fall
Now, it's not up to me to open your eyes
convince yourself with your own ideas
share them with others respect their choices
even if they compete to yours(Instrumental)I feel through the ancient sunsets 
I feel through the wind and the trees

and a fighting family 
I loved my family 
and my sword.

I think of the day I will die 
I know my path is destined 
I trudge it with a smile 
I laugh with the beautiful children 
I cry with the wrinkled hag 
I cry... 

Heathen yes we are 
Heathen yes I will 
accept what we are 
Heathen through our death 

I don't need your salvation 
This god is not for me 
I once had the girl and the hillsides and a fighting family 
take it as read despite what you said 
I have no need for change 
I cry... 

Heathen yes we are 
Heathen yes I will 
Accept what we are 
Heathen through our deaths 

This is my way - there's no contest 
I hail all the gods of the wind and the rain 
Of pleasure and pain and more 
I climb to the top of the hillside 
My beautiful girl by my side 
I swing my sword at the sky 
And we cry 

Heathen yes we are 
Heathen yes we will 
Accept what we are 
Heathen through our deaths!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)This is our cradle, we must not hide it,
And everything bad ever have to delete.

And forget the previous fight with windmills.

About us dirty and ghostly face,
Worthless consuming clean air and a place.
At each corner of the smell of dirty drugs,
In the name of tolerance and junkies flag.

Arise, brothers and do not give up,
Build for the enemy a final trap! Rise up,
Brothers, because we must lead, exterminate
Drugs from our beautiful streets!

While walking lightly thought the past,
And all against which we fought long ago.
Force must arise from the ashes and dust,
And given again the final blow.

Where the moon is shining and wolves are crying. 
He stands in the middle of the forest, 
And watches the powerful beautiful night. 

A warlock with a defending pentagram 
Walked to the middle of the forest. 
To receive the blessing of the mighty werewolf. 
To infect his blood by the lycanthropic touch 
Of the forceful night beast.

A forceful night beast.The plague is near the city
a lot of bugs and beast too
Find out the horror you are living
only one hope left...!
The seven plagues live of destruction
the lugubrious ambient is which you are
gonna feel
without life these you
only you wait for your DEATH!!!We had grown like trees
From the underworld
Where our father Dis Pater reigns
Creator with forging hammer and chalice in hands

Listen to the whisper of the trees 
Standing on the graves of our fathers
Arriving the world of spirits, 
They spread their roots deep into the earth, 
A place where we all come from and where back then

Forest is a holy cemetery of our forefathers
Whispering shadows roam in the dark groves
Trunks with disembodied eyes stare into the night
And gnarled tree branches sway without breath of wind

I lean a hand to bark and I feel its awe, pulse of living heart
The flow of words and images streams on me and through me, 
Like waterfall
I lay down on the earth, I close eyes and I feel as I take root

The oldest oaks still remember what was hundreds years ago
As lunar shadows were turned in dances with spirits of cold lakes
As great sorcerers of the past rose on stars to thrones of great lords in skies
As silver lightnings opened to people a flame secret, and gods wandered on the Earthwith reckless hate we crush the throne of reason
with persistant ignorance a new order reborn
expose the death of billions through us the way of suffering
ignite the fuse of rebellion through us the path of pain

the true nightmare visions of bloodshed
a dying nation awaiting annihilation

the true nightmare visions of bloodshed
a dying nation awaiting annihilation
as it is written to build up a new world
destroy the old

no dawn for resistance a march for freedom
under a banner of chaos

no remorse
blind faith till death

the true nightmare
ignite the fuse of rebellion
through us the path of pain
a new order reborn
revenge

the legions assemble the skies paint crimson red
no dawn for resistance a march for freedom
no remorse

his ride forth kills my heart
in this pain we shall...
as we curse towards the sky
to the way of suffering

as it is written as it was rebornin a bed of fire
my brothers are burning away
with the northern wind
their ashes will fly along
through a blinding mist
my elders turn into dust
melting the snow beneath
fulfilled will be their lust.

how many lives will you take away?
how many souls will raise into the sky?
oh wheel of time.

the wing crossing on trees will sing forever
for those who only fight with pride
the light will heal broken hearts
for those who stand against our fight
shame will deeply burn minds away
for those who left their home behind
regret will finally be found
for those who once cowardly turned back.

life can crush down like the snow
falls off a tree
the time keeps going by as a stream
flows out.

horizon reaches as far as
the ravens can fly
so why should a man wither away
out of the light?- SWORDBROTHERS -

Now, that so many years have passed
As a blank figure I stand, In front of my destiny's tale
And I see a divine impaler, reaching for my soul's vein 

"Come my messiah I await thee 
for my time has come to finally meet
my Swordbrother"

A past full of pictures and greatness on my back
It's a shame to die without blood on my hands
So I bear my sword to the ground and I prayed

On cold winds of hatred I ride
from the darkest depths of hell I march
the great horns of battle call me again

An ancient oath I swore in the past
A bond of a sacred promise

Souls shine like steel, across the rainbow
In front of the golden hall, I stand still
And before tears drop down from my eyes,
I grab your hand to get you back, my Swordbrother

Bonded by honour and blood we are one,
Brothers in battle and death
Warriors in armours of shining chromed steel
Strong and immortal we soar

Ride on my warriors fight proud victorious
Onwards to battle to slay and killA foolish man believes
that he will live forever
If he from fighting flees
and lives the coward's way

When swords and spears remain silent,
the serpent's venom still runs strong
as they conspire in times of peace
the thread of your life brittles

Old and weak you have grown
A disciple of the pale Christ
An insult to your ancestry
You are a coward for eternity

The way of the cross you have chosen,
Your pagan soul was drowned
A harmless baptism they called it;
they murdered all you stood for

Your body is fed, your spirit choked
The gold they offer comes at a price
You may be alive and breathing
Your essence died a long time ago

Ideals and comrades you betrayed
to consort with the foes of your folk
We may have died a long time ago
Only to be accepted in Wuotans halls

And now you die the straw death
Despising the man you became
Maybe alive for a little while longer,
You are a coward for eternityVenus et Adonis
(music and lyrics by Rhaa)

Venus et Adonis heri vesperi ferociter pugnabant et semper hominum cogitationis vincetur, cave!

Nemesisis vindicta!

Venus et Adonis heri vesperi ferociter pugnabuntur et...

Adonis... Adonis!
In tenebrae... In tenebrae!
Venus is crying damned by the past and the blind
Stultitia... Stultitia!
Adonidis... Adonidis!
Though the mankind is blind I shall never see the black and the dark

Lux et Tenebris...

This is the requiem for the mankind tossing in the basement...
When the scars of the past are stronger than Atlas.
You cannot die, oh Venus, open your embrace, touch me, 
dance with me the waltz of the hopelessness...

Vae Victis!

From the throne of the eternity
I saw the memorial fo the damned
No penance for Venus, no pity for them
Die in disgrace! Poor human race!

Venus et Adonis heri vesperi ferociter pugnabant et semper hominum cogitationis vincetur, cave!

So die...
Red Orchidea...
Although you were in all minds are speared 
upon the voulge of time 

thoughts run upon upon the edges 
esoterica is as bile(Instrumental)Dies atramentum, dies illa solvet saeculum in sanguen
Pontus euxinus a viscus oblivio
Vacuitas ultima linea rerum est
Ad majorem anticosmos gloriam

Nullus deus, nullus sathanas, nullus humanitas, tantum vacuitas

Manifestatio bellum sanctus versus humanitas putidum ad victoria nihilumAs I stand at the Temple at Sounion
I gaze upon the sea
Behold the throne of Poseidon
Eternal, wild and free

(break)

The wind blows, holds secrets
To the ancient war methods
The Athenian fleet burned
The Persians at Salamis!

Apollo's sun burns bright in the sky
As I journey in the heat
To find the gates of fire
Where 300 fought off thousands

(break)

Their bronze still shines in
The glream of the sun
The Gods in the ancient sky
Witnessed the might of the Spartans

The spirit is one with the blood
The ocean, the sky and the sun
Hellenic war spirit, conquerors for millenniums(Instrumental)Our life is a neverending party
Disorderliness on the verge of crime
Gallons of booze
Throngs of cheap sluts
And hearbroken naive admirers
I'm hitting the rock bottom
And soaring into euphoric heights
It's better to die young than grow old
They want us to assume responsibility
For their own benefit
Yet they don't realize we don't need them
The wolf's loyalty cannot be turned into lamb's meekness
I am a bohemian and this is the fuckin path I've chosen
In the high sea of time I have sailed all the way here
And I will go on, further than you can imagine
Look, I do what I please
And I dont care what they think
They don't dare to do it cos they're not up to it
They would love to knock me down
Yet they cant defeat me
And they won't even succeed long after I die
I will always do what they expect least
Its like sifting grain from the chaff
Pigs don't know what pigsty is
Just like people don't know what life isIt's my destiny
My release from this fuckin' world
No humans... No memories from this chastetic world
Death is my vision
I'm dying... I can feel my death vision
I fly like a dragon as the speed of lightning
Over mountains and majestic waterfalls
I see a world that not exist
A world without humans
I hope this view is the of mine
Life is just a chapter
I will soon leave this earth and enter the eternal winter night
The quest of immortality because...
For the world I am blinded
My hate is your spirit and your hope to conquer
A thick mist in a cold Autumn night
Lies on the ground and devour the environment
A moonfog makes the infernalAlone in the gloom
Her fear whines
A song to the dark
She shuts her eyes

In shadow they wait
Untiring gaze
Breathe her lullaby 
Bloodlust ablaze

Chorus

Alone in last light
The dark things awaken
Voices speak
Reason screams forsaken 

Razor shines
The end of these horrid dreams
It shines
Night's angels rise

Pressed to windows pane
Foul grins stretch wide
The window latch fails
Death slips inside

 
Covers drawn tight
Her whispers cease
In darkness they stand
Flash their teeth

Chorus

Across the floor and to 
the bed
The quiet fall of tiny 
feet
They gather near and 
strain to hear
The quiet song she soft 
repeats

Across the room and 
down the hall
Parents sleeping, quiet 
still 
Now wake surprized to 
claws like knives
Demons hiss, the bright 
blood spills

Chorus

 
Butchery done
Her plea complete
Breathless she sighs
Foul thirst replete

Blood wet ghouls 
entwined
Coiled in her bed
They sleep until dawn
On sheets of red 

Chorus 2xFullmoon Asbath

Spill the cursed wine
In the Fullmoon Asbath
In the lunar shine
Witchcraft superiority

We're the children of the Goddess!
We greet the Moon in our sacred grove!
Mother Moon gave us the Power
And Knowledge of Witchcraft!

In the night of Fullmoon
We gather in the dark forest
Where our horned lord reigns
Kernunnos and his spouse,
the Goddess-Mother

Under the night skies
We praise your sacred lunar light
And shining raging bleeding stars
Pure pagan pyre buring bright in the night

At the top of the mountain under the marble moon
Hidden in the deep sickets, we dance in circle
Against the moving of the Sun,
We are naked and soiled in blood,
Weaved in united ecstasy of cursed wine of our Goddess

Spill the cursed wine
In the Fullmoon Asbath
In the lunar shine
Witchcraft superiority

We stand around near
A rough sacrificial stone altar
Crowned by the bleeding heart
And chalice of wine,
In the middle of red clouds

Our god with cervine horns merges
In exciting ecstasy with our Mother
He sates by himself the insatiable moon
Which is in a zenith of the beauty and attractiveness
We write our pagan names in the Book of Shadows

Spill the cursed wine
In the Fullmoon Asbath
In the lunar shine
Witchcraft superiority(Instrumental)Tapping the enigma of a feverous and wrathful soul
My journey through the brooding storm begins 
Awakened by a newfound fury...I tried to reach the star
The brightest one in the sky
With every night I moved
Closer to my dream
Until I found myself
Right here on the top
I worshipped the beauty
And touched...
Touched the burning star

I'm passing into anguish
Falling into the abyss of pain

Emptiness closing in on me
Pain and sorrow - my only mates
Obsession is killing me
Star still shines so bright
But I can only watch it
From distance

Passing into anguish
A wish that never became real
Passing into anguish
A dream that never become trueA solitary raven flies in circles
Above the fog shrouded field
Where lies a dying warrior
His blood sinks into the ground
As he honours his mighty foe
Who has vanquished him in battle

As the first rays of the sun rise
He will not die alone
As the embers of his life burn low
A horn can be heard in the distance...

From a storm battered sky
For blazing chariots ride
Hailing the dying mans spirit
As life severs its final ties

Into the realm of Asgard
They carry the celebrated to here
To the halls of battle slain
With a sword in hand he will go
To feast and to fight
Until the final day
When the brothers and sons of Odin
Into Ragnaroks final cataclysm shall march(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Ablaze
And glorious you stand tall
Unbowed despite your fall
And stalk the lamb, your prey
'Til Armageddon day

I obey you - my dreams are soaked in blood
In union - we'll slay the sheep of God
Archangel - my heathen heart be thine
In glory - my lightbringer shall shine

You are eternity
Thy blazing majesty

On Lilith's bosom - I'll rest during the day
Moonblessed Hecate - guides my nocturnal way

Out of the woods our legions rise - And I will beat your drum
An antichristian revolution - we'll purge the hallowed scum

Son, I appreciate your longing for me, and I'll accept
When time and space collide, in darkness we shall rise
So prepare - this joyous battle lies ahead of our hordes
The smoke will clear - victorious we'll prevail

My flaming master - fulfilled my dearest dream
Sweet Satan - Rebel most supreme
So join me - Lucifer, Astaroth, Samael, Baphomet
Belial - Baalzebul, Asmodeus, please guide my way

Unfurl my banner, raise my dark sword - and don't be afraid
My trusted servant, herald the hymn of one ablaze!

I'll be your shadow, the nocturnal stalker, your enemies I'll slay
My dreaded deceiver, my lewd and sweet tempter, the fiend I will obeyDoom is in your hands 
Black doom of the world 
Cry of Jesus Christ 
No more deceive the truth 

Most people live 
In their own fall of doom 
Cry of Jesus Christ 
No more deceive the truth 

I got to know god 
I got lucky doom 
I god well mind 
I am the God 

I haven't experience of 
Fall of doomOnce I believed 
that you were light 
But now the darkness 
is your guide 
You killed my soul 
without a fight 
You drove me 
to the other side 
Living just for 
a judgement day 
And waiting for my row 
Who's really come back 
from the other side 
I would like to know 
Chorus: 
Living by a miracle 
Death is the meaning of life 
Short time for a little stroll 
Love is the edge of a knife 
My body is laying 
my spirit it's up 
Am I dead or I'm just dreaming 
You've done so well as always do 
Making my heart stop feeling(Instrumental)The one who's sitting on the highest throne
imposed the punishment before I was born
Sentenced to death

The one who reigns over the rest
sentenced me for eternal anguish and pain
Nobody imposed me what to do,
nobody imposed white kerchief on my head
Now it's too late. Sentenced to death.

I am the judge, I am executioner
Sentence has just fallen
Now I am waiting for the day
When I won't cross the kerchief on my eyes
Kerchief is black and I am sentenced
Sentenced to death

Although I am still alive I am dead already
It's a transitory condition
Between actual death and moment of sentenceBazen behin leku bat, guztien artean erregina

THE LAND OF FIRE (English translation) 

Once there was a land, the queen amongst them all 
and sun was the king in a tale of memories 
everytime I wander lost, it becomes my compass 
everytime I search for peace, my footsteps will lead there 

(CHORUS) 
The land of fire is the land I love 
as there is no equal throughout the wide world 

Fire is my blood, heat is my strength 
in the valleys of my land I shall find life 
the heartbeats of its men are always honorable 
in the one and only homeland for all of its offspring 

(CHORUS x2) 

(FINAL CHORUS) 
The land of fire is the land I love 
as there is no equal throughout the wide world 
the land of fire is my graveyard 
an everlasting new birth after deathI see the sun, 
a burning mask of despair. 

Clouds scrape through an ashen sky, 
a besotted funeral procession 
seeking lost horizons. 

I drown myself in smoke, 
watching my own mask 
in a mirror of torpid waters. 

Whispers and bells 
bespeak dreams of misery. 

I would hang on in 
quiet desperation, if 
it meant one more day. 

Dreams of you are 
buried pale 
in long and haunted sleep. 

I despair the withered shadows 
of memory. 
I await the cold morning.I was there, in that time, with my anger
Many words, from my jaws, which were painful

Why did I say?
Why did I shout at you?

You were there, and you cried 'cause of my words
And your eyes, and your eyes were drowned with tears

Anger and sorrow
Feel poison in my heart

Why are the people sometimes like a storm?
Why do we say something that is so wrong?
Never can take back these words again
We must live our lives with them

Why do the people have to do it again?
Why are we unteachable and mean?
Never can take back those words again
We must live our lives with them

I want to change myself
I want to lose my bad memories
You can't turn back time
But you can clear your mind

I want to change myself
I want to steal her bad memories
You can't turn back time
But you can help her mind

Cry, don't you cry
Save your mind

Save and don't you cryIn taberna quando sumus

Riding together in the battlefields
Will be, more strong
We defenders of the ancient faith

Will fight until the death
The wrath of our ancestors
Will return in our heart
We aren't lamb of the one God
We are hungry wolves to revenge

We have been waiting for a long time
But the day of vengeance has arrived
I hear the call of the gods
The battle will be soon

Attacking their prey like wolves
We warriors of vengeance
Will spread destruction
Of all Christianity

Like the beak of an eagle
Our weapons
Will rip up the enemy

The black ravens eat the crimson bodies
Blood in the wind
Death in the airMy blood runs cold, my heart is silent
Rumours around me slowly fade
Clouds are forming and going away
Circadian rhythm won't lead me today

Searching a way out of this nothingness
The ultimate ride to escape from reality
Senses are fading, emotionally numb
But no salvation until it is done

Standing on the edge I look back on my life
Fearing the moment that's bound to arrive
How will I know what to do
How will I know what to say to you

When all is done
The ever-returning stench of existence
Smacks back in my face
The empty void that is humankind

Standing on the edge I look back on my life
Fearing the moment that's bound to arrive
Not knowing how or where to go
Ignoring all thoughts emerging from the past

Never will I take part in this carnival of lunatics
Never will I recognise men's fate
Only one though that conquers the mind
The ultimate ride out of this misanthropy

My blood runs cold, my heart is silent
Rumours around me slowly fade
Clouds are forming and going away
Circadian rhythm won't lead me today
I will not break, I will survive
Crossing the bridge between nothing and life

Standing on the edge I look back on my life
Fearing the moment that's bound to arrive
Not knowing how or where to go
Ignoring all thoughts emerging from the past

Never will I take part in this carnival of lunatics
Never will I recognise men's fate
Only one though that conquers the mind
The ultimate ride out of this misanthropyThe Abode of the Gods Where Dwell the Brave Fallen in Battles The Warrior Only Victory Or Death by the Sword On Palaces of Gold The Glories of Eternal Life With the Gods

In the cold forests
Battles of blood are fought
The hordes queued plan the attack
Deep within our warriors lies the thrill of death
The enemy marches to battle

In the deep silence of darkness
From the Shadows of the earth
The battle for command
Power flows through our swords
Under the moonlight the pagan blade shines
See the flaming arrows
That cross the battlefield

Blood in the wind, death in the air
Warriors march for the battle

Raise your weapons, fight with glory
Retake the pagan throne

The final blow, blood in your face
Your body dilacerated in battle
The final blow
In your hands the blood of enemies
Your body enters a pit of flames

The wolves are fed the flesh of enemies
Bodies thrown into the pile of remains
Rotting corpses
The smell of death spreads everywhere
Death has come to the noble warrior

The enemy fire is still present
The black mist blurred vision
The eyes try to touch the stars
But the clouds are too gray

Inside the certainty of victory
In his hands the blood of the enemy
In the game created by the Gods
They decide who should die

The fate belongs to the gods of war
Your destination is the fervor of battle
Dying for your kingdom
Enforcing the death by the sword

His brothers are waiting on the other side
To celebrate the eternal life
Raise your swords noble warriors
Hail the gods of warSay your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed,
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never landMuscles break the waves of the sea
Keeper of our homes and ships
Seagulls scream up in the sky
Echoes fill the morning rise
Sailors' song, so warm the breeze
The wind behind, our oars in ease
The sun is red, the day begins
Awakening of the archaic kings

Giant creatures of the sea
Dancing all around our ship
Waiting for someone overboard
Hungry for his flesh and soul
Gods under the sea they crawl
Still they have mercy on us all
The sun is red, the day begins
Awakening of the archaic kings

We feel so small inside this world
This freedom that has grown so old
Secrets still uncovered sleep
Trapped under the waters deep
Passionate mates have tried to see
Lands that they will never reach
The sun is red, the day begins
Awakening of the archaic kings

We kneel to the olden gods
Offerings we brought onboard
Prayers from our restless hearts
Cleave the air and reach the skies
Sailors' song, so I warm the breeze
The wind behind, our oars in ease
The sun is red, the day begins
Awakening of the archaic kings

In this morning
Hear me callingPray Satan, pray Satan, pray Satan... 

Satan fertile 
Woman\'s egg 
Need to cut 
Her own skin 
Son of Satan 
Within womb 
Need to cut 
Her own skin 
With a razor 
Spells a word 
Within the chest 
A single word 
Carved in deep 
Through the skin 
Bleeds the word 
Satanic Blood 

Pray... 
Satanic Blood 
Satan... 
Satanic BloodAnd then
I was instructed
About secret pathways
Connecting the worlds
Mutating
The interactions

A possible curse
Accessible to a few
In the darkness
Of an astral place
We were taught in silence

What we saw
Was hovering
Above the abyss
And yet the three of death
Was not mentioned

There was a meaning
In these revelations
There was a mission
I forgotCalm and clear
In times of old and new
Yggdrasil breath od too I am
guardian of the now except what the universe gives
that everything in your lot
weather challenging or simple beauty is for the best

What you give to life
is what you get
but do not expect
remember that because you give to one person
that what you have given them
may come from a different source

Blessed are those 
That bless others

Sann LoftSway, boughs sway
Contortion of pinion arms never still
Sway nightsky away
Flesh draped on scars and crippled will
Rasp of rusty brace and rotting grins

Mouths like wells
Rise bottomless blame
Retch blood and shame
Throats scoured from his name
Wear her skin
And sink, willing to drink
Black skim
From a breast of virgin

Dance the weepers way
Dance, drowning white branch
Shriveling roots, roots slaver wades
Dance, in gangrene trance
Pursued past your days

Tread weepers way
That only dead could sailI wanna fuck you with a chainsaw
Is your cunt very wide
If not I'll make it wide
Bloody cunt
Bloody chainsawDusk's angel weeps
Black tears fall
Sickness uncoiled
Light, too bright to stand
Retching I...

Chorus

Sleep - again, in clean white linen
Needle draws thread tight
The last stitches hiding the light

Inside on fire
Pain takes all
Hands are so weak
Cloth, hide me from sight
Silent I...

Stitching still
I lay here
A burial shroud
The last gift to myself
Please can I...

ChorusUpon the mountain among that emerald ledge
which behind the rigid footholds of the circle old,
A tattered spirit in that sphere came to a demonized throng,

And there, haunting by the stench of the deep
throws outward the cover drew the abyss,

A cracked tomb encased by embalmed granite
rests under the glistening glow of the star,
On that tomb-a language of dead gardens grew under the cosmic streaks,

Idly past the commands of the twilight
that the sad and weary apparition still constraints,

A tear from the heaven above descends
from the skyward tomb-and the stars weep the sorrow,

A darkspell cast upon tomorrow
from the rocks engraved visions of monumental season,
manifest dark mist through the crystal night we been gifted
that silhouette given wounds to the jackal neighbor,

"Violence can be done the deity,
who himself a shadow among a nested taint
doth enough empty cries from the nebular skies
proceeds a reasoning of a tempest of ethics"

Haunting below that heavenly roof above
sits patiently for the dawn of sorrows,
And the Stars Weep the Sorrow!

 Death metal had its pure form
 So easy then amongst global friends
 A bold scene never to conform
 Changes set in, pollution begins
 Despicable developments
 The duty to return and make all traitors burn
 On to your knees and repent

 Vocals so poor, like frogs in a moor
 Guitars like clouds of fruit flies
 Where's the bass sound, drums hat don't pound
 Hear how our iron church cries
 They don't give a fuck, just collecting bucks
 Acting like statues on stage
 Our final call to all those false
 We summon thou bastards to rage

 Deathhammer

 Writing the pages, lasting for ages
 Restore purity that once was
 Deathhammer bloodstained, death will die again
 This is our doctrine and cause
 Chapters demanding, episodes ending
 Delivering the death metal bill
 The years of the leech, finished as we preach
 If you won't face death we will

Fighting side by side with the shells of brothers
In the veins of warriors flows the pagan blood
In the fields only the strong prevail
The Glory
Retaking
The Pagan Kingdom Rises

The Glory
Retaking
We Bastards came to fight

The heat of the battle was left behind

Remembering the brothers who lost their lives

In songs and dances at the moonlight path

Tonight we drink their epic wars

The Glory
Retaking
The Pagan Kingdom Rises

The Glory
Retaking
We Bastards came to fight

The gods gave us the power of steel

The fronts were never overcome

Bleed the weak and the strong prevail

Honoring the victory of the ancient blood


Pagan Pride!FORGOTTEN KINGDOMS

UNDER THE ASHES OF A KINGDOM
THE ANTICHRISTIAN FLAME BORNS.

WE ARE THE KNIGHTS OF DARKNESS,
THE HATE THAT WE KEEP IN OUR HEARTS...
WILL BE THE SIGN OF OUR RETALIATION

MY SOUL REMEMBERS
THE PAIN OF THOSE WARRIORS
THAT DIED FIGHTING FOR THEIR GODS
AGAINST THE FALSE CHRISTIAN FAITH.

THE MOON IS DARK
AND THE FOREST, OUR HUT,
WHERE THE ELEMENTS AND DARKNESS JOIN UP.
(REMAINS OF THOSE FORGOTTEN KINGDOMS).

THE LARGE BRANCHES OF THE GREAT HOLY TREE
SIEVE OVER US.

NOW WE ARE UNITED,
WE WILL HEARD THE ANTICHRISTIAN CALL,
RESOUNDING AS THE SONG OF THE NIGHT SPIRITS,
NOW WE KEEP TOGETHER: ARM WITH ARM, FIRE WITH FIREComing through the empty sky
Cracking branches and dead leaves
A trail of blood
Resound of a horn

Orion in rise, Hunter's moon
and your fate is sealed
your soul will be engulfed
Resound of a horn

Join us and ride in the Lake of Blood
your soul will be forgotten
Hear the call of the wild
Join us and ride to the Wild Hunt
One fate time one bind
hear the call of the wild

I am the one, chosen to follow
I am the howl of a spear in the night
I am the wind, the last breath of Autumn
I am one of you, I'm the Wild Hunt

The season of blood
Winter is upon us
Ride in the night
Hern by my side

Orion in Rise howl to the skies

Taste the scent of blood
Resound of a horn!

Join us and ride in the Lake of Blood
your soul will be forgotten
Hear the call of the wild
Join us and ride to the Wild Hunt
One fate time one bind

I am the howl of a spear in the night
I am the wind, the last breath of Autumn
I am one of you, I'm the Wild Hunt(Instrumental)Sigurd stood strongly while meeting his doom
The Immortal
Fafnir the wyrm roared so loud
As the sword fell

The hidden path
Into the land of gods
The ancient bridge
Of which no mortal knows
The road to Midgard
The land unknown by man
Lone silent witness of all the worlds end

Guarded by Heimdal stand in the mist
Biforst, the god Odin's bridge
In ancient mountains between their peaks
Where gods walk down to Yggdrassil

Son of nine mothers, may your sight not lie
When the time comes, Gjallarhorn will bring fear i their hearts

The council rode forth when doom walks the land
Greae Trees ashes
Thor  wades through rives, the Aesir will ride
The path of fire
Heavens bridge burns all up in flames
Great hooves pounding
Their path will break and the sons of muspell
They will die

The hidden path
Into the land of gods
The ancient bridge
Of which no mortal knows
The road to Midgard
The land unknown by man
Lone silent witness of all the worlds end

Link to the gods world a colorful road
Seen only by great eagles eyes
Will lead the giants to end all of time
When the hour of Ragnarok comes"The child must be sacrificed
to the supreme spirit...
The god of the sky !"

A sacred ritual to Ingvi
We celebrate his birth
Out of darkness and death
For he is the son of Wodan
Blackening ancient pagan forces
Immortal thou art
We heathens still live on
By the dark powers of the past
We shall always be...

Ingvi guides our souls
Through time and space
At last we shall reach Asgaard
For your glory
In the past we have died
Now we are in the hall of shields.If you give a gold coin,
or your girl gives me a kiss...
Barman: bring me a beer!
I will play my violin!

You all know my song,
I want you to sing.
With some beers,
I will get drunk
and play my violin!

I jump on the table,
I want you to dance
and sing, and fight,
and drink, and yell,
I'll play my violin!

If you give a gold coin,
or your girl gives me a kiss...
I will jump on the table
and I'll play my violin!When I'm Alone. I Know You'll Be There
You Whisper Things I Don't Want To Hear
I Can't Stop Your Voice. I Can't Say Goodbye
Oh Everyone Knows How I've Tried

I Can't Believe The Pain That Puts Me Through The Night
These Whispering Riddles Want To Take My Life
No End In Sight. There's Ringing In My Ears
All These Riddles. I Wish They'd Disappear

I Stay Awake As Long As I Can
If I Fall Asleep I'll Be Yours Again
It's Hard To Tell Whose Voice Is Real
These Riddles In The Dark Are All I feel

You Tell Me You're Right. I Don't Know If You're Wrong
But I Spend My Life In These Padded Walls
God Only Knows How Long It Will Be
Before These Riddles Let Me Be
Let Me Be.Frozen iron graves,
Above the sheets,
An empty heart,
Makes its way through the fields.

Magnificence, vast emptiness,
Landscapes on hold, beyond the reign of death,
Magnificent, landscapes clear and bright,
From now on, forever winternight.

Warm breath rose to the nightsky,
Myself covered in a coat and fur,
And the landscape, buried under the shining sheets,
Lay sleeping in motionless silence,
Above all, the silver light,
Embracing the eternal winternight

The leaves have finally faded
And the farewell tears have dried
In the piercing coldness,
Leaving the silence

The wooden shacks, barely visible,
And the tree tops, in a frozen crown
Under the merciless beauty,
At which I gaze in admiration

And in this moment
I stand alone
And proud beneath a hole in the frozen ground,
Destined for me.....Screech the ghouls of deepest wynter 
The wolves howl as I prowl the perimetre 
Cursed with negative maegen wounds 
We search our servile souls. 

Tears rain like blood from Thunor's sky 
(leave) grief bleached bones behind. 

Here the stars are many..... 

Smash through wooden shield like snow 
Our swords will cut with Woden's words 
Weep and ask your god for help 
Upon your virgin lips. 

Tears rain like blood from Thunor's sky 
(leave) grief bleached bones behind. 

Woden... Thunor.... Tiu..... Freo 

Heed the call of the Aenglisc gods 
Heed the call of... 
the screech of deepest wynter ( repeat)(Instrumental)You feel the emptiness inside
The routine has become a daily burden
You can not hide

Get up! Enough to live a life in vain
Everyone has the meaning of life
You must to fight again and again

World in Your Hands
You can change it
It would be better
Don't give up! Obstacles in your way make you stronger
Don't let them drive in a remote corner

Remote corner!
Don't give up!

Prove enemies and all who did not believe in you.
Bind up their tongues. Make them change.

And soon you will notice that life is more interesting
Not stopping half way, the joint efforts
We will create a pure world

Leave laziness and inaction for other
Explore new opportunities, it's contribution to the future
create a culture.
Everything starts with small steps, turns in a great affair

Break all doubts!
Leave it in yesterday!
Day promises to be a good
It all depends on your mood 

finally you will see open gates in life
open heart give you all what you want
finally you will see open gates in life
open heart give you all what you wantA world has been built
Where pictures speak
To the longing heart
And to the weak
There's a method to
The madness that we've earned
Hope placed in statues
We'll watch the world burn

Never trust
False belief
Never trust
False belief
Symbols fan the flames of hate
Therein lies the danger
Encouraging devout belief in pain
Trusting the voice of a stranger
Placed on high beyond reproach

The sins of man
The promise to absolve
Find the truths
We are all searching
For a path to walk
To bring us meaning

Never trust
False belief
Never trust
False belief
Symbols fan the flames of hate
Therein lies the danger
Encouraging devout belief in pain
Trusting the voice of a stranger

Symbols fan the flames
The ignorant mind believes
Twisted, they pray on faith
We will feel the fires blaze

Symbols fan the flames of hate
Therein lies the danger
Encouraging devout belief in pain
Trusting the voice of a stranger

Symbols fan the flames of hate
Therein lies the danger
Ancient deception
Wrapped in bronze and silver
Carved from wood and stone
Delivering false power
The stories of old
That bind all mankind
Something that once was pure
Has now put us behind

Symbols fan the flames of hate
Therein lies the danger
Encouraging devout belief in pain
Trusting the voice of a stranger

Symbols fan the flames
The ignorant mind believes
Twisted, they pray on faith
We will feel the fires blaze
Never

False
BeliefHope one day you'll find the way
Exits to nowhere show you remain
No hesitate to suffocate spilling blood
Like a strong river stream down through your face

But my fears have gone by
and all that remains is a darkened sky
I begged the gods to breathe
a sign so my pain will never be shown again!

The blade touch your skin and hurts my heart
From my honour I face the worst battle
Against my will I defy the lie
I defy the enemy by my side

Breathe my friend, can you see who am I?
I'm the dark, the one who gave you light
I'm the one who put out my hand
And never let you fall in the abyss lost

Hope one day at the other side
All the good things in memory will weight
You will recall to rise and fall in your own loss
Yesterday you were my friend
Today yo will die by my hand!

Hold yous sword,
make your last sacrifice
Hear the sounds of steel echo in the sky
Agfainst my will I'll kill
Fall on knees and give me my Glory

This is the last breath of the dying one
One day my friend, until the end
Today the only who stabbed my back
This is the last desire of a man
Who broke the oath
Be my friend again
at the other sideI can't write, my hand is tremblling 
I won't forget, i won't forgive
Before it was not this way, i didn't know the pain, 
i didn't know the pleasure, i didn't know anything

What am i looking for?, it will be something real?
How can i feel?, only a sign
How can i know if what shine is gold?
How can i find something if i don't know what i'm looking for?

To leave my body, to fly and forget, 
to leave everything and never return 
To be as air, to escape from the pain, 
i live between shadows and angels

"To understand i can't, the universe birth
You only doubt, you won't know the truth"

A silent art!!!Cursed...
...Black magic night
We've been struck down
Down in this Hell
Spells surround me day and night
Striken by the force of evil light
The force of evil light

Cast...
...Under his spell
Blinding my eyes
Twisting my mind
Fight to resist the evil inside
Captive of a force of Satans might
A force of Satans might!

Fighting the curse
Break it I must
Laughing in sorrow
Crying in lust!!!

My strenght slips fast
Soon I must fall
Victim of fortune
My sources grow small
Life slips away
As demons come forth
Death takes my hand
And captures my soulThere is a monster deep underground
Nuclear warhead and steel
It's full of wires the iron hound
It's always in for the kill
There's no thinking just plan to ruin
Warplanners worship the death
The global murder is what he needs
The whole world is to be craze.

Everything that you love and adore
T'will destroy instantly
Living in dream of final world war
Entity of steel and hate
We don't need to ignore
Power & Reason

Nuclear warhead Reactive heart
Created only to thrill
Somebody's dreaming to press the start
To break the peacemaking seal
The mind is hidden nobody knows
The temple of holocaust
The final countdowns to final show
We know the reason is lost

Everything that you love and adore
T'will destroy instantly
Living in dream of final world war

Power & ReasonI'm sporting grins
On mourning's morning
I cut through the veils with my laser lens
Have no fear of the dark
Have no fear of the cold
I'll pick you apart,
As your life unfolds
Feeding masses with the lies
Public national spy
Wreaking havoc with my evil eyes
Through the camers
Those evil eyes
Watching through the lens
I slither past your bedroom window
I'm coiled to strike
When you're least aware
No fear of your guards
No fear of the Law
I'll camp near your yard,
To reveal your flaws
Feeding masses truth or lie
International spy
Wreaking havoc with my evil eyes
through the Camera
Those evil eyes
Watching through the lens
There's blood on my hands
Though protected by latex
To sift through your garbage
Exposing your trash
I feast on your waste
And survive on your refuse
Content to flex context
Of it's content for cash
I capture your children
And feed on their innocence
Skilled in my aim
That I shoot straight & fast
Rewarding my sources
With Hamiltons & Lincolns
Hunting for skeletons
That hide in your past
I'm watching you wasting away
Watching,waiting...
I'm watching you wasting away
Watching,wasting...
I'm watching you wasting away!Navalnic traznet despica zarea 
Nori catraniti imi asculta chemarea 
Crapat di cer, puhoi va sa verse 
Pre munti inalti, padurile dese. 

Vaiet de uliu vantoasele-aduna 
Ropot de ape pe creste rasuna 
Pacla-n amurg se strange in ghemuri 
Voci de stramosi razbat peste vremuri. 

Crapat di cer, urgie, napasta 
Cumplit prapad din zarea albastra 
Lacrimi de jale bolta-cum cerne 
Inghitite de glie, spre pesteri eterne.Sodomize the fuckin' bitch I know sure
After 7 th evacuation on her little arse
Nip the last draughts of your wine
Bore the soft cunt with the 20 cm. broken flaskThere will be a day I will meet you again
Then I will take you into a dark pit of mine.

Ripp!!  Your clothes off, lick you tits kiss your fear-full cunt.
Fear in your eyes.
Thinking of horrors that I am going to do with you.

Yess!!  Holding my dick before you.
"No, Noooo" Please don't!!
Shut the fuck up bitch.
Oh she is screaming terror and pain.
Now I am taking her so hard between her legs,
oh!!  Fucking her,
Aaaarrggg - spitting my diabolical sperm in so hard that blood floats over my horny and bestial dick out of her cunt.

You're sick, you are insane!!! She screams in my face.
With a sick smile and an evil... evil mind I am planning to kill her.
I will take my rusty dagger.
I am cutting-ripping her skin.
I am possessed by demons, blood lust full finally armageddon -
Gore... gore death triumphs.
She is dead.They are coming with the grey fog
When darkness falls all over the land
They are appearing from nowhere
When night shadows begin to spread out

Crossing the gates of this dark place
Hearing their chants in the winter wind
Freezing calls deep into your heart
From this land there will be no escape

No longer man but animal
You feel your nature is transforming
As you enter a mysterious world
And slowly your heart is emptying

You are welcome in the court of the king
For as a raven you walk
Corvids fly all around in a turmoil
And you are part of the horde
You swear allegiance to a strange crow
Protect and serve him you must
An undefined and weird body with giant wings
The ravenlord

You dark guardian of my dismal realm
Your black mates you can trust
From human beings you have to keep it clean
No one must harm our den
Take their souls and bring them to me
They are a so vile folk
And I will send them where they deserve to be
In nothingness

One day we will expand our realm
Beyond the frontiers of these woods
Conquering the world is not a dream
And we will prevail for goodConfusion in my head 
Devoured by insane brainwave 
Flashes of squashed dead 
Unbearable visions rave 

Reign of inner pain (4x) 

Ego broken by humiliation 
I seek for peace of mind 
Only haunted by hallucination 
Wishing I was blind 
In my eyes, shining blood 
In my heart, corroding blackness 
In my brain, destroying thoughts 
Merciless reign of inner pain 

World of escalating decadence 
Yearning for cruel vengeance 
I avoid the burning daylight 
Hunting my prey through the night 

Can?t discern dreams from reality 
Life ruled by perverted phantasy 
Can?t endure this wretchedness 
Plunging into craziness 
Eaten by terrible pain 
Sinking in endless desolation 
Around me, inconceavable disdain 
Incurable spiritual devastation 
Inside my grieved skull 
Millions of razorblades cutting 
Suffer from devilish bloodpoisoning 
Infected by a cryptic cult 

Kill me before I hurt you 
Dying by mental torture 
Hurt me when I?ll kill you 
Agony, my secret pleasure 
In my eyes, shining blood 
In my heart, corroding blackness 
In my brain, destroying thoughts 
Merciless reign of inner pain 

Reign of inner pain (2x) 

Surrounded with relentless intolerance 
Can?t find any relief 
Captured in a sphere of violence 
Have lost all my beliefClouds of plague
Cries of help
Lowered flag
explosion of hatred!

The veil of smoke covered all around
Strangles anyone who so barely breathing

Around the traps and pitfalls
For those who are willing to fight to the end
Heroes of undeclared war
You are indestructible wall!

Revenge is justice!
Beyond the threshold we find a new home.
We see no other outcome!
The winners will be those who will protect the weak.
Put your anger into a ruthless fist!

Victory anthems
sound everywhere
breath of freedom
feeling of flying

The veil of smoke has dissipated and vanished
And we can already see a clear blue sky

Revenge is justice!
Beyond the threshold we find a new home.
We see no other outcome
The winners will be those who will protect the weak....
Put your anger into a ruthless fist!Crossing distant lands, swords on hands
Came the braves, towards the victory
Over the hills, far from home they fought
And their acts will be forever remembered


Honoured warriors, more than just men
Their fate they carried in their hands
Their legacy is what
Give us confidence to move on
For them songs have been sang
And stories have been told
Sons of this glorious land
Let your spirit lead us


On battles braves fell
But their souls still live
And forever they will be remembered
The power of the braves
Is not on their swords
Not on their strengh or on anger
But on their hearts
You may loose the battle
You may loose your life
But never, never
Let your heart freeze
Be a brave, and live forever


In their eyes we could see courage
Of men who overcame suffering and pain
For the memory of the braves we still sing
Valorous men, your souls will never dieMusic: Panos Arvanitis 
Lyrics: P. Dedes 

Missing in action, lost in disaster 
Their payment was for saving the master 
Troops of doom, 
They fought for their land 
Not killed by the enemy 
But by the world's hands 

Graves in the darkness 
Standing all high 
No one can see them through 
The spreading light 
Graves in the darkness 
What could they be? 
Mountains for madness for us to see 

Never ending journey, 
They'll never come back 
Killed with a death row the final attack 
The battle is over 
They were not to blame 
The spirits far from past 
Will always remain 

Winners and losers 
Their graves are the same 
Fighting for nothing 
This war is insane 

The sky is cloudy 
The ground is red 
There's nothing around you 
To keep you undeadDuring the nightly raids The women and children are killed Whole villages burned to the ground Not a single human left alive Standing there in fear You watch your life burn to the ground As will you and everyone you've known Now you wonder where your god is The one you've been forced to worship He has left you to die What has he done for you? There lies the weapon of choice as you stare in the eyes of the one who killed your family Then you swing your sword with all of your might Sweet Revenge(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Sun Undefeated


 We stood and watched
 the end of an era we known, era of Pride and Honour
 We watched as the eyes colours changed
 We were granted a gift, which was mindlessly wasted
 and thus forest died, and heavens vanished
 silence became the most dreadful music
 when gods forgot, and left
 our worlds, ours souls forever...

 Is this the end of blue horizons?
 Sun Undefeated, grant us strength
 so that we shall rise once again

 Swietowit lead us
 we drunk mists of night and morrow
 and dew by the dawn
 meadows welcomed us in glory
 as Mokosz walked proudly the Skies
 Jarylo gave us sweetest fruits
 Chors and Luna gave us beatiful Nights
 and Perun, watched over forests eternally

 Is this the end of starlit nights?
 our Sun was gone for ages
 but shall rise once more

 We listened to holy songs
 to their sweet melody in the heart of the mountains
 we listened to cry of rivers
 mountain clearings confessed to us
 And we have seen the wars we lost
 but also those we will yet win
 and thus we swear on the stone hammer of our fathers
 to bring the Pride and rebuild the Might once moreWalking In The Zionists fields 
this journey seems so unreal 
Blood on my Blade, You shall kneel. 

This Black sun will rise 
Our empire 
Our Homeland 
Invaded by Rats 

Through time to stone
This dream 
I am not alone. 

Towards a new dawn we March 
A kingdom 
An Empire 
Our Fatherland.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Transfixing the threshold of light I listen
To enter the eternal fire the lament of Calcines
Creatures by the black flame awakening of Sempiternal dreams
Crying out power and vengeance to the inert skies.

The most dangerous lie must be dethrone, the word of god
Eradicating thus the false path to the eternal light
Illuminating the words of all vain foolishness
The sacrificed must be chained and torture forever.

Among dead gods, among useless lumber and wreckage
Demons dancing around of the eternal flame
Realizing old ceremonies, celebrating the fall
Of the deified, marking the returns of the
Eternal Darkness!!!

I rise up in stern invasion the standard of the strong
I question the stupid commandments of god
Proclaiming the new empire of black flame
The kingdom of the
Eternal Darkness!!!Drowned in the bloodpools
Of the realm below
Incarnated into a lifeform
Like the chosen one
I am like a vampire
Leaching the life - love thy fear
A freezing breeze wanders
Through the plains of death

My devotion
Darkness, an emotion
Surrounded by
Grim portraits of war

My face - the blood
A lustful confidence
As my fate - I will reign you
See your life drain
Feel your hatred

See your life drain
Feel your hatred
Ode to Darkness

Forged from
The strong of mankind
Phantoms in daylight
Fear the coming darkness
It announces their presence

Ode to Darkness(Instrumental)Wizard voice sung faraway and the sun dive into deep oceans
Night queen is stretching her sparkling dark habit across the sky 
Volves howled at the moon theis psalms 
and stars, silent witnesses for all are going to tell 
Fantastic stories of pilgrimeges and fates of savage tribes, 
People who disappeared like dust blown by the wind 
Timeless combat of fire and ice of races and nations 
Stars turned into shiny memorials in the sky 
Their settlements became deserty covered by sand 
Countries overhelmed with water 
Many are forgotten but some still live in our spirits 
However it s over like a dream passes away 
So hear the song that have been croaking by ravens from the ages 
in autumn days of falling leaves 
Wander through the mist 
Taken by the wind.......(Corkhill)

Driving rain, pounding at steel
North winds fill the sails
Land ahead, drawing ever near
The hills are alive with fires in the night

Jorvik mighty kingdom of the north
Won by brothers side by side
Ours by fire and the meeting of swords
Jorvik, bastion of power in this land
Far we have come and long we shall remain

Across the mighty river of the north
Into condemned land
Down the road of time long forgotten
The ancient vale leads the way to the end

The cry of battle, the din of clashing steel
The air is filled with fury and fire long into the night
Binder of the wolf, this night is yours;
Let the fires burn for you
Ragnarr is avenged by the Shield Din

Jorvik mighty kingdom of the north
Won by brothers side by side
Ours by fire and the meeting of swords
Jorvik, bastion of power in this land
Far we have come and long we shall remain(Instrumental)Oh my God

I can't belive it, why is the human mind

able to create such perversities

It's so confusing to know what man's about to do.

Daily news are shocking reminding of this

horrible crime done to the innocents

Kept in the dark for noone to see, victims of barbaric intentions.

Chorus:

Can't ignore this ruthless thing. Abusing the innocents (2x)

Can't believe what's happening. Abusing the innocents(2x)

Beating, smashing, kicking, breaking, burning

and raping what's of their own blood

Incredible fact to be revealed.

What are you doing? This planet is drowning in its own mental vomit

"Torture of the highest degree"

Is there no emotion? Are there no feelings? No love or warmth?

Only brutality, gruesome horror the absolute humiliation

Sometimes given away to others to fulfill their sexual desires.

This is a sign of pure decadence

This is a sign of poor decadence

Chorus

Broken forever, never to lead a normal life, never to be free, never to be happy again (2x)

Your worst nightmare has come true

Unimaginable mental and physical pain

Takes control of your body

Cracked by the sickness called life.

Rising of hate and fear devours yourself, destroys you from within, merciless desecration (2x)Lurking in the depths of the dungeon 
Conjuring evil spells 
Locked in its chamber stirring the cauldron 
As warriors come to kill 
Turning virgins into witches 
Through black magic sorcery 
Evil deeds of malice 
No end to the blasphemy 

WARLOCKS CURSE 
WARLOCKS CURSE 
WARLOCKS CURSE 
warlock! 

Dark hallways guarded by werewolves 
Pentagrams and candlelit skulls 
Fight your way through, avoid the pitfalls 
Beware it wants your soul 
Enter the chamber with an ax 
Walls are written in blood 
The quest is senseless for when it is beheaded 
The curse will live on

warlock!The dark you feel is
the dark I am
The cold on your throat
is my hand

Lurking in the dark
Lurking in the light
I'm here to haunt you
I am your fright
The marks on your skin
are marks of my seed
And the pain you feel
is forever breeding

And all your flesh
is grass in my hands
And all the skin rots
as autumn grass
The dark you see

I rip your heart out
I am your sandmanBring mig doeden

With Hatred In It's Eyes
They March For The Battles

Noble Kings Dress It's Helmets 
The Sound The Horns To Initiate The Battle
No Smiles, No Tears
Only A Forest Of Crucifieds
Remembering It's  Defeats

The Old Legends Of The Battles 

The Crows Fly By The Fields Covered Of Corpses
They Announce Our Victory 
Beyond The Hills I See
The Giants Dancing

Those That Had Swapped The Life For The Honour 
To Salute And Commemorate And For All The Eternity 
Tell It's Old Legends Of The Battles(Instrumental)Across the nighted deeps of space
Past Neptune cold and dim
Where solar wastes meet starry voids
Is Yuggoth on the rim

From the wells of night to the gulfs of space
Beyond the Sun's wan glim
On gossamer wings come flying the fungi
From Yuggoth on the rim

Lost in the darkened hills where they lurked
I heard their voices coarse and grim
Whisper of space and time, and stranger things
On Yuggoth on the rim

In darkling woods, encircled, they gathered
Chanting an Eldritch hymn:
"Ia! Nyarlathotep! Who brought strange joy
To Yuggoth on the rim."

In sibilant tones they sang of Shub
Niggurath's fabulous vim
Of Yog-Sothoth, who dwells beyond
Even Yuggoth on the rim

Tomorrow they will take me there
Through spacetime's limpid scrim
Across vast chasms of empty space
To Yuggoth on the rim(Instrumental)Wandering through snow covered wildness
Into the clouds, along white pathways
Ice coated trees and freezing ridges
Through another forest alive and vital
Ageing trees whisper mythology
Freys craft halts at the gaping abyss
Yawning black anti-mass
Abstract plague
I've known total darkness and solitude
Braved the winter sea before sun rise
The sun rising while the stars are bright and the moon is full
The sky blazes red while pitched black, blended with blue and green
Encountered that which was unknown within
Knowing not what had been discovered
Bellowing curses at the gods was foolish
As I drowned without gold for Ran
At the depths of my own hel, Tired and frozen
Starved, empty, Cold memories and no future
No longer tempted by poison
To suppress desire for life, an elusive dream
Banished to despair in the depths of my own hel
Where Balder speaks to me
And when I understand, what he has to say
I awaken 
With knowledge of what is good for my kind
Inspiration and wisdom
I speak and act relevance
For glory for Odhin(Instrumental)blessed with blind faith

Drunemeton
Where no bird you can meet
And no beast dwells there

Leaves shiver there 
Without any whiff of a wind
In the bent trunks of sacred oaks 
It is possible to see 
Cruel altars and terrible faces of gods

Here dead yews come to life, 
Generously watered 
By sacrificial blood
Unburning trees are wrapped 
In a magical flame, 
Huge snakes curled up 
In kroner of mighty oaks

Here we bring the sacrifices
To the Andraste
Our lunar mother-goddess
Descended from a noble ancestry
Granting to us forces for dark arts

Here at midnight 
Among the chopped-off heads of our enemies, 
Traitors and criminals and 
Their bodies got on stakes, 
Our gloomy master with cervine horns comes
From the heart of the grove
Pleasing and frightening his children 
By his impious presence(Instrumental)Smertefulde skrig

Da vil sandhed opstaa...Sitting here by your side in this old room
Thinking of the lives and the time we left behind
As you promised to stay here by my side
Little did I know how hard this ought to be

All those dreams fade away now

Now is the time to say goodbye
Will I ever see your sparkling eyes again
Now is the time to leave the past
Still I can't believe the pain that's striking me

Hold my hand
Help me stand
Help me through this lifeCircle of Stones

Yours is this burden
The heaviest weight you must support
So keep the strength and carry on

Was a fighting man of the pack
Now his spirit will soar

Burning stone
Fire warms your deedless shape
Full of life for the rites

You are shelter for the severe cold
You are our caves and our homes

Normalize the breath, visul contact archived
Attraction to spiritual communion, beware his mask
THROUGH TIME MODULATION, HERE COMES THE WARNING
It was long forgotten, after many births
Oracles in astral
BLINDING ENIGMASHere are the beasts
The wild hordes of the last free men
Hear the rising
Hear the sons of the sacred oak
Sons of freedom
Sons of the oak
Unconquered nation
Sons of the oak
Patriots
Follow your destiny...
What has become of your nation?
Traitors and submitted masses!
What has become of your nation?
Slacks and smiling sheep!
What has becoming of your nation?
Running to his own death...
Hear the breath of the roots
The sons of the ancient nation
The arising new order
The army of pagan youth
A new age will arrive
The army of old nation is singing the song of victory
"Death to the whores of modernity"Wie kan de gloed van de zon wat schelen
als de aarde zwart is... (refrein)

Als de aarde zwart wordt
de zon schijnt nog
maar nauwelijks
de ultieme dag
vervulling van een lang beleden droom

Refrein

Genietend, moment voor moment
langzaam en geduldig
de mond gesnoerd
als een vluchtende hond

Refrein

Vooraleer de dag komt
schrijdt de nacht oneindig voort
hopeloos verland
de hemel toestarend
wachtend op ochtendgloren
dat nooit meer komt

RefreinSuddenly I began to see the reality
suddenly I began to see with
the eyes of a dead
the beautiful of the life
with the eyes of a dog
the easy that is to live
with the eyes of a religious
the easy that is allow to
deceive
with the eyes of an angel
the ridicolous that are the
humanity
with the eye of an eagle
the beautiful that is to fly
with the drugged eyes
how it distort the reality
with the eyes of a Papa
the beautiful that is to have
the world to your feet
with the eye of a politician
the cool that is fuck
with the eyes of a mother
the nost occult beauty in a
son miscarries of the nature
with the eyes of the love
blind, blind...
with the eyes of Satan
I saw all the above mentioned
knowing their virtues and
defects
differentiating the good and
the wrong
and where it reside the true
love to the humanity
and I began to observe with 
the eye of god
and I didn't want to see but
and I began to cry.I ride a snowy land
Strongly holding inthe hand my sword
Which sows death and destruction
Defending the supremacy of my race

Sacred war has begun
Hate and contempt, which overfilled me
Now are revealing
They aim my weapon at my enemies body!

Frost of our winters retain our fighting spirit
Spirit of great race and our forefathers
And we're born for victory
In this true sacred war!

I see blood on the snow -
It's my blood, which was shed
For the sacred struggle
And I know, if I fall and never rise again
Hands of those who follow me
Will take my sword...
And our aim will be achieved
And we'll gain the victory!for my father, for my mother 
for my sisters, for my brother 
I want love, I want bliss 
none believe in god, everywhere peace... 

for my father, for my mother 
for my sisters, for my brother 
I want peace, on neck necklace 
smile on lips and happiness 

you live up to one's principles 
you kill two birds with one stone: 
church and uncertainty 

undoubted undoing wait for you 
when you do not believe to yourself and truth 
I want life for all...History of religion 
Only cant and oppression 
In nomine sanctum 
Burnt bonfires of inquisition 

Clergy support of dictators 

Who carry guilt for collective murder 
For horrors, for dreadful deeds 
Who are do in the name of religion 
People, which devoted of god 
Publicly they are familiar 
That they know him 
But their deeds 
Don't testify about it 

Always, beside of the church 
Where only them can 
They deny faith 
If but bargain about fortune 
The new lands 
In the name of religion 
Fanatics, lunatics, fight 
Till last drop of blood 
Till to end, in the name of god 
They don't hesitate life lay... 

The nature, she is a force 
That is streaming in my veins 
The man is master of oneself 
The man is god himself 
I know who may, who want 
And that's why, I reach it 

I undepend of god 
Of father of saint 
I am the man 
I have my reason 
I live...!When I open the gates of the unseen
I will fall into the abyss of fire
when the day of sacrifice comes
I will know the mysteries of death

I drink the sacrificial blood
liked poisoned wine from grapes of sin
I'm the part of burning space
when men and women are the stars

The knowledge of ancient Celts
and power of tytannic thrones
these secrets will be seen for me
like drop of blood on crystal knife

There is no god in my dark mind
I'm the heart of ancient Druid
I hold inside eternal flame
of nocturnal magic

(Originally written and performed by GRAVELAND)2. Hymn of the Black Legions

Black as our souls
Rising until frontiers
In eye no fear
Black as were all
Surging against the vainglorious
We don't need your god
Believe in iron, in iron
No leniency towards anybody
Ourgrimy wind grinding down
At dawn you surrender
On floor we'll batter
From our most raucous voice
We'll scream our hymn
Hymn of the black legions
Black as our souls, as we are all
Hymn of the black legionsMagic of flames, spirit of water
Iron gods and mighty wizards
Merged and forged to make other world
Great new world, the world of steel

Hammer and anvil, muscles and force
Together they're making plough and swords
All what is needed for life and death
Our world is creating in

Sledge hammer you strike stronger
Steel you become form tempered

To be the a blacksmith is as to be a priest
You need to consort with the spirits
Play 'em and guide and hold them in hands
Great new world, the world of steel

Magic of flames, spirit of water
Iron gods and mighty wizards
Merged and forged] to make other world
Great new world, the world of steel

Sledge hammer you strike stronger
Steel you become form temperedIn the north castle
Upon the high mountain
Hidden by the Old Norse wood
High above the northsea
In the frozen scenery of Northland
Is where the dark demon sleeps
The black coffin covered in blood
The blood of Mother Earth
Her life is weak
So weak that the demon feel
Her present loss
Twilight days behind the walls
Black ravens hover
And shadows whisper the return
Of the asleeping immortal
Demon in the north castle
The castle of doom
Demon sleeps... son be awake
The fall of gods cheap origin
Demon dreams... become true
Dreams of a blackened earth
A fire storm over the earth
It's the destiny of Mother EarthClose your eyes...embrace these words I've got to say
Repressed thoughts...touches of bitterness lead you the way
Exploding pieces in my mind
Imposed thoughts...I'll leave behind
Patterns of life, a riddle to solve
Habits of life...just to evolve

But I don't want this to happen to me

Now I fall into your eyes
Now I fall into demise

Far too long I've been on this world 
Far too much I've seen the others burn
Some of them are fitting in
While other men are trying to adjourn

All hope is gone
Burned by the sun

Now I fall into your eyes
Now I fall into demise

Exploding pieces in my mind
Imposing thoughts...I'll leave behind
Patterns of life, a riddle to solve
Habits of life...just to evolve

All hope is gone(Lyrics: Ion)

Crusified by hate
Baptism by killing
Pagan sacrifice
Soul of Satan lives in Me

Your life
On My hands will be
Now I win, you see
Lord of Darkness stand with Me

Crushing of your bones
Drinking of your blood
Peing on your corpse
Ravens pecked your eyes

Now thou are dead
Crusified
Victim of Hate
Sacrifice

Your corpse
They will take from thy cross
To thy tomb !
Insects will live in your guts
Thou will Rot ! 

You loose
Your soul is lost

Now thou are dead
Crusified
Victim of Hate
Sacrifice

Your corpse
They will take from thy cross
To thy tomb !
Insects will live in your guts
Thou will.....
ROT !!!! 

And your soul
On My hands will be
Now I won, you see
Lord of Evel, be With Me!!!(Lyrics: Ion)

Burn!
Burn the church of selfish geeks!

Hang their greedy lusty priests!

Telling lies with stiky lips!

Kill all buffons you can find!

They broke his mortal limbs apart!
They want their god to serve their freaks!
This is phenomenon of kikes!

Total War!!!!!

Fools!
They are slaves of their lies!
They bring their kids to sacrifice!
War!
Crush this revel of dissimulation!
Clean the earth for new creation!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)BROKEN, THE FLAME IN THE SKY 
SEA AND RIVER ARE BLOOD.
NOW THE CLAN IS UNITED 
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER, AND OTHER.
THE GUIDE RAISES HIS HAND AND HIS CANE,
HIS FACE REFLECTS THE WISDOM OF YEARS.
THE WIND BLOWS AND HE COMMANDS TO BEGIN THE SACRIFICE,
AND THE STONES GET ILLUMINATED IN THAT MOMENT.
ALL MEN UNITE THEIR HANDS, ELDERS AND YOUTH.
IT IS THE SAME BLOOD WHICH RUNS IN THEIR VEINS.
"I DO IT FOR THE EARTH, FOR THE SUN AND THE MOON,
FOR THE FIRE, AND THE RAIN THAT HAS TO COME".
EACH FATHER AND SON, FEEL THE EVENT.
RESPECT AND PRIDE, WHILE HE SINGS.
OAKEN SHIELDS DEFEND, EVEN THE MOUNTAINS.
IN EACH SEASON, THEIR ROOTS GET STRONGER.
MANY GUIDES WILL SEE BIRTH AND DEATH,
ONLY THE FIRE OF THE GODS WILL ENDURE IN TIME.Now I'm awake
Silence has rendered me insane
I've come to join the dead,
But power comes instead...

The Ruins of my anguished past, anguished past
Only wisdom foresees to know that pain never lasts
Tortured dreams of lust and pain haunt my anguished past
I will not waste another day, for time is falling fast

I yield the strength to carry on
Resilience against the storms
That plagued my past, now I am reborn...

The scars of my journey cut deep
But I shall no longer weep
For I've reached in to mind and soul
Revelations have taken control

Fire...

Repressed pain and personal suffering
Fervid fire is what we're uncovering...

Though we carry on through grief
We journey through this life in victory...

This is my strength, my devotion
Transforming life through thought and emotion

Approaching the vortex, the omnipotent codex
The Flames in my eyes show me that it's time
To unlock the gate
And reveal to me a kingdom ablaze
Come on!

A fortress of the soul, sheltered from the winds of cold
A temple for humanity's burden, an empire built on the strength within...

This is it
Join me on my quest...

Void of my contentment measured infinitely
Voice of my essence calls to be set free(Instrumental)The far torch in sight,
Between the worlds, I roam, abide,
Force of the night,
Giving strength to depart from everything...

And out there, nowhere,
A force that made me walk
A thousand miles from home,
Afortress, too far to reach r to return.
Fading Spirit,
I went to rest on iced-over seas,
Finding home in empty plains
Yet Fearing for the summer to return.

Reaching...frozen hands,
Towards the mainlands,
Nowhere In plain sight,
Out here no direction is right,
What remains is the march into nowhere.

Hailing the winter;
I await, feasting upon thoughts,
Cursing the light
And the fate that chose may gods.

Long is the way home,
Too great were the steps I made
Until the end, until the ice breaks,
I balance upon the blade.Power of the order in multiversum
Progenitor of mankind
you gave your hand
So Fenris trusted

The ordered society succeeded
And twins became from the duality...

On the firmament the brightest star,
My path is clear
No development without war

The false ego is our enemy
A look into the foundations of life
See truth and justice
Bravery and honour

I distinguish2. Remember

Highest the mountains that grow to our side
Breathless we stand and gaze to the light
The white snow remembers thousands of years
The silent wind whispers the names of our heros
Tales has been spoken, the hearts are wide open
Nothing can stop us to choose now our fate
Bloodred horizon awakens the dawn
Steel and flesh we are off through the field

Deepest the lake we always drink from
Mirrors our faces the last time goodbye
Standing infront the graves of our fathers
We promise victory or we'll die for sure
Spears ans swords, shields and flags
We take the road, we walk our path
Bloodred horizon awakens the death
Steel and flesh we're off through the field

Years trapped between centuries
Songs that never will be sung
Sands that buried all the memories
Ghosts will never rest in peace

Fires upon our graves
Stones in cyclical stand
Ruins upon them new ones
And we are still here to call you

Whispers unchain your minds
So bound we don't know why
Burning skies clear your sights
And listen deeply to your hearts

Fires upon our graves
Stones in cyclical stand
Ruins upon them new ones
And we are still here to call youA struggle with death's embrace
Blood is covering my face again
Thick swollen lips try to ask why
Why I had never...

Long forgotten memories
I am drowned in it
The search for love led me
Through paths of abuse and hate
I'm counting

The seconds till the end
I spit out what's left inside of me
Thick swollen lips try to ask why
Why I had never...

Disguise the truth - wordlessness
But this trauma won't fade
Painful enigma follows me
Maybe I could have been
Someone

The silence before the pain
And all endeavours in vain
Thick swollen lips try to ask why
Why I had never...

A struggle with death's embrace
Blood is covering my face again
Thick swollen lips try to ask why
Why I had never...BERSERKER'S BLOOD

And slaughtering evangelization
We're the full blooded pagans
Rules by our nighty tyrant
Will we be treated like your own children,
All raped by nights of clergy ?
We'll lead you to despair
Cause our tyrant has no faith in unseen,
In unseenThe village on fire
My homestead in ruins
Men rush forth fighting
Arrows block out the moon!

Crows sing of death
To all who listen!
Warriors died on their shields
Spears cast at the foe
Too late to react, too late to know
War drums sound across the land
Horns bellowing in bloodied hands

Blood and bone, spear and shield
Fires consuming my home
Screams of anguish from battle
Revenge for my fallen brothers
Fire and ash, smoke abd flame
My wife and kind taken away!
Flickering embers on the hillsides
The smouldering ruin

Bewildering fires still burn in the night
The battle is nearly won but many have died in the fight
Remembering the last words of my kin
Lost forever into the ether...
Lost, in tongues of flame!

When all the winds die in the breeze
The village, a flaming wreck
Many lost are now free
Still searching for my kin
Lost forever into the ether
Lost, in tongues of flame(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Sky turned red
Tears in my eyes
I see the gates of Heaven
Take me up to see my Life
I need to hear my lament
Lowering clouds
The Gods I hail
I drink my wine at last time
My last breathe
I'm ready to come
To the kingdom of the EERIE...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I know that I hung
On the wind swept tree
Swung there for nine long nights
Gashed with a blade
Bloodied for Odin
Myself an offering to myself

Knotted to that tree
No man knows
Wither the roots of it run
None gave me bread
None gave me drink

Down to the deepest depths I peered
To snatch up the runes
With a roaring scream
I fell in a dizzied swoon
Well being I won and wisdom too

I grew and joyed in my growth
From a word to a word
From a deed to another deedFlying with the eagles, soaring way up high
Aiming at the red sun, warriors of the sky
Lightning strikes above us, storms are raging on

Look upon the mountains where the gods did reign
Sword of Ares shines on, ruling once again
Father in Olympus, guide our burning blades

Steeds of black with wings of leather
Diving on their prey
Souls of hell obey the master's call
Pegasus reborn in magic
Entering the fight
Sworn to seek his victory, or to die!

All hail, here we rise again!
Metal from Hellas!
Gods sing, in the land of pride!
Metal from Hellas!

Dreamers of the nightside, lost in crumbling halls
Stalking sacred ruins, where your demons crawl
Witness of the ancients, draw the secret signs

Riding mighty chariots in the arenas of the world
Launching into battle, to conquest and beyond
Mystic winds of Aeolus, fill our black-eyed sails

Crushing down the devil's minions
Through the underworld
Cries of battle fill the burning air
Here anew we swear the promise
We made long ago
Keepers of the flame that will not fadeworthy of great warrior from this harmful world
our young hero was brought up by the last old blacksmith dwarf
working slowly to carry out a perfect work
with the sweaty face, the skin tanned by embers
the hands withered with years beating white-hot iron
repairing the sword of his fallen father with the aim to face the devil at his turn.

this glittering sword comes from magic fire
the young warrior needed this weapon
to avenge his late father burned alive
he was ready to bury the dragon.

tearfully the knight went to the beast
armed with his new ally named Nothung
far he already heard the monster's howling
that'd have frozen the blood of the bravest knight
suddenly his horse felt a smell of death and ran back
and anxiety grew in the young man's heart
the confrontation got ready he couldn't turn back
he didn't know he fought for the last time.Kneel before me
Show no face
For the flames in my eyes
The giant flames burn dark and deep
Red the bleeding, the blood streams

Blood Von

Kneel before me
Show no face
For thy cross awaits thy healing
Punishment... yes
Thou soul shall staple
For I kill those to be punished

Blood Von

Kneel before me
Show no face
For thou blood tears show thy suffering

Blood VonWe grew up full of boldness
Unaware of our own ignorance 
We kept in mind our goal
To live for something more

But how were we to know
That we are betrayed by our lords 
The ancient gods of chaos
Persuaded them to sell us

The lords are dull and greedy
The gods are sly and perfidious
And they deserve each other 
Sharing the feast of suffering

Their toadies keep inspiring 
The shameful tale disarming
We are the chosen ones
Let's turn our blood to dung

It's honorable they say
This fate is best for mortals
Prepare to give yourself
To make the ground more fertile

Chthonica...
Chthonica...

Enchained and sentenced
I'm lying defenseless
And gazing at the uncaring sky
How proud should we be
If our destiny is
Eternal self-sacrifice

The sky plays dead
The stone turns red
The ground will bring our daily bread

Alliance with the ether
Was gainless and dissolved
The depths became our patron
In trade for blood and souls

So then began the new age
Of fear and outrage
The self-sustaining system
Perverted pride of victims

The deity of soil
As ugly as amazing
Is growing from below
The hecatomb is rising

Chthonica...
Chthonica...

Enchained and sentenced
I'm lying defenseless
And gazing at the uncaring sky
How proud should we be
If our destiny is
Eternal self-sacrifice

The sky plays dead
The stone turns red
The ground will bring our daily bread

We grew up full of boldness
Unaware of our own ignorance 
We kept in mind our goal
To live for something more

But how were we to know
That we are betrayed by our lords 
The ancient gods of chaos
Persuaded them to enslave us

Enchained and sentenced
I'm lying defenseless
And gazing at the uncaring sky
No grumble, no hope
No way to elope
And throughout is the eternal chthonicaThe lush valleys of my sacred land
Vast lands washed by crystal clear waters
North shine the palaces of stone

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

The shadows of night brings memories...
Elders tell stories of achievements
Our wives and children toasting the bounty of our fields

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

I give my soul to the gods...
In return we pay them back with the spoils of war
I will give my life for my homeland
The blood enemy sow our green fields

Our hands are destroyed to handle swords
The torn flesh by the power of steel
The distant eyes reveal the horrors of war

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

The duty to love and defend our land
Will always be passed to generations to come
In harmony with the forces of the earth

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

I give my soul to the gods...
In return we pay them back with the spoils of war
I will give my life for my homeland
The blood enemy sow our green fields.Evil wrath

Strong as ever
Growing hate
Rising higher
Open wide
Spit forth fire

Silent churning
No control
Of hatred burning

Eyes on fire
Must unleash

Arise like steam
Reaching higher
Free at last
A storm of powers

As she came in & found me dining with the king

Torture her, torment her lake her life 
She's dreamt of it for such a long time

To die in pain Suffer
Razor tongue cunnilingus
Obscene nightgown death
Deep multiple river shining red in the skin

She folded her lips around my weapon & took the shot

She was sweet but her taste was damn sour 
My five winged heart sent her down below

Now the flames are licking her 
The flames are licking herIf you want to imagine how the world will be in the future, picture a boot stepping on the face of a weeping man.

Power for the sake of power!In the Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Camerinus, 
Reports of a rebellion reached the roman general publius quintilius varus, 
on his way to his winter camp.
Deciding to quell this uprising as quickly as possible,
he took a detour through unknown territory. 
Deep into the heart of the Teutoburger Wald.
 
Day after day the marching went on.
farther into unknown.
Denser and denser the canopy above.
Blocking the sun that we love.
 
Deeper and deeper into the wood.
We traveled as fast as we could.
Thinner and thinner our procession stretched out.
And no one were sent out to scout.
 
Like a river of light we ran through the night.
One by one we could all feel the doubt.
will the torch in my hand burn till the end.
One by one they were all snuffed out.
 
As the rain began to fall, we could all hear the call 
we have a rebellion to stall. 
Once and for all
 
Darker and darker the thoughts in our minds.
Fearing for what we may find.
Harder and harder to march in the mud. 
amongst enemies seeking our blood.
 
Farther and farther away from our home.
From the empire known as rome.
Thinner and thinner our hope to survive.
we will all probably die.
 
Like a river of light we ran through the night.
One by one we could all feel the doubt.
will the sword in my hand save me in the end.
One by one they were all snuffed out.
 
As the spears began to fall, we could all hear the call, 
above it all we, will route you all.
once and for all.
 
Arminius have betrayed us.
 
when the spears finally ceased to fall I found myself alone in clearing.
surrounded by comrades sprawling on the ground covered in blood.
It was a strange silence then profound and foreboding of the horrors to come.
And a feeling and the fearing that I was all alone.
 
A feeling of being observed by someone in the corner of my eye.
But when I turn there is noone there.
 
we've been betrayed,
waylaid, outplayed. 
surrounded our chance to evade now fade.
But It will not dissuade me from drawing my blade. 
 
I try to conceal the fear I feel.
As destiny reveal that my fate is sealed.
But I will not kneel and appeal.
I have a burning zeal to raise my steel
 
Romans we are under attack.
Romans we have walked into a trap.
Romans there is no turning back.
 
So is this how it finaly ends.
Faraway in a enemy land.
So few of us remain here still.
At the foot of Kalkriese hill,
we make our final stand.
 
For the hope of a new day.
Never yield and never die.
For the glory of rome. 
We'll be fighting til the end.
 
But at this point it was too late. 
They would not live to see another day.
The officers began to fall on their swords, 
in fear of being captured alive.
This was to be the end for the three legions. 
Brought to Germania by quintilius varus.
Their eagles were lost. 
Never to be risen again. 
Or to soar the skies.
 
We will sacrifice ourselfs for the glory of rome.
Our memory lives on by the bards and their songs.
We will sacrifice ourselfs for the glory of rome.
Our memory lives on by the bards and their songs.
 
Into the fray my brothers, fight till the end.
Never will I drop my sword and runaway in fear.
 
We'll stand our ground and never yield.
We are legioners and we stand strong and proud.
 
For the empire we gave up our lifes. 
The glory of rome has led us to our doom.
 
Upon hearing of the defeat,
the Emperor Augustus was so shaken by the news. 
That he stood butting his head against the walls of his palace, 
repeatedly shouting. 
 
Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions.
Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions.
Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions.
 
comrades I see you in hades when I die....(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)FOREST OF SOULS IN THE WOLF'S LAND.

THE LONG WAIT IS OVER AND NOW EXPECT THE BATTLE.
THE WEAPONS WERE FORGED WITH OUR ANCESTRAL HATE.
THE UNION OF THE LANDS WILL GIVE BACK THE ANCIENT LAWS TO THE KINGDOM.
THE TRADITIONS WILL RECOVER AND WE'LL EXPEL TO THE INVADERS.

FOLLOWING THE WOLF'S STEPS, CONFIDENTLY WE GO TO THE BATTLE.
IN THE BATTLEFIELD THE RITE WILL BE COMPLETE.
AND OUR SOUL WILL OBTAIN ETERNAL POWER,
FOR CONQUER THE WOLF'S LAND AND DRAIN THEIR BLOOD.

WE ARE THE LEGIONS OF DARKNESS SO WE HAVEN'T FEAR,
TO THE CHRISTIAN GOD AND THE TRAITORS.
WE'LL MAGNIFICENT TO OUR BELOVED CELTIBERIA,
SPREADING OUR CULTURE UNTIL DEATH.
THE UNITY IS THE ONLY WAY TOWARDS THE VICTORY,
THOUSAND OF SWORDS WILL PIERCE THE CHEST OF THE CHRISTIANS.
AND THOUSANDS OF SHIELDS WILL PROTECT TO OUR ROUGH TERRITORY.
WE GO BLIND BY THE RAGE BERSERK, WE ENTER IN THE BATTLE.

THE DEVASTATOR POWER OF OUR SOULS,
WILL UNLEASH OUR INNERMOST BEAST,
AND THE INVADER'S HEGEMONY,
WILL FALL BY MEANS OF THE EDGE OF IRON.

OUR HEARTS PUMP BRIMMING BLOOD OFF HATE.
AND OUR BODIES WILL BE THE SEED,
WHICH, FED BY OUR BLOOD, WILL GIVE RISE TO OAK GROVE.
EVERY OAK TREE WILL CONTAIN THE SOUL OF A DEAD WARRIOR,
AND THE FOREST WILL SYMBOLISE THE ETERNAL UNION OF THESE SOULS.
FAITHFUL NATURE! AS FAITHFUL AS WE BEFORE HERS.
SHE WILL GO WITH US IN THE FINAL TOUR,
BEING OUR SINGLE COMPANION(Instrumental)I tried to find my way home
I try to find my way

Lost in life, life
Lost in depression, depression

The stars above and endless sky
The endless sky

I tried to find my way home
I try to find my wayShaking Chill
Sliding past my skin
Praying visions end
Horror sweetly laughing
I can feel you
Lying
Underneath the sea
Whispering to me
Hiding under dark glass
I can feel you crawling
Crawling
Crawling
Crawling to me

Chorus

Breathing soft lies
Old flesh, old crimes
Fairy deep in her glass winks 
green eyed
Chill slipping inside

Shadows drift
Past the open door
Storm swell pounds the shore
Old gods hateful canting
I can hear you

Shifting
Underneath the Sea
Whispering to me
Waking from your long sleep
I can hear you calling
Calling
Calling
Calling to me

Chorus

Frostrime halos
Cold spray blurs my sight
Reeling in my fright
On gale swept knifes edge 
gasping
I can see you
Rising
Ascending from the sea
Exalted before me
Ancient king awakened
I can see you rising
Rising
Rising
Rising for me

Chorus 2xWhy you lost the will to fight.
And pride that is part of the glory?
Why the fear has become your second name
And why everyone talk worthless story?

Your great task remained incomplete!!!
Run the brother and do not be cold!!!
All behind you can forget and delete!!!
Run brother and returned to the road!!!

Once you bravely tread on anyone,
And follow our way of pure heart.
Once the obstacles were your life,
Battle for the freedom is the only light.

That day when you stopped to fight,
And you're left without a twinge of pride.
Everything you made fell into the water,
Halting the lives of your son and daughter.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I lost myself once more.
The irony of the sentence prior to this one is rather peculiar.
In amidst a crumbling civilization of ever-so conforming humans,
I find myself lost. 

Lost in the confusion, the facade called life that we are inevitably forced to live in.
There is no choice in life other than the choice of ending the fucking thing.I see the scene dissolving in a vapor
Our freedom won't be
Filtering the cream
My bloody fist
Has splattered on th paper
They want to show
The gift is not a dream
There,the youth is hustled by a trend
Cannot break what's easier to bend
There is no striking of a pose
We're playing the truth for you
Come your time to show
All we have is The Curtain
And The Rose
I'm not above
The mayhem & deception
I waded through
The common & the plain
You try to feel
That yours is an exception
See,in the end
The tricks are all the same
There,the old recital of the stale
Classic note that covers like a veil
There is no striking of a pose
We're playing the truth for you
Come your time to show
All we have is The Curtain
And The Rose
We hold back our anger
And sit through the ride
It won't be the blame
Of our own foolish pride
So just take in the moment
Take in the show
We take what we're given
The Curtain & The Rose
The Queen is in the balcony
The peasants on foot
The old & the young
And the misunderstood
The actor,the author
The poet,the prose
The breathless,the ugly
The Curtain & The Rose
There is no striking of a pose
We're playing the truth for you
Come your time to show
All we have is The Curtain

The riddle of the mountains of the north
Where pagan memories bleed
Of hordes that through darkness ridden
Bringing magic of ancestral rites

Ancient rites under moonrise
Ancient cults for pagan pride
For the sacred rest of the soul
For the secret of the pagan art

Oh! King of the Kings
Show us the way to immortality
The black sun born in the horizon
The master of illusion
Leads us through path of fire
The black light of the day discloses
The end of the age

In the darkness portal
Haunting voices recite death words
The age of the blood becomes true
In the old forests of the north
Over the chaos and the plague
Ascend from the ashes of time
The age of gods

The secret for the perpetual life
In the cold forests of north

The immensurable forests of distant lands
Where pagan memories bleed
In the cold forests of north
Ascend of ashes of the time
The God's age

By the sign of victory
At the old forests of north
In distant forest the power of your sword reigns
Oh Great master of war
Your name was glorified in battles
Show us through the ashes of time
The age of gods

From the age of godsI'm the one
The King of the Gods
Guardian of Mankind remember my name
Lost in a dark abyss for thousand years 
I have returned to destroy your life

I am here
Legend's back for eternity
You'll be my slaves
This world now lacks the holy force

Mortal man you've signed your own 
death warrant
In this vision, look at your damned fate:

Deadland and destruction
Around your blind eyes
Screams of sorrow
Will hurt your mind
Horror will come
With its dark wings
I'm the Darkness
Master of the Night.

I'm the only one
King of Terror, lord of Filth
I'm the only one
In my hands, your life will burn

"Fool creature of the night
Your reign is just sand"

Fantasy!
Nobody else can fight against me
Agony!
Is the only way that you will cross
My kingdom will be your

Deadland, wasteland
Your time has come and
Now, my fury will
Disrupt your soul
The wind will breaks your damned 
life like
A slight branch swept by the storm

I'm the only one
King of Terror, lord of Filth
I'm the only one
In my hands, your life will burnSo long ago 
I felt the warm touch of daylight 
(The burning sun in my soul) 
energizing my senses 
in the days when my feelings were still alive 

Now my life is fragile, so empty 

My eyes are like windows 
windows to the world that I'm looking through 
(I am caught within) 
Where is the flower? 
Did it wither or did I discontinue flourishing? 

Far too long I have suffered from the pain, 
new-lit torches were blown out 

I feel my blood 
Running through my veines 
Is it still the same? 
Am I still the same as yesterday? 

I can't get out 
Blocked by this feeling that pulls me down 
(Again and again) 
My hope is dreaming 
Of a colour spectrum enlightening my soul 

Far too long I have suffered from the pain, 
new-lit torches were blown out 

Am I different or what is going on? 

I feel my blood 
Running through my veines 
Is it still the same? 
Am I still the same as yesterday?Een slip vol humus klei en leem
En zongen de aarde geesten over ze heen

Uit de diepte van de gronden klonk kommer en kwel
Een vloek weggestoken in het bladerveld
Langzaam rijzend boven de kruin
Een vloedgolf van leven een gewekte tuin
Het bloed van de mensen vel en been
De kleinste nagel de kleinste teen

I wished my dreams would last forevermore 
I had travelled to places sweet and beautiful 
As my life had been before 

And I have returned to the cold 
The mist was slowly leaving my face 
As I was injected by pure dose of reality 
So dim and everlasting grey 

- voices - 

The voices speak to me 
They speak of misery 
A feeling from inside devours me 

I get deeper into the maze of disillusion 
Chaotic thoughts in my mind, I'm dreaming away 
Am I still healthy or insane, I do not know 
My mind is twisted, so obscure, I close my eyes 

And I won't be in darkness, you will see 
Drift away to a better place, you cannot understand 

I see you in my arms 
Feel your lips on my skin 
Oh please hold me strong enough 
Don't let me fall 

Slowly my fears are passing away 
And my breath slows down 
You are the light in my darkest days 
Never fade away 

I see you in my arms 
Feel your lips on my skin 
Oh please hold me strong enough 
And let us fly where our love wants to fly 

Finally, I opened my eyes 
I realized the stream against my mind 
I had been floating for some time 
But now I'm back, I'm so alone 

The voices speak to me 
They speak of misery 
A feeling from inside devours meCut the neck tear it with hook
See the carcass' shook
Spill seed to the cutten neck
See the maggots nice fest
Sodomize with brutality
Push cock hard till blood comes
Punish!
Pull the eyes with finger shoot loud
Maggots eat the neck
Tear and bring blood
So givin' cock to mouth
Sodomize again
As become a rotten peach
Cut puss fuck pussTidal waves, come from overseas 
 Atlantic rage is pounding 
 Silver scud, grief. 

 Inmortal currents, roaming 
 Heavily, crooked reefs 
 Grinding hope doom for all. 

 We are smaller, as we enter 
 High seas between the storm 
 And waves, thunder only lights 
 The way. 

 The land is rotten, rather not return! 
 The land is rotten, rather not return!In The Foggy Depths 
Of The Dark Forest 
A Hag Gazes To The Darkened Horizons 
And High Above The Mountains 
Black And Dismal 
Lightning Pieces The Starry Skies 
Fierce Winds Through Branches Of Ancient Oaks 
And Now The Clouds Obscure All Light 

Singer Of The Elder Songs 
And Keeper Of The Olden Ways 
She Harvest's Bones And Putrid Herbs 
That Heal And Kill 
That Have No Names 
Wrinkled Hands Dig In Damp Soil 
Unearthing Skulls 
And Precious Stones 
Earth Here Knows Her, Spirits Lead Her 
Chorus Of Crows Call Out To Her 
Her Orbit Driving As A Comet 
She Returns Again Again 
To Crush The Leaves Encased In Frost 
Walking The Paths She's Tread Before

Allfather Wotan, Mother Frigga: 
Hear My Call 
I Hear Your Voice 
In The Howls Of Wolves 
Your Whisper On The Wings Of Owls 
Be With Me On This Night 
Bless My Work, Hail!Nascut ai fost, in bezna ca zeii
Adanc, sub munte, primit-ai suflare
Iar somnul ti-e veghe de ritmuri solare
Natura ti-e sora, dand viata ideii.

Iar blana ta fost-a vesmant de nascare
Semn spre-alte sfere, celor alesi
Si-ai fost parasit, lovit de uitare
Doar pasii-i mai porti prin codrii cei desi.

Mos intelept, viteaz, sihastru bland
Stapan al vietii si mortii, in car astral
Alter-ego salbatec, in semn de pamant,
Roata timpului o-nvarti, in somn abisal.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Ready to fight - But standing far
With all their might they will start a war
All the weaponry - Soldiers are armed
Noone is free and noone is warned
Killing for fun - Raping wives
People run
Try to save their lives
Government denies the loss of men
With one big lie war's to an end
Peace is a forgotten time
Never will it be accomplished
A moment so fine when this war is finishedUnder the grey dust of oblivion
Foul by the leg of god on the cross
The bones of pagan kingdoms rest
Worshipped by their warriors
Praised by the psalms of the night

Golden force of hatred
Power enchanted in the glare
The black moon arises
To light the night of return
Reborn by the breath of abyss

Banished knights return
The pagan empire returns
Ice lies down on the earth
The dawn of the new world comes
It shows transformed face of the earth

The last battle comes with the day
On the horizon, the last warrior draws in the shadow of death
Destroyed legions of heaven
Blood permeates the earth fast
Oblivion covers the temples

Pagan warriors return with their targets
Wind spreads the ashes of destruction
The Dark Gods bless the winners
In the glare of torch, calm faces are seen
The night covered the day and lightLiberty

I want to fly high, fly high through the sky line.
Chase after the wind and glide on the clouds.
Wait for the twilight, the dawning of hope.
Struggle out from the restraint that binds me with chains.

Beware the darkness; the torment shall spread through our beloved homeland, devouring faith.
Keeping our faith in reality: Arrives the liberty.

Oh! Spread your voice in the air.
Oh! Striving for liberty.

Majority of people, they tend to live without fear.
We have the same dream of hope: Living in the life as before.
Look far beyond, we will overcome the dark.
Become a legend, lasts forevermore.

Beware the darkness; the torment shall spread through our beloved homeland, devouring faith.
Keeping our faith in reality: Arrives the liberty.

Oh! Spread your voice in the air.
Oh! Striving for liberty.
Oh! Light the fire in the dark.
Oh! Sign of liberty.

Dawn always comes after night, (Before the twilight.) lights up the shaded sky. ( The dawning of hope.)
Dawn always comes after night, (Before the twilight.) lights up the shaded sky.

Oh! Spread your voice in the air.
Oh! Striving for liberty.
Oh! Light the fire in the dark.
Oh! Sign of liberty.At the edge of ocean
Left with nymphes she plays
There's just one flower she can't touch
Yet so beautiful she can't resist

Then ground breaks
And invisible lord appears
He rapes, and takes her deeper down
To the land where the laughter is gone(Instrumental)Forever lost, endlessly untrue
All my sins I surrender to you
Drinking in the flood of laughter
Sinking through the earth like water

Trembling in your embrace
Promises hollow
This dying grace
The worm of sorrow

Ever empty, slowly fading to dust
This lurid sadness abandoned to lust
Drowning in corrosive candor 
No secrets kept, no arcane glamour

Trembling in your embrace
Promises hollow
This dying grace
The worm of sorrow

Sleepless waiting, spent yet craving anew
Murmured weakness twisting the truth 
Fire gutted sense of horror
Feel the serpent sliding under

 
Trembling in your embrace
Promises hollow
This dying grace
The worm of sorrow

Trembling in your embrace
Promises hollow
This dying grace
The worm of sorrow

Forever lost, endlessly untrue
All my sins I surrender to you
Drinking in the flood of laughter
Sinking through the earth like water

Trembling in your embrace
Promises hollow
This dying grace
The worm of sorrow(Instrumental)In the distance, the shadows appear,
intent is growing near!

Through strength we will deny,
refutation under threatening skies!
Through the trees guided in storm,
attempts impelled, creations reborn!

Drink from thy bow,
Courage will lead us in!

Through the gates, to tame the throne,
onto where we see our home!
Attempts assure intentions stern,
intimidation dies intern!

Aligning for the light beyond,
embracing firum upon our dawn!

With all concern the vision is clear,
in sight the last frontier!

On horizon the fortress appears,
interrogation under doom filled sneer!
Holding strong, pushing beyond,
crusade storms further on!

Drink from thy bow,
courage will lead us in!

Through the gates, to tame the throne,
onto where we see our home!
Attempts assure intentions stern,
intimidation dies intern!

Aligning for the light beyond,
embracing firm upon our dawn!IN THE LAND OF SUN 
MANY HISTORIES HAVE OCCURRED
LEGEND, MYTH OR TRUTH
WE BELIEVE IN OUR IDEALS
FAR FROM OUR HISTORY HAS EMERGED
IGNORING THE CRUELTY
WITH WHICH HE HAS BEEN TOLD THIS
STORY OF EVIL

THEY WIELDED THEIR WEAPONS
EVERY DAY IN THE PAST
ANCESTORS DEFEATED
IGNORING THE TRUTH
THE ENEMIES DESTROYED MERCILESS
TEARS OF THE GODS SPROUTED
A BIG ABYSS UNLEASHED
HER SONS AND WARRIORS 
HAVE BEEN HUMILIATED
AND THEY INSULTED HIS SOUL
IN THE VALLEY OF EL DORADO


HATE AND PAIN
ONLY PROWL IN THIS LAND
THE HOLY MOUNTAINS 
WERE COVERED IN BLOOD
IN THE BATTLE, THE WARRIORS 
FOUGHT WITH HONOR
FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM

FURY OF THE STORM
IN THE OLD VALLEY OF HONOR
UNHOLY ENEMIES
YOU DIED WITHOUT PRIDE
FOR AN EPHEMERAL DREAM THAT NEVER CAME

ONLY THE COURAGE,
DEVOTION AND HONOR
WILL REIGN FOREVER
IN THE LAND OF EL DORADOThe land fell and Ulin did die 
her mortal soul was saved 
three gifts borne to the land 
that turned the night into day 

Her eyes spread like fountains 
Her hairstrands like trees 
Ascending to Valin above 

There she watched Faolan 
His doomed family tree 
Sent a spear down from above. 
Valin above! 

As the mountains shook 
And the Oceans roared 
The Gods took Ulin above 
By the fire, by the sword 
By the light of Olan 
Valin above Valin below 
Into the rivers and over the lands 


When the heavens forged fire and ice 
and when they did call to thee 
there she died in the battle 
and memory did fade 

She had the gifts 
of spear and of tongue 
she became a god 
throned in Valin 
She wept for the land 
Pouring out from 
Valin high. 

Valin high!how has come the time for the war to be behind
in the season when the tepid wind blows on the barley
when the snow vanishes and ravens fly high in the sky
when the wild life reborn from its own wet ash.

the time is for me now to ride away from my constant thoughts
to go through the deep forest and the vast green plains
for feel free and unchained from my daily fears
waiting for fresh night, my glance plunges into the sky.

waiting long for the solitude of the winter
I shall unite the lands as one with me.

following my instinct, changing my expected fate
I got engulfed into the dark away from my wasting war,
lonely and bravely I shall find my wisdom into the night
riding like a wolf looking for my nobleness and dignity.Words of a Child:
I gaze with amazement
At a world without name
Beneath cloudy raiment
From whence now I came

I hear as the grass grows
At spring''s tender hand.
My heart pumps green billows
To every stem

Both:
A trouvere of a new May
In butterfly''s fane
I''m a note of the great lay
Composed by the main

Song of a Shaman:
A theme that is profound
I play at my ease
When wandering spellbound
In ecstatic bliss

I dance like a moth with my senses numb
As did my feet in ancient times
To a million souls primeval rhymes
That from the inside beat my drum

They see just a shape caught in fire-lit spree
A wondrous image in essence nude
And envy this godlike solitude
(They, who) endowed with gift of saying ''we''

Both:
Of nature unspoken we share different shapes
Of stellar sonata, of nightingale''s staves
Yet face of each other we cannot descry
This ''Mirour de l''Omme'' lies before our eyes!

Song of a Shaman:
A paradox's door-man
A shepherd of dawn
With my hands I''m warming
The fiery glow

They attribute me wonders
Of ignorance''s van
Forsaking The Marvel
The one that is ManNo vision, just a sound.
No feeling, just a sound.
No emotion, just a sound.
No thinking, just a sound.
No future, just a sound.(Instrumental)Born into the trench more than leather will be bent
Demons possess your soul now the night takes all control

Black damnation, black conjuration, black castration

The total hunger for the taste of death
The blood is dripping from your eyes
It stole your soul but it's not done yet
It won't stop until you die

Black damnation, black conjuration, black castrationAngel of darkness finished his job
He gathered his sheep together
Now they will drink his poisonous juices
From the shell of their sins
Whispers from their hearts
Tell the brutal truth
We're drowning in the sea of misery
There's no hope only fate

The winter is coming soon
With deadly forces of doom
Daemons are out there
Beware, beware...
The crime with no fear
Assassin's getting near
The victim is a man
Again, again...

Blood flowing
Blood teasing
Blood screaming
Like a madman's fury
This is the end

Forces of good on their knees
Death gives us the last kiss
Say farewell to the grave
Escape, escape...
You know you're in the trap
Your brain and mind collapsed
Drink the poisonous vine
Or die, or die...Lyric by Igniis Inferniis

Hail warriors...join us...
And come to celebrate your freedom
With blood and pride!!!

Hear we are gathered in this night
Like our ancestrals did in the past
Drinking wine and feeding with power
For later on in battle

Rising the flag and celebrating one more victory

Close your eyes and come back in time
Feel the pleasure rising again
Your sword and defending your people...

Now you are in the place
Of your last combat
Gather your ancestrals and fight
There's blood all over the ground

Mutilated bodies, fallen everywhere
An intense metal war has happened

You fought with the old people...
You've relived the age of the steel

For a single night
Your soul left your body in a trip to the past
A reunion with your ancestral ones...

Now we are here gathered this night
Drinking wine and celebrating our freedom
Rising the pagan flag and celebrating one more victory(Instrumental)Course of Old Domain

The Gods Course
Accomplished bravery
At the battlefields
For the emperor we bleed

To the Gods portal we walk
Seeking the eternal power
The Course of the old domain
The way to Valhalla

The wind that blows in the north
Show us the way
The conductor lead us to the route
Sailing always against the storm
There is no calm path in this journey
The way for the mountains
The secret for the perpetual life

The way for the rest
The course of Gods
The way to Valhalla

To the Gods portal we walk
Seeking the eternal power
Cause in bravery we believe
Our blood was glorified

Therefore in battles we suffered
For the emperor we bleed
Eternal Bloody battles were fought

Vagabond des neiges sepulcrales
Depuis les hauteurs abyssales, j'observe
Les derniers vestiges de la race humaine(Instrumental)As a bird of prey that I am, I don't care about my enemies
And falling from their ivory towers
In a pact with the nature, diving in an empty space
To empty from their memory my existence
No more consistent than any victory
Don't care about what I can express
Lamentations devoid of sense
Falling in oblivion
And all shall be clear, all shall be swipped
Ashes from a disincarnate time
To be one with garbage
Fancy for authenticity, eulogy of the ephemeral
In simplicity rest our emotions
Memory is their mirror
Tomorrow all those useless words will be behind
Live Fast Die Young
Which god my genes come from
Which sublime being that rotten my dreams
In the silent of the night
Echoes my poor thoughts
Which fortune from this disincarnate time
Ashes of history will validate
Is there an after when time gets timeless?
Impersonal place of perdition
In which my eyes stay open wide
Look behind curtain of temptation
A sweet cage where modern slaves lose their life
Eulogy of the ephemeral
In simplicity rest our emotions
Memory is their mirror
Tomorrow all those useless words will be behind
Live Fast Die Young
Ashes from a disincarnate time
To be one with garbage
Fancy for authenticity, eulogy...(Instrumental)White icy grounds for the hunters to explore
Long endless night on the core of the forest

Passing through the Mount of Bear
We've spot the prey
After tracking it down for countless dayss
Now it's taking us far from home
Unknown lands, the sky is yet colsing fast

Forgotten hole in the Universe
Far memory is our home

Ice, anger! courage to slain
Frost, thunders bind us to the sky
Wind and blizzards fighting us again
We assembled, the hunters of the ice

Merciless Thundergod, you cast your fury on us
Icy knives and lighting torn the air as we thread

The test of the hunters, and now we are one less
our brother motionless, his life was the fee to pay
Now, when your body rest in the snow
Let your soul rise up, fly beyond the thunderclouds!

Forgotten hole in the Universe
Far memory is our home

Ice, anger! courage to slain
Frost, thunders bind us to the sky
Wind and blizzards fighting us again
We assembled, the hunters of the ice

Ice, anger! courage to slain......
With my brothers in the frozen Hell....

Ice, anger! courage to slain
Frost, thunders bind us to the sky
Wind and blizzards fighting us again
We assembled, the hunters of the ice(Instrumental)written by nidhogg vom walde

Thus are creators of destruction
Carriers of my message.

Dark Conquerors, Dark Knight, Dark Conquerors.

Fight with fury & nobility; protect with scalding desire,
Your convictions of vain & intangible visions,
 Raise proudly your banner, declaring victory after victory,
Death after death, empire after empire, 
Under the devastating sign of the Black Flame.

Dark Conquerors, Dark Knight, Dark Conquerors.

Subjugate the sons of a agonizing existence
Them have been subject of the light
Will represent our victorious battle
Their blood will satiate our thirst for vengeance
Their eaten away and lacerated body will serve
As glorious banners in front of our bestial armies.

Thus are my obscure children
Beings thirsty of power & blood
ThusFlames, so close my eyes 
Blind visions, painful 
Can you hear my silence? 
a deep valley of darkness 

Damned taste of passion 
So bitter, so sweet 

The love is a cancer in the heart 
Killing slowly in pain 
Living between the past and future 
But never in present 

Hunting pleasures, burning 
I feel me so far from me 
Can you feel my cold? 
A frosted dying soul 

Damned taste of passion 
So bitter, so sweet 

The love is a cancer in the heart 
Killing slowly in pain 
Living between the past and future 
But never in presentThey have come to conquer our land
But we have killed all their forces
We stand in their blood
Up to the ground

Their heads we cutted off
And put them on our spears
We mutilated their bodies
And raped their souls

Then their ships returned to their homes
But with our warriors inside
We burned down their towns and villages
Killerd their wife and raped their daughters

The shadow of the nightly forests have been
Filled with deathscreams

We have lived by the sword died through and
Rest by his side

We have fought for revenge
We have fought in the name of the old godsAre the sins getting staler?
Does every moment move pass you?
Or does it feel like forever?
And shouldn't you be laughting too?

Take a look how they found you
Take a look what they done to you now

What was it they wanted?
Sullen and haunted?
If only you saw it, coming

How far down would you fall?
If you never come up again
'Cause you're so Sick of it All
And you wanna change everything

Just how deep would you go?
To see through it all

If you could consume her
Would you say you were finding your way out?
Is anything coming clearer?
Smashing your mirror
But still you can see, you're guilty

How far down would you fall?
If you never come up again
'Cause you're so Sick of it All
And you wanna change everything

Just how deep would you go?
To see through it all

Coming closer my composture
Turning inside out in her
Calling home, all alone
You can call, I wouldn't answer
Any question in my head remains until you feel the same
Never telling how I felt it's all I ever care about

How far down would you fall?
If you never come up again
'Cause you're so Sick of it All
And you wanna change everything
Someone somewhere should know
If you wanna come back around

But just how deep would you go?
To see through it all
To see through it all
To see through it allLight obeys the reign of dark

From the rumble of the thunder 
From the storms and rain and haze of the mist 
We were created, the superior grand nation 
We stepped up on the way to the peak 
The way led across unknown lands 
We rised milestones along the way unknowingly 
We received the fame will uncover 
The silent is past and the past is in the right 
We rose from the mud from which the world arose 
The fumes of the past fires disappeared over the horizon 
and time scattered us to all parts like a flok of crows 
Over the sparks of the fire we narrate..... 
memory amongst the the leaves blowing in the wind 
So we link together the future and past 
Like the clouds that fly over the sea 
We are the bonds that world is going to acquit and the world will go on 
Like people to their dreamsFrom the depths of a tree
The rains cleanse the earth
And all negative thought
Strays and follows it

After these many days
Of continual drought
The rains come
Cleansing the path
The pathway to golden halls

All wea is forgotten
New life, and new hope
All wawa is forgotten
And we are whole again

For when Ancient Ways return
And there is no other
Life is idealWe invoke the powers of planets.

Zeus give us the wisdom.
Mars give us the mighty energy.
Lunar give them feelings.
Venus give us the power of attraction.
Mercury give us the ability of logic.
Saturn give us the primitive science.
Uranus give us the strength of evelution.
Pluto give us the power of disaster.
Neptune give us the chaotic mysticism.
Sun give us the ultimate reign.Followed by the raven,
By rain, by wind with might.
Followed to the mountain,
To Raven-Forest-Ever-Night.

Raven the unknown being,
The mighty beating wings,
Black eyes are always seeing,
The real and unreal things.

The spirit of the black bird,
Knows to fly between water and sky.
The spirits of the black birds,
Are screaming from the halls of valhall.
Look up to the snowy forest,

Which is to see in the great white hills.
Flying down a creature to the frozen lake,
Croaking loud it is singing his hymn.
Fog is stroking meadows and the trees,

No more living are now to see.
The gliding raven is looking to his fellow,
The gods called him Munin.
Night by night the ones flying to north and south,

The other to east and west.
Odin is sitting on his wooden throne,
Hoping they will come back.
No one could ever take his greatness,

So often they had tried.
They called him bird of death
And tried to seek his might.
But they never reached their aim,

He's still what he had always been.
The bird of strength, the bird of wisdom,
The black bird of the north.His memories returned slowly, 
Deader than he had been, 
But defining in the fog of his mind. 
Thoromir, his name. Throrheim, his place. 
His enemy's name: Glamr, the high one. 
He had taken them so to the south of Vinland, 
He had condemned them, 
Only to be able to add some lines 
In his declamation in the Thing. 

Before resting, 
Before looking for his own tomb, 
He would look for Glamr and he would break it. 
He would twist his neck, 
He would pull up the meat of his column, 
He would dismember it and he would devour it. 

The warm seas had already been behind, 
And behind them had been the cadavers 
Of the sailors of every ship 
That he had crossed with his drakkar-wolf 
The infamous provisions that he had stored 
Shrank day by day. 
He adjured the waters, the winds, the clouds 
So that they dragged it more swiftly 
To the gelid north, 
Toward the snow, toward the long nights. 
He threw all the rotten leftovers, 
And he dove in them. 
The sharks wanted to add it to their meal, 
But he took the form the Ocean Snake, 
The form of Iomungandar, 
And too much late the sharks repaired 
In that was an undead. 

Thoromir incrusted his drakkar 
Against the rocks of the coast 
On earth only traveled at night, 
Razing, 
Looking for Glamr, 
Calling him loudly for his name. 
A shepherd 
In a valley, 
Admitted him 
That Glamr had returned from Vinland, 
But that he had died from fevers. 

The draugr Thoromir howled of hate.The hall is ready with ale, mead
And music, and the hearth is glowing
On the faces of those who attend
Solemnly, a man speaks of his ancestor
Connecting with him through the web of Wyrd

Sittaen Aet Symbel
A beot I read
Of my great-grand-father's deeds
Of the life he betrothed me
He cut through the flax
With his ready tongue
Sweet mead from his lips
Flowed in yellow paths

Sittaen aet symbel
Come brothers and maids

We drink!

To Woden, for victory
To Njord and Freo
For the qualities of ice and gold

We drink!

Sittaen Aet Symbel
Raise the horn to your lips
Taste the secrets behind the staves
Between measured sips
A toast to the dead
That see at the symbel
And a declaration
Of their intent in our flesh

Sittaen Aet Symbel
A gielp to the hall
Around this table of ash
That has known the nine worlds
Witness my wyrd
I will craft it to this end

One by one those attending shout their appreciation

Hail!

The Symbel is done
The beots and gielps made
A voice sings over the mead bench
And the crackling fire
Whilst those present drink to the past
Present and their futureThe autumn was sharing its pain
With valleys down the mountains high
Was season of hunger in lands
And people died like summers fire
The
sorrow was blinding their eyes
To see the hope in foreign come
They cast then the spell of betray
They did forget his sacrifice
Like morning that showed him no way
Somehow he managed to forget
But soonly the sadness took his breath away
It crushed his heart with endless isolation scarrs
He always considered the pain
To be the source of art and gardener of life
But now it is eating his flesh away
Like once he came from foreign land
Save me from the winters eves and lonesome nights
It captured my spirit with its sadness and frost
For I've never seen those shores far northen most
To rename the forest is to kill the Folk
A place forlorn
The sacred site of foreign dome
A place unknown
The site where eagles nests are formed
The autumn was sharing its pain
With valleys down the mountains high
Was season of hunger in lands
The people died like summers fire
But people could never believe
That Gods would bring this spirit back
The plague and the hunger now seemed
To reign forever in his heart
This means war...Thousand gates...Thousand gates of darkness
In the mortal world of the slaves, in the empty
Cave of the death...Rise the night in the last foray
Rise the death in these times of hatred
Frost in the forest realm. Death...into this world...of
SlavesYesterday I saw a church
in her a wall, in the wall a
door
in the door a paper, that it
said close
and a sign that said so
...with sadness appear in my
face
the terrible battles that next
to my siblings fight
the blood that I on behalf of
the Kingdom spill out
that of nothing served to
present eats up a flunky
being the son of the king
thousand books with
promises and threats
two thousand year of wait
and a man to wich the
others men
they gave you the power of
sanctifying
for that not said that this was
not a war
if not justo work of conviction
for that father doesn't tell
once and for all
and for all that we go make
we not longer want but
prophets
we want to you
for that we cried by day and
at night
for that they burn our hearts
because a tear of yours of
remorse
it would turn off this pain
because they burn of in
satisfaction
today I close our house
because there is not who visit
it
because there is not war
we didn't get tired of to fight
the enemy believes
inadequate fight for taht is
already his
today I under of my cross
I pick up my things and I
leave
who it know and they in
some place need of a god(Instrumental)cosmic invader, raiding the streets 
Fills you with fear, eradicates the weak 
Sent to kill, blades on its back 
Blood will spill, prepare for attack 

slicer fills you with dread 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer takes off your head 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer sadistic assault 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer decapitated them all 
BLADES OF DEATH 

running no where fast, blades in the sky 
Bodies split in half, every one dies 
Sharp stainless steel enters your corpse 
Fate has been sealed, he shows no remorse 

slicer fills you with dread 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer takes off your head 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer sadistic assault 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer decapitates them all 
BLADES OF DEATH 

Full blown panic, society to chaos 
Close to the end, all hope has been lost 
Annihilation, city burns 
Civilians flee from town to town, never return 

Slicer fills you with dread 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer takes off your head 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer sadistic assault 
BLADES OF DEATH 
slicer decapitates them all 
BLADES OF DEATH(Instrumental)Silent watching gaze
Across the blackened plains
Two eyes like burning embers
Awaits the moment for the
North star to blaze

Sythanagon winged
Angel rides deaths wind
To cloudless sky
And sound a summon call of war
Now burn does the skyline

Soundless wings lacerate the night
Angels of death emerge accross the sky
Thorned heads spiky limbs climb the air up high
Attack of the pearly gates
Now wait for the sign...

Seen now is His star
Ablaze now risen in
The sign of the one with
A numbeer not a name
Now given is the sign

The Golden walls of heaven

Sound is given now of charge
A voice of war does cry
The cry does sound the signal
And the walls are stormed
Now fly

Swords are drawn in soundless flight
Above the walls of gold
The winged angels of death descend
A thousand from above
Now heaven is in its' last throes of death

Sacred shrine of life and death
Apharamons gold key
The raping of holy interior
And all concealed
Now masturbated upon is throne of gold

Scattered battered wings
Along the palaces and streets
Trophy of the victory
Attached to spear of the Beast
Now spitted at is the scalp of God.(Instrumental)You're standing here, you noble lords so silent about my crime. 
And though you have put me in chains, it is you who wish to die. 
To sit beside your great divine is your strongest desire. 
And all of us who won't take your vows, you commit to holy fire. 

You see in me the devil's eyes and think it freedom's price 
I bend no knee to gods above, they're constructs of your minds 
You condemn yourselves to eternal life, and call it sacred rite 
But no, I'll keep my head held high, as you bask in your tainted light. 

There is no need to cast you down, we should be unified 
We're divided by theology, beliefs of archaic times 
So take my life and burn my bones, may the fires reach the sky 
If so you wish to murder me, I meet my end with pride. 

No matter if it's cross or star, or hammer, moon, or rose 
I will not bow before your throne, or the scriptures you impose(Instrumental)From a past life I have brought knowledge to this life
To complete the journey I am

As I am here at this gate
It is not time to enter the hall
Standing waiting for the chief
To guide the water bearer through
Here and now the flame
A  friend, a companion

I am travelling to find people of the earth

Of father I ask?
This is another
Communication, Patience, Silence.We are not alone in our universe
We are not alone in our universe
Sad songs, the way they go
Remembered for eternity
We are not alone in our universe

So step inside your wish
And climb towards the free
If all was said and done
Will all we call hope live
The marks of times long gone
Awaken you from sleep
So step inside your wish
And climb towards the free

A lifetime long we were fading
Our souls were still shapingTemptation, oh! Temptation
Temptation of Belief

The world is coming down
They follow to your God now
This plan is for this
The biggest madness
Only check out this
lauh!
The final war is more tears
And people die like this
Purakatas!
Revolution and rage together
The confussion dear

Temptation, oh! Temptation
Temptation of Belief(Instrumental)Stand beneath the lightning, hear the thunder speak to you
Embrace the wind and taste the pouring rain
never wonder why the thunder does not lie, before the storm great fire lights the sky

now the lessons have been learned
through the hills and fields they run
As we watch our homelands burn

The ill wind blows into a storm, spreading the disease
will we stand and fight with our heads held high...or will we die upon our knees?

As homelands burn no-one learns
as homelands burn our hearts still yearn...

The sky will shed its tears and the rivers will run deep
the forests cry in anger and the morning sun does weep
the moon is full and rising, its time to face the truth
the battle drums are calling...and the wind sings with the wolf

Those that still remember will speak about this land
of the time of flames and fire, the blood upon their hands
when theres nothing left but ashes and nowhere to call home
will we lie amongst the embers as our spirits walk alone?

Scarred beyond this love I have, will fortunes ever turn...
...or will we close our eyes and watch our homelands burn?Many aeons ago,
before the human race,
(the) darkest emanations
ruled upon the Earth.

There is an ancient tale
from the warriors of the west.
It tells about
a brave who crossed the vast ocean.

Quetzalcoatl!

Quetzalcoatl, an ancient god
of the extinct Mayan civilization.
He had a beard and white skin,
odd for the local folk.

Quetzalcoatl came from the east sea
and returned whence he came
promising to return.

And his final destiny
nobody knows...

Mayan, a superior civilization.
They had so much knowledge,
like astronomy, architecture, theater,
writing, magic and prophecies,
mathematics, medicine...

Many knowledge (and books)
brought by

Quetzalcoatl!

Immortal is the knowledge in those ancient books,
which came from the orient
by the hands of this brave being,
who crossed the vast ocean
to reach his final destiny.
The last (last?) of his quests.

Who really were you?

Quetzalcoatl?!From evils passed 
Evil is yet to come 
Embodied in a child 
Festers a black soul
Gradually eating the mind 
Rebirth of ancient horrors
The many-now as one!

Tearing himself to pieces
The bringer of light turned black
Man arose from his ashes
To one day bring Lucifer back

A soul so old in a boy so sweet
He mocked the ones who would steal and cheat
Pretty mischiefs were not for him
Lambs of God and pitiful Nazarene 
Such disgraceful spawn of the One so great
The time had come to undo foul life,
Soulless flesh so much to waste!

Princes of murder were gathered in him
Souls of the damned-melted to one
Patient yet strong they molded his heart 
Years to build what moments could ruin
He would trample the earth 
With death in his path 
Rekindling the light 
With each life he puts out.(Instrumental)Sea of silent running high
The wateris getting dark

Darker and darker by Blood
Shining under the moonlit Sky

Beast from darkness are crowding to the ancient lands
Restore the reign of the mighty gods

Realm of liars will decayed
His rotten blood painting the Sea
But the water cleaning the filth
Screaming souls flying down to Hell

Darkness will might again
The ancient realm rising to power
 
Paganheartds with war-axes
Will win the last battleThe eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

Endless war of good and evil
Between believers and heathens
Every story ha multiple sides
Every coin has but two

The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

The irony of it all
The winners write history
We're supposed to learn from it
But we never do

Believe and you shall find
Your search for peace of mind
The lies that you are served
Will only see you purged

The quest for the light
Will lead into the dark
One second you are gone
...you'd think there was more to life

The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

When everyone is brainwashed
Who are least in the wrong?
The propaganda of it all
The blatant lies

The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

Hypocritical masses
The silent majority
No-one dares to take a stand
Do you accept to be led by the blind?

It's time to doubt authority
It's time to question what you hear
Trust yourself, head helt high
Being bold, running wild

Use your eyes and you will see
What history has yet to see
That it's gods themselves
That are the eight of the seven plaguesMy land , proudly born from the sea
under Api's command my ancestors ruled these kingdoms,
triumphant Warriors ,
hymns to Mars ,
Infernal gods will have theyr tribute
so they will triumph in battle!

Gentium fortissimarum Italiae!
Vitulia , thy ancient heatendom rule
Sabellian Quadrilaterum , between mountains glory and honour

Amma , we breath your pagan soul!
Mamerte , Heres , lords of war
Vezkei , Jupiter , kings of heathenpride.

Palmenses - Truentum - thy wine empowers my fury
Vestinii - Pinna - honour and pride of family
Marruccinii - Theate - Achillean war-pride!
Pelinii - Sulmo - rulers of the mountains
Marsii - Marruvium - your force and strenght are legendary
Samintes - Brave against roman empire!

From Aternus river , to the caves of Ate-Tixa
many glorious deadly fights were fought
Kill the flaccid god , reborn in warrior's steel!

Nocturnal Pagan Supremacy!!

Capestranis pugnator has reborn to erase the cross
"Behold the crucifix what does it simbolizes? Pallid incompetence , hanging on a tree"

Singin'proudly ancient war-song
embraced by Amma's spirit with frostly winds
carring ensorcelled weapons of might
we run thoward the battle(Instrumental)My days are grey like dirty snow
The fire's burning in my soul
Why should I live, love dying in pain
My death is Reaper's gain

In solitude I can not tell
Just of my deepest sorrow
All time that's left is freezing me
I'm waiting for tomorrow

The fire in my mourning soul
Burns all my feelings to the ground
And all my hope has gone away
I simply will decay

Of war in mind I ran away
The chaos lies behind me
On desert plains where I can't see
The golden bright sun blinds me

No strength to help to break the spell
This curse that grinds me down
My mortal life runs out of me
I'm dying on my own

The fire in my mourning soul
Burns all my feelings to the ground
And all my hope has gone away
I simply will decayThe calm waters of a twilight.

When the howling wind
crosses through greenish hills,
bluish by the horizon,
fading to a red-yellowish moonrise.

The twilight in the forest, after a long journey.

And by nighttime, on the circles around
the bonfire,

music, drinks and food permeate stories
and philosophies of wise ancient warriors,

lonely watched only by
ancient trees
of the dense
forestWhen life ends
Take me away into your land
Where I shall get life again
I'll be living after death
When life ends
Show me the way into your land
And I'll come to see the place
Of my sepulchral inhabitance
Now I wait
When my soul will separate
From the body to the Gates
Of your Empyrial Reign
When life ends
I submiss you with all my heart
My life ends and now I start
To confess you God of dark
Now I see the face of God of dead
And I hear his voice
Now he tells me of forthcomin' death
And my time has come
Soul prepares to leave my cell
Soon I'll see the world
Of Eternal Life
I will see the Gods
There I'll taste the wine of aeon
There I'll see the lakes
Of the liquid fire
My flesh will burn in flames
And my soul will separate
Now I see the face of God of dead
When my life will end
Welcome to my burial...
All my life I was pain
Now you'll take my soul away
Now I'm dying but I smile
Yes I know this time is mine
All my friends has come to see as I die
Now my fathers are Judges of my life
Now my soul's preparing to fly far away
And I shall never return to home again
Into the forest my flesh now will be taken
At the holy holocaust to soul's awakening
Now I shall burn in the cleansing fire
My life ends and I'll get higher
I'm inviting you welcome to my burial
Now the shapes of my ancestors are real
Now I'm making the last flight over
My life ends but my way is not over
When life ends
Welcome to my burial
Now I see in infra red
Man can't realize the land
Where I live now when I'm deadThe throne of bones stands lifeless
Amidst the rotten trees
The crown of tarnished silver is
Buried in mud and leaves
The wind still carries laughter
As well as blood and pain
A tale of sordid slaughter
And pleas cried out in vain

Chorus:
By traitor's hand the king
Has left his mortal halls
His people mourn in shadows
Behind these haunted walls
You sometimes hear a whisper
And then the silence falls
Vengeful souls are resting
Until their master calls

I saw the glint of metal from
The corner of my eye
Sharp pain and flash of lightening
Then darkness numbed my mind
My wraith of thousand shadows
Has roamed for thousand days
Watching them in silence
Veiled in crimson haze

Chorus...

Another sleepless night
I know they wonder why
It will pass - they say - and yes
The know that it's a lie
There's beauty in their anguish
The blade will bide it's time
King's death is lived forever
Vengeance will be mineAblaze are the spirits among which I rest
In the heart of this darkgreen realm of giant oaks
My long forgotten forest, precious kingdom of timeless grace and secrets

Heart of the woods, a sacred wisdom
Shall dwell eternally in our pagan blood
Come forth Lord of the trees, and possess our souls
We will serve ye forever oh graceful God

Rising through the night, engraved in stones
The sacred wood, these collonades of an ancient pride

Eternal Gods, supreme fathers of a glorious past
I praise their divine crown(Instrumental)Born to rot
\Misery their lot
Lips sewn shut
Their minds...
Trained to question not
Our sacred lies
The owl cries
As swarms of headless mice
Are fooled to rise
We made them pay the price
To save our paradise
For we are the chosen
The lords of this land;
The future lies broken,
Buried in the sand
And we'll rig the game
And we'll dodge the blame
And we'll vanish out of sight
Leaving no tracks through the mud
Of human ashes & bloodLooking deep down in living mirror
 Don't you know the ancient was here
 Something's really wrong over here
 Where all of lost soul have to stay
 Waiting for a day

 Flying headlong swallows are maidens
 Navyi cries for beauty and madness
 Evermist and never tomorrow
 All you've lost just sorrow

 Looking deep down in living mirror
 Don't you know the ancient was here
 Something's really wrong over here
 All you've lost not here

 Deep Down!..
 Living mirror
 Let you out of your greasy fears
 Your life is just one more
 Awakening of your inner power
 You know... You know... You know...

 Living mirror's trap for the righteous
 Strange reflections
 Ice-cold and lightless
 Guess you've got that
 I was a liar
 Now you're getting up higher
 You know... You know... You know...(Instrumental)Darkness falls, lightning strikes 
Pulsating sounds in the air 
Quaking earth, smell of death 
Screams and cries of despair 
Chaos reigns as blood runs red 
Result of mankind's errors 
Ravaging them all.  A force of evil 
Apocalyptic thrashing terror 

EVIL 
rise upon the way 
DESTRUCTION 
no time to pray 
Bodies fall 
Death to those who fight 
NEMESIS 
prepare for the final strike 

Global meltdown, genocide 
Screaming, tortured souls 
Ripped battered and broken 
Plunging into the depths of the unknown 
Non stop violence 
Ultimate bringer of death 
No choice left 
But to face the Nemesis 

EVIL 
rise upon the way 
DESTRUCTION 
no time to pray 
Bodies fall 
Death to those who fight 
NEMESIS 
prepare for the final strike(Instrumental)(lyrics: Ion)

I Pray to Satan,
Pray to the Lord of Light
Asking for wisdom,
Power and delight.

I ask you for wisdom...
Oh, Lord, regain my sight!
I want to be omniscient,
To perceive the Light!

I Pray to Satan,
Pray to the Lord of Night
Asking for power,
wisdom and delight

I ask you for power...
To rule sway the destinies!
Let the destiny die
Come true for all my enemies!

Let the slaves be sinful!
No single sin in my spirit...
Let the humans be blind!
No humanity in my being...

I Hail You, my Lord!
I Praise Your sacred Name!
Bless my Mind and bless my Sword!
Let my eyes blaze with your flame!

Let me rise over this cruel world.
Let me be alone.
Let me find the part of mine.
Oh Let me know, give me the Sign!

I Pray to Satan,
Pray to the Lord of Life
Asking for power,
wisdom and delight

I ask you for delight...
Eternal pleasure for my slaves.
They want be carnally satisfied.
They will be bondslaves 'till their death.

(lyrics by Ion)All the hatred
All disgust
All the things that envokes my darkest side
I don't need no one to see what I feel
(cause the gods are always by my side)
There are no more limits
People are only outside, never inside

What can they achieve if dead are already their thoughts
Gods will punish the weaklings and bury their
Rotten flesh in the deepest pits
Out where no glimpse of light nor hope never reaches

(Honor the gods, love your woman
and fight for your fatherland!)The men holding the cross are coming ...
The charm and harmony that exists here will end
Sad days and nights will come
With the pain I feel in my heart

We should not fear ...
We must not surrender ...
We are children of nature
And with it will die

These men want the end of our story
But they will not ...
Can destroy our bodies
But they can not destroy our roots

A new chapter in our history begins today
With a lot of blood, pain and sorrow
I say goodbye to my family and siblings
No fear the end with sadness in my heart

I get the blow ...
I see my life vanishing
I see everything I ever loved
Being destroyed in the name of a dirty belief 

The earth absorbs our blood
The same land where ever we live
Niled crosses on our soil
Mark the invasion of a new territory

The wind dried my tears
The screams, no longer hear them more ...
I feel I am leaving for the unknown
To join the old ...

Nature, our mother
Relieve our pain
Embrace us with your warmth
In this moments of terror

Lyrics by IpseLife is persecuted
 Infinited insanity
 Pass through the tortures
 Feel sweet neverending pain
 
 Abstract existence
 Press of the fear
 Morbid soul is disconnected
 Two-faced idols
 Ambiguous words
 Guinea-pig in experiment
 
 Compromise - transaction  with a conscience
 Total profanation is prevailing
 Heterodox
 
 Struggle with dissent
 Conduct is under control
 Truth is just the only one
 Falsity dictates proviso
 
 Brutal reprisal
 Assault is the best defence
 Reality gives birth to pest
 One against all
 In exposed lies
 Stand to gain or will be deadThree years of winter

After Baldr's death
As payment for treachery and insidiousness,
Giants from Jotunheim sent terrible frosts
With furious winds and blizzards
To the earth

People turned away from light of the true gods,
Having preferred them sickly by god's son from the South
The moral chaos and blindness,
Fornication and bloody conflicts absorbed them

Patrimonial norms were broken,
The brother raised a hand against the brother,
And the son against the father
Such is there was a price of acceptance of new belief

Guards of the sacred woods, deep lakes and prompt rivers
Rose from the barrows covered with autumn yellow leaves
Froze the water by breath, blew by awful frosty winds and
ghastly blizzards
And in its howls was audible the devil laughter of the Wild
hunting riding the sky

And Fernir will devour Sun and put world into the darkness
Amd Jormugand will rise from the deep and sea will come out of
shores
And fiery giant Surtr will burn out the earth by his flaming
sword
And ship of the dead, Naglfar will sail from Helheim
And sons of Muspellheim will crush the Bifrost

But the body of the crucified whore too won't escape
Hugin and Munin will peck out to this nit of an eye
Pigs will pick and will devour it's entrails
And it's rotten soul will fall in a serpent hall and will suffer
there until the end of times

The three-year winter will terminate
In atonement of treachery and death of the old world
Shadows of old gods will rest in peace
And justice will be restored together with renewal of all realEndless nights, eternal darkness,
and a breath of neverending wind enclosed me.
Surrounded from an endless forest,
whose silence and loneliness seemed to reach to the stars.

A place where time catched up with me.
The last daylight seemed to lie back so long ago.

The wind pulled me into his realm, surrounded full of sorrow.

My eyes, they were so cold, dense fog enclosed me,
and the night seemed to become always longer.

No hopes, no will, nothing was left in me.
Waiting for a breath of silence, to take me home,
into the realm of mountains.He is ancient, than the earth and sun
Feel the power of the unholy ones
In the deppest shadows of my soul
He is waiting for the final war

Raise his name, bless the blakest king
Sacrifice!, blood upon the steel
Destroy the weakness, let de vengance be
A new order, a thousand warriors will

My body is burning, my blood turns black
As the night wins the battle against the light

Jaws of nausea bites my brain
As the smell of humanity hurts me
My mind is blinded by eternal hate

I`m a warrior, and i will never die
Because i`m possessed by the unholy light
No hope for the weak!

I evoke you as i see
Shadows runing along the path of immortality
This pain is feeding my misanthrophy
Immortal spirit of darkness!Where our world is - the land of full moon?
 Will that once had been ever come back?
 Where's your pride, White Man?
 Has the cross veiled your eyes?
 
For thousand years strangers kept this land to dishonour
 To the people of strange blood you've sold your honour
 Your forefathers call you to avenge their blood
 The heritage of ancestors which you have to fulfil
 
But now the time has come!
 You must wake and call the oath
 Millenium of disgrace you'll erase
 Because your blood ordains you this!
 
There are legions of those like you left
 Go that we can take revenge for forefather's tears
 Golden cross symbol of Europe's extinction
 We stand by your side, warrior pride is what leads us!
 
Loyalty is our honour - loyalty to our blood
 Go awake - Aryan and handle the sword
 Time has come now
 Thousand years of disgrace to erase!Deadliest dread and woe
Hatred and despair
Owl, raven and crow
Blood is everywhere

Druid Isle aflame
Gods carved in oak
Holy men are slain
iron, blood and smoke

Sky Gods weaving sorrow
In a Celtic hinterland 

Sacred is the moon
Clothed in deadly red
The forest is our tomb
White wizards dead 

Sky Gods weaving sorrow
In a Celtic hinterland 

The dreadful thirst of death
Parched we fall
The dreadful thirst of death
Parched we fall

Lost ancient ones
Under leaf, log and stone
Magic cosmic dance
Never more to roam

The dreadful thirst of death
Parched we fall
The dreadful thirst of death
Parched we fall

Sky Gods weaving sorrow
In a Celtic hinterland(Instrumental)Pure rotten noise falls from your tongue
Spew out your wickedness this battle can't be won
Alright, we are close to hell, give me more of hell
We have been through hell
Aaarrrrgggghhh degradation
Sworn to the oath of endless abuse
Sliced up nothing remains your evil has let loose
Locked up in lust chained down in dirt
Nothing left to destroy my soul has been cursedOh, what a sudden miraculous escape
Right from Mouth of Madness
Directly from the brink
We are saved

You have to cast away 
Your personality
Which enslaves
And you will be saved

No more fear, and no more liability
The Hive knows everything
The Hive will never die
Unlike you

But the Hive can share
The immortality
With a few
(Maybe you?)

Just work with precision
Don't make your own decisions
And you will be free, 
Ah, how comfortable, isn't it?

Here comes the new reality
The triumph of hive mind
Escape from the individuality
New possession of mankind

There is no longer the strong and the weak
Just society 
That lives in harmony
With itself

The drones and the queen bee.
Crown the hierarchy
Hoarding wealth

And you just do your bit
Be in line with your breed
You will get what you need
And don't get it into your head

Here comes the new reality
The triumph of hive mind
Escape from the individuality
New possession of mankind

You're no longer a single worm
All together we're the swarm

Don't rebel now, just accept
The ancient wisdom of insects.

Here comes the new reality
The triumph of hive mind
Escape from the individuality
New possession of mankind

Witness of the new reality
Exile in this throng
It's so rotten, so pathetic to
Live in hope that I am wrongWho wrote the Hobbit, Two Towers and Return of the King?
J.R.R. Tolkein!
Who wants Rankin/Bass's ass in a sling?
J.R.R. Tolkein!
The only fantasy I'd ever read to my children
But not The Simarillion!
Who wants to kill Ralph Bakshi for the Lord of the Rings?
J.R.R. Tolkein!(Instrumental)The God's Blow

It Is Our Call For The VictoryAve!!!

For thy eternal flame render erudition,

Hail, Lucifer!!!
Inheritor of the immortal legacy, the truth lies in your words.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Am I awake, or am I asleep? Am I... imagining...

Is it a dream, the visions I see? Is it... reality...

Where dreams go to die 
Where dreams go to die
Where dreams go to die
The nightmare is alive
Where dreams go to die - Fears grow wings and fly

A bestial murder
A terrible ghost
Demonic... possession

Inhumane torture
Excruciating pain
I have... been slain

Is it a dream,  the visions I see? Is it... reality...

Cold hands strangling me - Anxiety is choking me
I can't seem to wake - Trapped in the maze

Bony fingers hold me down
Violent force, putrid breath
Stench of death fills the room
A feeling of impending doom

Spur of the moment
Vindictiveness
No impact analysis

No sense of consequences
Rupturing the skin
Grinding the flesh...
vindictiveness

They are for real
the visions I see
It's my...
reality

Where dreams go to die 
Where dreams go to die
Where dreams go to die
The nightmare is alive
Where dreams go to die
Fears grow wings and flyThe night arrives
And with her dark veil
Under her semblent
Our stately land

The land of fog
From exuberant forest
Of powerful mountains
And crystal lakes

I am the horizon where clouds
Bring winds of truth
Mountains wolves howling
Announcing the winter

The moon call the wolves
Reigning the dark night that
Reflects the lost souls
In the lakes southern mother

Our dear and beloved land
Mother of the south
And people pride
Brave valiant and honorable
How beautiful is our mother land(Instrumental)It has been so long, waiting for IT to come
A thousand times I have snarled your prayers.
To the very end, of a mind so bend
I've spent the years counting the days.
Now at last you came, to impure my veins
I greet you welcome to the feast.
The oath is clear, sworn in godly spheres
My name written out in blood.

Ohh! Bastard beast,
Spawned in rebel fields.
Revenge is my sight, racing through the night,
Do you feel me coming?
Bastard beast
...

I wish to dwell, on a thousand dead
Laying slaughtered in my path.
I can not stop this magic thought
A possession of raging hate.
All I can feel is the vast appeal
The dead root of a human soul.
Possession strikes, with glorious might
It's a blizring sight.

Ohh! Bastard beast,
Spawned in rebel fields.
Straight out'a hell, hear me scream and yell,
Now it's time to burn!
Bastard beast
...

I ride, upon the wings of hell
Infectious thoughts burning my brain.
The bastard beast erects
To bend the hook aimed for your flesh.
The time has come no place to hide
Ancient wrath unleashed in splendour
You beg and plead, you want to heed
But this time it's all for heal

Ohh! Bastard beast,
Spawned in rebel fields.
I'm son of a bitch, baptised in devil spit,
Now it's time to pay.
Bastard beastThere was a darkness over the valleys of death
An raven high and far off above the mountains
The winged messenger watched the glory of the battles
The battles of Utgard

From northern Highlands we came to a battle we ride
Hold high our right hand - tentousand side by side
With shields of steel - bloodred swords and axes
Killing the enemies  by the name of the gods

The skyline in flames by the power of Thor
The hammer crushes down our victory is near
With power and might warriors of steel
Hallowed be battles and fight - Valhalla is here

The way where we come is the way where we will go
Together we fight the enemies land
The way to Valhall is the way to die by the sword
Together we fight together we kill

Fighting the whole world - enslave all man
Rape all the wives - there is no fear
Immerse the enemies - spitting on religion
Burning down the villages - this means war

Riding the northwind - proud as a king
Free like the raven stand up and fight
Here my command and rise our flag
Ready for boarding - Kill Fuck and Die

There was a darkness over the valleys of death

The springing the dying, the song and the weeping
And the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone
Two ravens the lords of the wind guides us to battle again
Stormwind, thunder and lightning, the Force of our godsSnow-white wolf born passion
Your proud running like
Wild gallop Alpha-heart beating
Would fly with stars blue tundra icicle
Show Him, yarn

In steep glowing ebony eyes
His only blessed-winged counterpart
Black furry bitch: embodied desire
Blue tundra icicle, yarn Him, yarn!

Thunder does not scare
Bleeding from a thousand wounds
On bloody stream surface
Ancient moonlight looms

In your pack order reigns
under your loyal lead
On thickets of mountains
where ink-sky freezes

Blue tundra icicle, yarn more, sing!

Moon-faced nights
Your blood always runs
Your shining, dazzling
Brazen slurry trace

Blue tundra icicle, only the spirit sings...

[Note: The last two verses are printed in the booklet as part of the lyrics, but are not sung.](Instrumental)(Instrumental)As The Murder Flies

Enslaved in strongholds, lightless
Broods a wraith not dear nor live
A restless spirit born of scorn
For which no salvation lies

(curse 1)
Of molten anger lying still
Of burning bark to spite
Reclaim our stolen kingdom
Bring death to reclaim life

(curse 2)
This human plague hath ridden
The wood of soul and light
A burden forgiven
A sea of endless blight

Long ago a tyrant sieged the forest
Tearing holes both far n wide
Into this sylvan world of magick
Forever scarring land and sky

(curse 3)
Once taken thou shalt wither
Once touched by mother night
Existence will escape you all
As the murder flies

The tyrants army fell beneath black feathered rites
Unleashed by the towering majesty (misanthropic)
From mountains their numbers stole the light

The few protesting the tyrants vision left thru this perilous night
Drawn to the fire in the mountain (misanthropic)
To join with the earth, to give their lives

A sudden silense as the swarm returned to a shrine
Deep in  the heart of the forest (bessed in darkness)
The land now cleansed, as the murder flies

No sound came from the village
No torchlight lit the night
A peaceful silence blessed the land
Without a human soul in sight

The wind sang for the mountain
Crows wings caressed the trees
The soil inhaled once again
The wood exhaled a chilling breezeEmbraced by darkness
I hear creatures so lifeless
Laugh at me 
I feel the wings of death
Reach out for me 
I smell its breath a smell of evil
Cold air twist my skin
The pulse of infinity chokes me 

Bless thee for granting me pain
For blinding my eyes 
And cleansing my mind 
...immortalize my soul

Mirror so divine 
Show me my dreams 
Drams of hate 
Where the blood 
Of my enemies is spilled 
...make them real

As I scream in pain
My final scream
My being dissolves
And fills the emptiness 
Now I am all
I am the hate in man
Blood spilled in my name 
...in sacrifice
Feeds my hordes 
To carry out my dreams.Blessed by the gods, the spirit of war dominate us.
Swords bound to shed the blood of the enemy. Filled with hatred, our swords are ready for the battle.
The earth shakes in the distance drums announce the pagan war.

I Raise my sword to the sky and ask the gods to protect me in this battle of life and death.
Where the brave may live forever.
The time to fight is coming 
no mercy, no mercy.(Instrumental)Rise! The rage of our ancient pride 
Raise! The flag of blood and holy light 
Hate's the power we've been saving up 
So let's fight them under red stripe on the 
White flag fluttering so proud and free 
We shall get our sincere liberty 
Dreams of freedom are to get so real 
There's no one who dares to stop us on this 
Way of long-awaited sacrifice 
Fire of justice burning in our eyes 
We're the nation who can shake the skies 
There's no one who dares to stop us on this 
Way we march together in all arms 
Now's the time for us to put out stars 
We don't like and to light new ones up 
So let's march on under red stripe on the white 

Bells are calling us to gather up 
Hail to true and ancient our Gods 
Hail to all the people who act free 
What will be will be but we shall raise the 
Flag of true and real liberty 
Raise! The flag of our History 
There's no way to suffer lies around 
That's no more we're going out of underground 

Abandon all hope! 
Abandon all hope! 
Abandon all hope! 
Abandon all hope! 

Light of darkness we don't ever mind 
All we see the years of lies behind 
Now we are to break it finally 
What will be will be but we shall rise to 
Live forever mighty, proud and free 
It's the only way for us to be 
You can run but you can't ever hide 
We shall kill you if you're our enemy 

Abandon all hope! 
Abandon all hope! 
Abandon all hope! 
Abandon all hope!3. Prophecy
(music and lyrics by Vidar)

Once the sleeping powers will awake,
From the darkest depths they'll arise,
Spreading across the seas of the holy land,
Like a plague they'll infect the world.

...and then the evil shall be born,
sacrificing other's scorn,
will quietly sit on its throne,
empire of underground
will bury what wasn't found,
will we be ready to rebound?

Prophecy

"And after last strike of darkness,
the heavens were torn in two,
and the blood of Seraphims fell upon the earth,
the bounds of the netherworld were broken
as the Satan's legions attacked
from the underworld a throne rose on the ground.
Upon that throne, Lord of Darkness sat,
surrounded by pagan Gods,
and the temples of God all burned to ashes,
After two thousand years,
filled with the supremacy of filth,
The king of eternal empire was enthroned... again"

The seed of Christ will be impaled,
Crucified on the mountain of the dead,
Ancient divinity shall unite that day
with the Four Horsemen they'll rideA strange desire burns
Deep within our hearts;
To rid this world of the weak
To eternally silence the frail

The end of false mercy
Compassion is wiped away
Down with the empire of the meek!

Wuotan! Cast your spear!
Over the Vanir host
Wuotan! Cast your spear!
And bring war into the world!

Our soul now awakens
From a deep lethargic sleep
By the light of a new age
This dawn is a call to war!

Their lies are rejected
Nothing can hold us down
We now claim what is ours!

A return to savagery
No longer are we numbed
Broken are the chains
Forged by the chosen few

Our dishonour of the past
Washed away by blood
Gushing from their veins!

Wuotan! Cast your spear!
Over the Vanir host
Wuotan! Cast your spear!
And bring war into the world!(Instrumental)When images are fading
And sounds are muting away
Where ration has no place
Only my mind to lift me up

My appearance is not defined
Uncontrolled emotions are stunning my mind
As the stars vanish im my eyes
A blurred picture out of nothing appears

Who will lead me the way
As I walk in silence
So hart to achieve the glory
So easy to fall back in decay

Hidden behind a veil of memories
Wrapped in the beauty in mystery inside
As if night and day were one
And echoes of thoughts roam through my heart

Sp now I remember, the moments of silence
These moments in which I comfort
Wild imaginings flash before my eyes
Isolated from the other side

As I cherish my fragile illusion
I'm reaching the greatest intensity
But slowly I loose my grip
And reality takes me back

Out in the silence, I cope with my feelings
Leaving behind all the thoughts
That reap my mind
I close my eyes for the feelings inside me
Hoping to defeat my deepest fear insideHe is not someone common and,
Skin isn't red as in your dreams
He wants you to convey his greed
Exchange for your soul

He doesn't care about your destiny
Don't try to fool him, it's in vain

He needed to know, what happened to him
He felt strange, but now he returned
He was longing to be someone
But now he came back and you'll testify

[Chorus 1]
He will turn into a friend
Thirsty for revenge
And grant you eternal life
To destroy you from inside

[Chorus 2]
He's the god from the seas
Since was killed by Gofannon
Seas are calling through the waves
For the Dylan's lost Soul.

[Solo]

[Speak]

He was Dylan, a lucky man
And he thought he would live forever
He was wrong, he was searching for the eternal happiness
But not anymore...
Now, he wanders every night, every time
Searching the only to blame for this
And to stop being Dylan, the lost soul.

[Chorus 1]

[Final Chorus]
On winter, he will be
Your shelter, your home
Then in him you will trust
And your wit will betray&#1054;&#1090;&#1095;&#1077;&#1075;&#1086; &#1085;&#1077; &#1093;&#1086;&#1076;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; &#1074; &#1087;&#1086;&#1093;&#1086;&#1076;&#1099;

lost.
Men with crosses and a fictious God, oh why did
you let them deceive you!
They extinguished your flames of passion and pride
and taught you their laws of weakness and sin,
shame of your body, your nature and Gods.
Cast into their darkness of emptiness and fear we 
still are.

At night I hear the cries of those screaming out in
anguish.
Pityfull souls awaiting salvation, dreaming of
those golden gates.
At night I hear their prayers, prayers to a God who never came.

Sin, good and evil were introduced.
Obey our God or suffer in hell!
Your Gods are demons, evil and foul,
by honouring them you condemn your soul.
Pride is vanity, humbleness is praised.
The weak and the sick are glory to His name.

Ages have past since those cursed days.
Our Gods forgotten, buried and dead.
Faded to dust without leaving a trace, so far from
the truth this is.
Our faith may have withered but perished has it
not, neither have our Gods they still look down
upon us. Sad they are from all that has passed but
all is not lost so raise yourself up and be strong.Part of a cosmos, one with the universe,
different dimensions, worlds to be discovered
A new beginning, life itself gained essence
of a higher being, greater purpose for another journey
(Part of a cosmos, one with the universe)A gibbous moon hungs in a cloudless night sky

of dark mountains where ceremonies are celebrating

Warrtor's rage pagan war commence, for get the time of pace and life
total deaath and war reigns everywhere
Pagan force barbaric fury, carve in stone thy legend of blood
descend from the mountains as an Hirpus son and kill

After the foray the carnage ends
wine and beer will be good with firls
the only law here is that the strongest wins
but the battles never ends
mead is served girls are fucked and my mind now thinks 
it's time to kill again and again
take ensorcelled steel blessed by pagan rites
the christians have to be destroyed
rivers of blood seas of bloods total war
here it comes the armageddon
my sword will prevail.

Lyrics: P. Dedes 

Across the cold lake 
There is a haunted place 
Where crawling like a snake 
You'll see the fear in my face 

A thousand years so far 
He lives in the house of pain 
He is condemned for ever 
To hear the drops of rain 

You are a freak of nature 
The cursed words were so close 
The only thing you have to do 
Is just sow fear 

In the night, start to fight 
Nobody knows how you're feeling 
In night you'll be all right 
Your bloody fingers are killing 

He is screaming full of despair 
Through the night 
How long will he pay for this? 
As long as he is trying to escape 
He'll never reach releaseWild galloping horses,
on green
vast sunny meadows.
Lakes in harmony
with the skies: pale blue

Forest, peaceful and proud
Trees, ancient
and hundred metres tall

Wild galloping horses,
on green
vast sunny meadows.
Lakes in harmony
with the skies: pale blue

Forest, peaceful and proud
Trees, ancient
and thousand years oldMother earth is crying again, she cannot carry on
She's abused everytime, what are you waiting for?
The oceans are about to die, mountains and forests too
If we join our forces now, perhaps we could be part of the new world

The sky spits venomous clouds, And this is just the beginning

You are full of waste and also full of pain
The Human cannot see that, the Human doesn't care
When you cut down a tree, you're cutting down your legs
It would be better if we realize what matters and what does not.



You are full of waste and also full of pain
The Human cannot see that, the Human doesn't care
When she was young, she was beautiful, rich... Even now.
The difference is that their children are slowly consuming its purity

The Horned God will spread his wrath, he'll come to take revenge
He'll take advantage of our need and also our dreams
Since the human has possesed all the natural wealth
This has became a complete fool, he doesn't know how much needs her to live

The sea is hiding from us, please don't suffer anymore

You are full of waste and also full of pain
The Human cannot see that, the Human doesn't care 
When you look around, you find destruction
When you look at the mirror, you find the guilty

Death, chaos, corruption and injustice
All united in one thing... The man.

When we look around, we try to realize
This cannot be real... When will the slaughter end?
Destiny is in our hands 
We have to take care from the arms of deathAlbatroz is back 
riding on the wind
Flying out of hell 
Chaos and pain beginI wait on the borders of the dream
The dark ait tastes like the night
Under the moonlight we walk together
Lusted for darkness, the smell of blood

It's a loneley game, the longing for blood
The moonlight chases the night away
As I stand here in the shadow of her stone
Undead my dearest, o undead my love

In my dreams you came to me
And your love was more precious than live
The sunlight sought for me deep under my stone
Until I woke like a fog in the night

For many centuries I've stalked the earth
Driven by the hunger, the taste for blood
By morning I wasn't more than a dream
A cold body beneath a heavy stone

I offered a truth more beautiful than a dream
For that I only wanted your love
I tried to comfort your restless spirit
Blood tastes much sweeter later in the night

Sometimes my dearest stalk the night
Sometimes the lie cold in graves
No more than food for the maggots
In my dreams you rose from the earth

Rise.......

I waited at your stone half the night
But you refused to wake from your dream
Sleep tight my dearest
I offered you the world(Instrumental)I don't know the reason why the sky is blue
I don't know the reason why clouds are white
I don't know the reason why the fire burns
I don't know the reason why wars break out in this world
I don't know why a great number of innocent people should die

Time goes by
But I can't find it

If we could become clever, if we could become wise
Was everything going good?
Please tell me the reason why we are here
Somehow we have something to carry out
Somehow we can have a hope
Somehow we can believe everyone is worth living

I don't know why we can't keep peace
I don't know why many children starve to death
I don't know why we can't keep peace
I don't know why many children starve to death

If we could become clever, if we could become wise
Was everything going good?
Please tell me the reason why we are here
Somehow we have something to carry out
Somehow we can have a hope
Somehow we can believe everyone is worth livingTransilvanian Hunger...cold..soul
 Your hands are cruel...to haunt..to haunt

 the mountains are cold...soul...soul...
 careful..pale...forever at Night

 Take me...can't you feel the Call
 Embrace Me Eternally in your daylight slumber

 To be Draped by the Shadow of your Morbid Palace
 oh, Hate Living...The only heat is warm blood

 So Pure... So Cold
 Transilvanian Hunger

 Hail to the True, intense vampires
 A story made for Divine fulfillment

 To be the ones breathing a Wind of Sorrow
 Sorrow and fright the dearest catharsis

 Beautiful Evil Self to be the Morbid Count
 A part of a Pact that is delightfully immortal

[scream]

 Feel the call freeze you with the uppermost desire
 Transilvanian Hunger...my mountain is cold

[scream]

 So Pure... Evil, Cold
 Transilvanian HungerA KINGDOM OF DEATH BEGINS FROM NOW ON 
THE ENDLESS BATTLE IS ABOUT TO GET CLOSE

THE VICTORIOUS HYMN IS ABOUT TO BE SUNG 
WITH XUE AT AN OUR HEAD

OUR THRONE WILL NEVER FALL

RAISE YOUR SHIELDS 
MAKE FEEL THE FEAR TO YOUR ENEMIES

THEY WILL DIE

A KINGDOM OF DEATH BEGINS FROM NOW ON 
THE ENDLESS BATTLE IS ABOUT TO GET CLOSE

THE BATTLE IS ON

GLORY IS WAITING FOR USCreation of light
Choked by a pole in the ground
Captures of light
Become inerted

In the lowest darkest pit
I feel them crawl
Through my darkest hate and spit
I see them fall

Nightmoon on the hunt to dominate
Shades moving faster than fire
Since the dawn of shadow men
Faster than fire
Faster than light
An outcast obsessed by shadows
Crippled, weeping, gnashing of teeth

Night terror
The sun has been blocked
Crippled by darkness
Burning despair
From the shadow keeper

Night terrorAs I wander through this Hell
All is dead that I can tell
Long live death
When I fall out from my crypt
Your last drop of blood I have sipped
Your flesh is mine I need it one more time
Moon is full the sky is darkened
Death is here til the end
Long live deathYears of prophecy
Dreams or trueful stories.
Might of ancestry behind
Is it fabulous tale, or maybe just myth

What we must sing
About concern, about joy?
What we must praise in our hymns
Warriors' courage and valour, or firmness?

Field is wide, we can't see edge
The way is long, can't see it's end
We can't find nightsky down, can't touch the stars.

Gorgeous sunshine didn't prompt
Bright crescent didn't advise
And soothsayers were laid down
Our memory turned, now it's all false

Where are you gone, magicians
Who instructed us of living
Who can give us real knowledge
What is worth to hymning..

Field is wide, we can't see edge
The way is long, can't see it's end
We can't find nightsky down, can't touch the stars.

Memory of a nation.
There are the songs of what we don't know
There were the days of the great glory
And were the days of the defeats

Heroes and mongrels.
There are the songs of what we don't know
There were the days of the great glory
And were the days of defeats

Where are you gone, magicians.
Where are you gone?Vaarwel ons mooi vlaander land.

Vaarwel onze gedachten van het mooie land.

Vaarwel onze mooie groene bossen.


 

We gaan de dood gemoed.

De grond kleurt rood van ons heidens bloed.

Onze families zullen we missen.


 

We horen gegil rondom ons.

Zij zijn misschien met meer als ons.

We hebben deze strijd al lang verloren.



Met bescherming van de zomerzon.

Kregen we een kracht dat de dood overwon.

Het Vlaamse volk krijg je niet verpletterd.


 

Deze strijd is zwaar en lang.

Maar het Vlaamse leger is niet meer bang.

De Vlaamse leeuw schittert op het slagveld.


 

Met bescherming van de zomerzon.

Kregen we een kracht dat de dood overwon.

Het Vlaamse volk krijg je niet verpletterd.


 

Herdenk degenen die hebben gefaald.

We zetten ze het allemaal betaald.

Onze winst is niet te stoppen.


 

De hoorns klinken in de wind.

Aan de mond staat gauw een pint.

Om de overwinning te vieren!


 

Zij waren met The resurrected one:
Believe in the strength you have
And you're rid of this burden!

The fallen one:
I am the sovereign of the legions
I will make you crawl!
I was born with intent to destroy and none will come through

The resurrected one:
Get free of this wrecking force!
The path of love will lead you

The fallen one:
I laugh myself to death
God is so weak and powerless!
Where is he now? I spit on the grave of his son!

----

Trapped in a downward spiral
Birth, death and decay

My core seems to break
I'm far from hope

I have reached the point of no return
My head seems to explode

These voices shall become silent...
I can't endure this anymoreThe empire of rats, we're leeching for free 
In your fucking world 
We're gonna take it back 
We're gonna make you pay in blood 

We're gonna take it back 
We're gonna make you pay for what you shed 
We're gonna make you pay in bloodBorn in flames of battles and fights,
We are the youth, which is firm and strong.
And, bravely marching on, we know that
Tomorrow belongs to us.

Lines of warriors, young and brave,
Stand line to line like a steel wall.
Ready to fight for the right cause.
Tomorrow belongs to us.

We honour the sacred memory of fallen heroes,
Of those, who gave their lives in the fight for truth,
Won't ever forgive their spilled blood,
Tomorrow belongs to us.

Rest in peace, fallen comrades,
We'll revenge to enemies for you.
The victory comes, your death wasn't vain,
Tomorrow belongs to us.

Look, how the youth rises for battle,
We follow the steps of heroic ancestors.
We know the meanness and cowardice.
Tomorrow belongs to us.

Confidently we look into the future,
And we'll do what was prescribed us.
Spirit of young warriors tempered stronger than steel.
Tomorrow belongs to us.

We give the oath on the sacred banner:
"To give life for nation, faith, land!"
And thousands of lips repeat this oath,
Because tomorrow belongs to us.

There's a proud song of our blood in our hearts,
And the call flies through our lines:
"We're here, we're ready to do a new feat,
Tomorrow belongs to us!"(Instrumental)In memory to those who have fought,
those who have awaited and who have longed.
The ones who have gone prior to their time.
The Ancient One has arrived... In memory.Srdcom jedinym, uslachtilym

Oh how I wish that I could die
This agony that I have suffered
Deep enough to make even gods cry

Sons of a mother doomed
What gain is life to me
Oh to die and win release
Quitting this loathed existence

I did bind that accursed one
By these strong oaths to me
Oh to see him and his bride
Brought of utter destruction

The fierce black fury of my wrath
A bitter cry of mortal lamentation
I call on to the cursed traitor
You'll pay for this humiliation

A coward at the sight of steel
With deadlier thoughts than mine
No heart is filled
No deadlier thoughts than mine

Poor children your blood is mine
Poor children your mortal blood is minea mighty and giant titan
can't accept his position
as a minion he won't stay
he will rise to be the king

son of sky and earth
so he was called
his father the ruler
Kronos, murderer, tyrannus

one day sky turned red
coloured by godly blood
rain of flesh fell into the ocean
god deposed by his son

he just wants to rule
he just longs for might
to get to the top
Kronos will kill

he wants to see blood
he wants you to kneel
you shall pray to him
him as your god

now is his moment
now he will rise up
watch out, Uranus,
here comes the king

bloodred drops fell of it
cut through Uranus' flesh and bones
brought his carrier endless mightSiohhi I

SiohhiI feel the cold of death
My nightmares now is true
My ground is destroyed
Together my dreams and poems

My ground is cursed by the cross
Death, pain and sorrow
In this place that was just purity

I'm going on a journey of no return
To go away from here...
To go to the infinite...
To go to the unknown...
To go to the unknown...
My ground is cursed by the cross
Death, pain and sorrow
In this place that was just purity

To the unknown...

Lyrics by Ipse(Instrumental)The dim woods, the snowy fields,
The deep lakes - it's my land!
The great warriors, the pagan rituals,
The ancient gods - ifs my land!
On my land I stand
And admire It's beauty
It's dim forests and It has dark
oakgroves
It has endless fields and It has snowy
hills
It has transparent lakes and It has
deeply rives
It's a country of my ancestors'
It's my ancestors land!
Many years ago on that ancient land
Lived, fought and died great warriors
Clanged steel of swords and flew
blood of enemies
Many great battles took place in that
country
But my ancestors have never kneeled
And they always defeated their
adversaries.
Once upon a time there worshiped
great gods
For true ancient pagan deities
them
Altars again are standing in the
forests
Now we again come unit with nature.
We again hear call of forests
Blood of ancestors is flowing in our
veins
Their voices sounding in our brains
And we sharpen our swords
Great war has just began
We'll protect our ancient land!(Instrumental)Swirling dust before the windows
There is no light in me
I killed all its gleam
A feeling rising and just growing

The law writing
Death-bringing black clouds
Wreathing above the mountains
Hurricane of stone crusher
Dust breaker feelings
Rampant wedding
Dance of beasts unleashed
In the pervading moon garden
Painted with blood
Just screams can be heard from them
Whose gods message no more
Whirling dust before my window

There is no light in me
No more light
My soul is whirling
My body is streaming

In the hurricane of devastation
I disappear in the wind
And become one with
EternityShadows... of a universe... of a cosmic world
Immaculate by the ashes, purificate by stars

Searching... paradise, a virgin world
Where feelings are death
Infernal paradise

You'll seek
To find the place
Where the four winds
Blow in the same way

Open the gate in front of you
Where thinhgs never change
And you see the shadows birth

Your soul iced
Underground
With blank eyes

No prayer
No crucify
Will be your saviour

Take the right why throuth east wind
Deamons are waiting for you
Your destiny is written

Walking towards the west wind
Hoping to find the exit...
But the exit isn't there(Instrumental)Directing by Destiny
Tormenting by Life
Am I Human or Creature?
Mountain or the Deepest Ocean?

In the shadow of Darkness
Rising the Insanity
I can see the Light again
Over the Endless

Thirsty by Endless
And sound of Twilight
Am I Light or Shadow?
Shining shadow of light...

Like a Candle's screaming Flame
Blaze up the eternal Light:
The Stars are Burning
Slowly in Hate...We shall go across the snowbound field
We shall go above the field of death
We shall search for the valiant warriors there
Those who died for you, those who died for us

One lies lifeless, where sabres mangled him
Here lies one impaled with an arrow shaft
From their wounds hot red blood like the rain was shed
On our native soil, on the ancient fields

He who fell for homeland in noble death
Shall be blest by friends stood still side by side
And to him, brave man, who remained alive
We shall be the faithful friends, brothers in arms

We shall not assess the rich armor
Golden charm in battle does not mean anything
We shall eulogize the valiant men
Hark, ye warriors brave, lionhearted men(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Return to the primate era
After all this progress
The cavern's technology
Comes to an x birth
Tribal behaviors
In the astral plan
The human mingles
To his creators
The time's gene
Has been teleported
To a far age
Of his temporal earth.
The effects are in sight;
Colors disapear in the sky
Tropic is returning somewhere
To let the place to the ice.
The past will be
The future game
The present time,
An alteration line
Life kills the human being
She ejects imperfect pieces
The natural selection
Works for and ideal humanization
The cyclone
Arises in the time
Resurrection of this cycle
And they forgot the meaning
Of the intelligent screams
A return to real bestiality
And to voodoo's insanity- VICTORIOUS PATH -

Scanned bodies fall to the ground
A flash by the blade as the sword cuts the speed of the sound 

And the titans shall scream and cry out
Valhallan warriors, masters of battle

We know our fate lies in the hands of the gods
Armed for battle, forces of fire and frost

Inside my dreams I have seen
My death, my glory and a life full of hatred

Trapped in a cage with my sword and my shield
Destiny calls so I'm flying away to the gods

Fight, We stand strong full of might
Victorious path we ride

Bearing the mark of destruction and triumph
Unchained and victorious we rise
Bursting the nightsky with red glowing metal
We march on the Road of the Light

Fight, We stand strong full of might
Victorious path we rideIn the primeval dark of earth-follows held in
high veneration with rites sacrificial

Bless them, all people, with silence

Gracious be, wish what the land wishes
Follow grave goddesses
Flushed in the flame sprung torchlight

Gay on your journey
Singing all follow our steps

Horns, Horns, oh high, oh aspiring
Daughters of night, aged children, in blithe processional
Bless them, all people, with silence

There shall be peace forever
Between these people of Pallas and their guests
Zeus the all-seeing met with Destiny to confirm it
Singing all follow our stepsSwarming heat makes clouds in frost 
Our breath triumphs in the wooden wombs 
Clasping at the men locked in combat 
Fodder for the gods' intent. 

The grey clouds shine the time is now 
Hit me with your finest swing of hungover welded steel 
I taste the bitter souring 
mead soaring through the wet ages. 

Make your blades, trudge the marshes 
This is the key to the journey through ages 
Not is the magic of candle and spite 
This is the magic of action and might!Iron runs like blood through our veins
Our will as strong as stone
Born to rule these lands
Not to serve foreign lords

Immune to the venom of your speech
Not a part of the worthless mob
Unspoiled by outlandish gold
Not bound by oaths made by bastards

This is our awakening,
The dawn of Germanic pride
Never kneeling like a victim
Well aware that might is right!

Behold, the hour has come
Feeble, the frail flock writhes
Shred to pieces by wolves;
Hate proved stronger than chains
Empires rise - and they all fall;
Especially those led by greed
Where one corrupt predator
Is eager to devour the next

This is our awakening,
The dawn of Germanic pride
Never kneeling like a victim
Well aware that might is right!

Burn! Empire of decadence!
Burn! Cesspool of iniquity!
Burn! Hotbed of degeneracy!
Burn! And silence will prevail ...
Burn!(Instrumental)Fiery woods and golden trees
are glittering beneath clear sky
silver mist at every morning
and lonely ravens scream up high

Beholding the great vast forest
I can see the colours of autumn
Nightly frost that made flowers withered
is silent messenger of whole life's doom

Melancholy mood within nature
I feel cool touch of upcoming snow
which is born somewhere in North
Northernmost at the end of the rainbow

The burning colours of autumn
such a beatiful garment for death
last flashing of once vitality
but already is to feel dying breath

Not long within further time
all what I see is in the grip of frost
that's the eternal circle of birth and death
but still I enjoy what soon shall be lost
the everlasting colours of autumn(Instrumental)Many times ago
Menschen were
the same

Masteras of creating 
their own graves

Many times
humans mercyless
onwards building
their new slaves

And many times 
in further Future 
will show us
the same

New orders drive
new deathmachines

Any force `till 
there`s no
barrier left

Without the one`s
in our head

As soon your life 
you lay aside

Down to your 
formal pride
down to your
formal pride

Humans are it`s
biggest fear
and blood the
only solution

To die i want you 
just like the others
a new world order
morders undercover
instead of me you`re 
going to suffer

SUFFER

Many times
humans mercyless
onwards building
their new slaves

And many times 
in further Future
will show us
the same

It has to be like it 
always was
mankind`s world is ruled
by inhuman discordBy lightning conceived was I
The stars above became my eyes
Hvergelmir flows in my veins
My hair the mist across the never ending nameless lake

By womb of soil, the moist of dew
Born when sun was high, the day was new
And the raven soared high up in clear sky
The lamb will speak to you, when your heart is pure
And you were made by

Mother Earth, Father Thunder

This heart winged, I am eagles son
Through storm and spite, untouched, it is pounding on
This sword, forged in fire and ice
The runes that trail its blade can be seen but by my two eyes

As if written in the snow, the lies, shall melt away
By the wheel of sun to cross the sky this day
Shadows may lay heavy upon the earth
But the truth, cut deep in stone, will last
Till the heavens comes tumbling down upon this world

Mother Earth, Father ThunderDark vast forest howls
A grave now open wide
More warriors of hate
Undying revenge!

Winter narrow secret
Wind that cannot been seen
Under a deeper wood with the pain
Wind that cannot been seen
Must die with every fear...

Wolves lurking insane
Chants rise in the night
Mortality dawn
Ruins of the vulgar ground

Winter narrow secret
Wind that cannot been seen
Under a deeper wood with the pain
Wind that cannot been seen
Must die with every fear...

That night we stand and fight
For the winter by the snow
Breathing, just breathing
The blood upon my sword
She have a mission
From the Realm of the North
Unmask the shadows of the warriors
Unto me...

Winter narrow secret
Wind that cannot been seen
Under a deeper wood with the pain
Wind that cannot been seen
Must die with every fear...Is a pale , frozen space , dead but still alive in my ancestral recall
an ancient castle made by mystic ice...by his portals an icy winds that slays the seed of life

Sideral Terror - a blue fire burns my eyes
Sideral Terror - a blue light blinds my mind

alone , in the dark , frozen by icy winds
I cry frozen blood , I scream for extreme pain

In the fire , in the darkness , with ancient rites they are calling my name 
from the darkness of centuries past
from the darkness of middle ages they are callin my name

Sideral Terror - a blue fire burns my soul
Sideral Terror - a blue light blinds my mind

alone , in the dark , warped by icy winds
I drink warm blood , I scream for extasy

This mystic ancient forest , always in my dreams...
whisperings of hate and sorrow desecrating winds...
embraced in darkness and sorrow , fueled by primal fury
I will walk again the forest where I died

Ahh...In the fire of ice enveloped by dense shadows...
In the darkness , undead , here...
In the forest where I diedWE CAME, WE CONQUERED, WE BROUGHT PURE DEATH
MERCHANTS OF HATRED, RAISED ONCE IN HELL

DELIVERING EVIL, FEAR CAUSE OUR NAME
NO GOD NOR MORTAL SHALL STAND IN OUR WAY(Instrumental)I came from the depths. 
 Sleeping in the waters, 
 Awaiting for my rising. 
 I destructor, I creator 
 Hear my voices calling from the center of the earth, 
 Take a sight into my boiling bowels. 
 Have you ever heed the announcement of the currents? 
 They call of havoc and loss! 
 They bode of me!I feel such pain, in my heart and in my soul
Tell me a prayer
I'll leave memories alone
Silence whispers in the rain
Can I put it all away?
Yes you are here while I cry

I will die for the King of the truth
Whether I bleed or dreams come true
Keep me alive and show me the way
I pray

I believe in fire, it is the heart of melody
You can feel the same, just look at His face
I am flying higher through the cathartic tears
Love will hold me up on dark days

Rise!
From the bottom
Rise!
Can you heal my wounds?
Survived and Resurrected
Wind will blow
Through eye of the storm

Road to the paradise
He said: I'll return

So many times I have failed in my life
I never hide what I have done wrong in your eyes
The cost of a human life was paid
He conquered the death and grave
Yes, you are here while I cry

I will die for the King of the truth
Whether I bleed or dreams come true
Keep me alive and show me the way
I pray

I believe in fire, it is the heart of melody
You can feel the same, just look at His face
I am flying higher, through the cathartic tears
Love will hold me up on dark days

Rise!
From the bottom
Rise!
Can you heal my wounds?
Survived and Resurrected
Wind will blow through eye of the storm

When I drown in a sea of lies I am afraid
But I know that you are with me
Let Him show how great He is and you will see
He will never let you go alone
He'll be your guide
I have a dream where I look for the door
Am I lost in time?
Oh wait for me there and always lead my mind
I am your Father, you'll do my will
Purpose of all, and passion to live
I am your Father, you'll do my will
Whispers of wind, you cannot see and hear
I am forever and more
If I live then I will die
It is the gate to the land of light
I can find you everywhere
You send me signs every day
The strongest passion of a human soul
Is to find you and open the door
Calling voices in your heart
The calm of the Creator has come
The Joy of the light!My Name Is Sigurd "The Bloody Axe"

I Be Contined My Fight, I Be Continued My FightGive me wings! I want to fly! 

Into the sky! In the endless expanses! 
breathe deeply ! 

Turn away from the world. Go to the endless sky. 
Stay alone with yourself and feel free. 
Leave behind all this dirt, world's dirty. 
Dirty souls of the people. 

Into the sky! In the endless expanses! 
Breathe deeply ! 

Look at the world differently. 
Make sure that it does not completely rotten. 
That there is hope for humanity. 
I do not need this self-deception. 
I'm a free partikle of this world. 
And your hearts so cold. 

To be alone with my thoughts. 
You are boring, each one of you. 
How many flaws. Humanity is the biggest mistake of nature. 
I do not need your beautiful words, I want to leave you forever. 

Your actions, your betrayal. 
Your fucking god, all your fucking gods. 
Create your ideals, worship them. 
And I'll fly. I am above you!Through space and time we travel
Through endless nights we soar
Passing the darkened horizons
Pitch-black mist
Eternal blackness surrounding
Starlight passing by
The universe everlasting what does exist

Far beyond the black field of stars
Through ancient voids, see who you are

Spiralling on through this dreamscape
Endless starlit black skies
A journey for a new sunlight glowing far
We see the lair of creator
Silhouettes of his domain
Empire of the great master
The burning star

Far beyond the black field of stars
Through ancient voids, see who you are
Far beyond the black field of stars
Through ancient voids, see who you areYou want some Hell
We go the Hell
We'll give you Hell tonight
We got the violence we got the force
It's all we know to do
Break out the chains rise up in flames
This time we'll come to you, cuz -
Burning until you can't burn no more
The wait is now all through
You've met your maker, soul taker
This time he's come to you, cuz -Vergangenheit holt uns ein  - 
Erinnerung an die Alten - 
die einst sassen auf dem Thron 
Und es lebt auf - wir sind derer viele 
Im Zeichen der Raben: 
Es ist unsere Zeit!The seventh day they gained at last the shore,
The shore that lies far other side the sea,
The seventh day, I say, since firstly bore
A wave offences from humanity.
They drew the ship aground on a land sore
That lifeless lay as far as eye could see,
If not for few contorted trees that grew
In mists which smelt like bones and wet mildew.

Hanged to the branches, swinging in the air
Slowly, like thuribles of incense dead,
One thousand sacks of cloth of human hair
A skeleton wrapped up in their grim thread.
In awe the three begun there to wayfare
Among the fruits of such still garden sad.
Where cadavers curled up within their tomb
Like fetuses inside a sterile womb.

Few mossy stones were scattered all around,
In strange signs carved, unknown to the human host,
Surfacing here and there in the wet ground.
Decay and death had set their reign utmost
Upon that somber land where not a sound
Was heard besides the breathing of the coast.
The air was thick and seemed to suck their breath,
As the Three trode upon the land of death.In a dark night flames came out of the village church
As strong that nobody could put them out
A figure came out full of endless hate
Destroying everything that dirty Christians built
The village people tried to flee
But they were all slaughtered
When the church was destroyed
The figure disappeared in a clearing -
It had never existed -
Only a slack of ash was leftThrough the First Age's course
by the mines at the earth's core
A blade of fire was forged
That shone with the light of Sun and Moon
Banishing darkness and fear
By the Second Age's war
in the year 3441
a Last Alliance was formed
That night, on the plain, were elves and men
and Narsil, the sword of the King

All leaders fell, but Sauron's spirit fled
The remnants told the tale of the broken sword

The shards, preserved
were kept in Rivendell
awaiting for the heir
Numenorean, Eagle of the Star
Chieftain of the Dunedain

Elrond foretold
The sword wouldn't be reforged
Until the ring was found
and the Shadow returned
Then the blade of Elendil
would return to Minas Tirith

The day has come! We're marching off to war
Up from the ashes, your light shall guide us

Flame of the West, soaring unstained
Unextinguishable sun of wisdom
Reforge the sword, as deadly as of old
Your seven stars shall gleam in battleLyric by Abyssius

A new war will be executed it was declared!!!
And to the warriors that struggle
They combat and they die
For the spirit of the wolf...
It just remains the honor!

Through the pagan circle
In our blood the truth
That is was buried the ancestors close to

Now we have the chance
Of destroying the false faiths
We will change like this
The historical direction of this fucking catholic world

Strong Blood - The Pagan Pride
Strong Blood -  A New War
Strong Blood - A War Against Merciful God

The old traditions of our people will be reborn
And the flag of the Pagan Blood will triumph

A new war will be executed it was declared!!!
And to the warriors that struggle
They combat and they die
For the spirit of the wolf...
It just remains the honor!

When churches will be in ruins and ashes
The duty will be accomplishedAenhoort... dees vertelselcken dat wulder besinghen

the bonds of devotion 
and set free the horror 
that is inner emptiness 

i shook with earthly disease 
and i bowed down 
for all that's precious must die 
and restless rivers run dry 

how could my eyes be 
so restlessly deceived 
by the one thing thats pure 
i renounce my being 

why am i left to lose 
the one matter that is all 
of my poorest possessions 
which lie in ruins 

where great trees once reigned 
stumps of wood stand flamed

and restless rivers run dry 

how could my eyes be 
so restlessly deceived 
by the one thing thats pure

i won't be gone, i will belong

which is you and me

in ignorant safety you dwell 
while i lie cold 
with strangling fear 
yet i have peace in mind 
for only death will take

i will succeed, 
and make you my everythingCities in ruins as ashes still burn
Chaos is created, there's no return
Leftovers of overkill, mayhem and pain
A legacy of blood, death's to remain

Remnants of war - a dying world
Remnants of war - into the gore

Visions of brutality, total catastrophe
Incineration, destruction are scars of the cruelty
Everything in debris, all life seems to end
Annihilation - the summon of the dead

Remnants of war - a dying world
Remnants of war - into the gore

Threnody of the survivors, mourning the fallen
Terror and fear and torment, so much is stolen

Remembrance for those who have given their lives
Into the dead silence only heard the cries

Remnants of war
A dying world
Into the gore
Total warSo, I couldn't find the highway
 Buildings around, places I can't stay
 Faces again, see me here 
 Faith that can only feel fear
 A cute golden ecstasy in my arms 
 A silent melody through my palms
 A smooth chainsaw in my head 
 A book that can't be read

 Alive 
 Never felt so good today 
 I feel that I'll die today
 Alive 
 My head is about to break 
 All is done now
 I'm alive 
 Never felt so good today

 Alive

I don't have faith anymore 
 I don't have a needle anymore
 I can't fly so high anymore 
 I can't even feel me, sore
 Delete my mind so I can change 
 Remove my thoughts so I can stay
 Gimme the gun so I could change 
 Gimme the gun so I could stay

 Die today 
 Die todayA realm there is, inaccessible to the Nobles
Outside the feelings of the blind Atlantians
Inaccessible, yet real
Imperceptibly find its way to the Land of- Conquerors

The hidden realm is a fusty land
Zog is its hideous master
He rests at the riches once stolen
From the Noble Warriors and their People

Zog is one but composed of vermin
Only vermin dwells in his estate
But he rules also those creatures
To which his name is unknown

Many heads of saurian drip venom of blindness
And opium of masses
He wields the drug of illusions and colourful- pictures
Thus the world denied his existence

But lo! Not every Atlantians stays sleeping
Some still serving the hidden betrayer
Eagerly they prepare the drug
'Cause they strive for saurian's good graces

But lo! The Nobles stay up
There are Hammers at their necks
They fight the betrayer's priests
They struggle to awake their brothers from slumber

For their fight against the rule of the saurian -
Hail to Them! And Glory till DeathI was awake by a soft howl's whistle
nesting an old oak standing as the throne.
in the glare of the growing rising sun
I rode my steed still ready for a turn.
all the beauty I could see along my way
takes root in our pure legacy for long.
time is for me now to be left behind
only this catchy song remains in my mind.

wisdom is the true heart of my ancestors
who fought one day to defend my fate
who died one day to go through the gate
who rose one day to the sky
when I will die one day I shall meet them
when I will fight and lose my life
when I will die one day I shall meet them
when I will fight


leading me to the brightest prophecy
for all of us one day to reach the liberty
on a land without grave or any grief,
feasting forever with brothers and valkyries.
along my way I will keep singing this song
before the sun is down my journey will be done
to honor warriors and ancestors
and raise for them a great and tall rune stone

Chorus

from the place they all have fallen
I can hear the call of the god of war,
surrounded with helmets and broken arrows
they fought bravely until their last dawn.
for them I stand where they all passed away
their bravery is now engraved on the stone
their death is engraved on my memory
for them I will fight again until my last dawn.Poenam no sentio mortis, poena fuit vita, requies mihi morte parata est

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine

I am sitting here alone, tortured and prisoned in my cell
I am sitting here alone, tortured and prisoned in my cell
Chains binding my hands and feets, I feel I am in hell
Chains binding my hands and feets, I feel I am in hell

Never did I something wrong
Everyday I prayed to God

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine

Live is dark and savage now, they blamed me as a witch
Live is dark and savage now, they blamed me as a witch
Years and years I healed the people, with the help of nature's power
Years and years I healed the people, with the help of nature's power

Never did I something wrong
Everyday I prayed to God

I remember when I was young and the fields and the trees surrounding me
As a maid on a farm there was nothing bad and evil for me
All the terrible thing they said, my skin was burnt with fire
My life is turning into red, the inquisitions desire

I remember when I was young and the fields and the trees surrounding me
As a maid on a farm there was nothing bad and evil for me
All the terrible thing they said, my skin was burnt with fire
My life is turning into red, the inquisitions desire

I have to got to the pyre now, all my bones are broken
They spite on me - No help no angels here - I cannot flee
I am confined to a pile - tears of pain running from my eyes
The flames devour me, my fate is black

My fate is black
My fate is black

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine(Instrumental)Elders Poem
(music by Nathuruss, Vidar, lyrics by Vidar)

Raised by the knowledge breaking the walls,
In spirit of darkness, falling asleep,
As prophets of coincidence, process of birth,
Falling too high, yet rising too deep.
The raging wolves with the jaws of glass
When questioning the wiser to step back,
By thoughts driven fear we shall rule,
Ours defend, foreign attack!
Samo reborn, the legions let march!
Wogastisburg of our hearts.
...Wogastisburg of our hearts...

Homewards, Vesna lead my steps
My lungs to fill with your breath,
On the wings of Phoenix, take me there,
Where solstices and thunder flare
All men as one, together hail...

Rhyme for the verse, the one eyed old man's curse,
Bleeding promises that failed...
Rebellion of no clues, the give and the loose,
Last requiem that failed...
We walked the same common path
Where am I supposed to find you now?
A poem for my lonesome wrath
How am I supposed to fight it now?

Combien faut-il de fois secoueI knelt to the almighty justice
Kneeling day in the most dark
Yes great fun biggest Sakitkan
Bring the dark souls into my body
You give condolences
Honor that you Sakitkan
Wait time off my feeling
Vision of the end of the black death eve
My heart is imprisoned by sin heart
Under torture recognition with black sins
Karmaku for my sins
For my sins previous
Something departing from death
Now I'm live
Burn of light black
Night to end burn
By the end of my dead rest
But will remain in case of life
Selaras life and deathI will return
I'm a creature of the night
I am a vampire
And I bite
At night I will come to your house

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself

I will bite into your neck
To suck your blood
Out of your vein
Soon you will be dead

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself

Stick a pale into my heart
Then you have saved of your life just a part
Hear my evil symphony

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourselfThrice, ten thousand men lying
Of cold, of thirst,
And hunger dying,
In dread pits of idol clay
Where flesh submits to foul decay,
Like madmen howling,
In dark blood crawling,
Foemen, strangers,
Thickly clustering,
In drifts of smoke,
Silently suffering,
I follow the dreams,
That seek the grave
As I walk
The moonless fens of a darkling day.(Instrumental)We were few in numbers 
But many in pride and strength
Not only only fighting to live 
But also for our beliefs
With swords risen 
We attacked with no mercy

As the strength runs low
I take the hammer in my hand
Remeber what we are fighting for
Blood runs warm from wounds deep 
Never been this strong before
I recieve power from the hammer of thor

As the strength runs low
I take the hammer in my hand
Remeber what we are fighting for
Blood runs warm from wounds deep 
Never been this strong before
I recieve power from the hammer of thor

We gave them no chance 
Except retreat
They faced a grim defeat 
Their warriors were defated 

As the strength runs low
I take the hammer in my hand
Remeber what we are fighting for
Blood runs warm from wounds deep 
Never been this strong before
I recieve power from the hammer of thor

As the strength runs low
I take the hammer in my hand
Remeber what we are fighting for
Blood runs warm from wounds deep 
Never been this strong before
I recieve power from the hammer of thor

As the strength runs low
I take the hammer in my hand
Remeber what we are fighting for
Blood runs warm from wounds deep 
Never been this strong before
I recieve power from the hammer of thorAwakened by the fall of dust
Fade into the dead of night
Raging battles in mystical forests
As Odin's ravens now take flight
Nocturnally they see the empty souls
The valkyries shall carry you home
Forever embraced by Thor's Hammer
As thunder is etched into runestones

And for those who don't believe say...
You will never live to see another day!

As dawn draws its final curtain
The darkness falls so spread your wings
A bloodshed victory, heroes of eternity
The gifts that pagan gods will bring
And as you fly away from the light
Bereft as you take your last breath
Blood and honour, strength and power
There is never no fear of death

And for those who don't believe say...
You will never live to see another day!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)JOURNEY THROUGH A DARK MIST


A dark mist covers the moonlight, 
As so, it blinds our view, 
But we keep struggling to break through, 
And unveil the path of darkness. 

Unholy and pagan chants we hear, 
Screams and laments follows us, 
Hate and repulse hit us, 
No matter what, we stand in our feet, 
And keep fighting against it. 

Darkness fills our path, 
Mist blinds us, 
Screams deafen us, 
Hate tries to slay us, 
But all of that make us stronger and stronger. 

The throne, with the horned one awaits us, 
The dark embrace is near, 
Thy power of darkness guides us, 
So many secrets are there for us to unveil. 

We'll be on guard to raise our swords, 
Raise them against those who stole our pure lands, 
Raise them against the false prophet that corrupted our world, 
We'll raise them when we defeat the rotten god and his inferiors, 
Only our journey will end, 
And when our journey ends, we'll sing the pagan chant of victory.Fell the call upcoming the earth

Watch your steps
hours of way left
so be it, a journey
through yourself

To a finish can`t be reached
with your body, warm flesh
a journey of the mind 
as one path shares itself

You devide your presence
the body is now an offer
for leaving through the gate
a gift, an offering
for the craving frost

Can you feel him
on his blade you lie
turning with each breath
more and more
in you

Your needs into it`s opposite
become ypour mind
cleanse your soul
with the pure, real ice

One again
with a spirit
once lost
unwasted
an unbentI am the Omega, the end(Instrumental)Vesper sweet...
The charity that the devil only gives
Limbo deep...
As he hides the blade inside the tongue of priest
Deliver me in vanity and promise me you'll never let me back
Else vulture 'til the end...

The throat into the nowhere, the dark demonic wisp
A chamber rather fragments whose creatures charming hiss
The curves into beginning, a lunacy beveled
A poem of empty phrases, as bloody as I spell
The rapture and the choking, a rope on timber faith
The syringe and the angles in pale syphilic taint
I crave those motherfuckers, the jesus' children choir
Illuminating tiled walls all splattered with the gore...

The slumer in return
A long still sleep of fiery craving
Can't resist the sense enslaving
A bliss to yearn
Oh
A play of dream in somber theatre
Princess and rats beneath her
A bliss to burn...

Awaken with tide of the pain
Like cumming the serpents...

There must be a way out of this!
There must be a way out of this!

Shattered in grief we shall mourn one another
And sooner we find our spirits together
A chamber of limbo, arms tied Akimbo
A twosome like single when slaying themselves...

Who's wearing the treachery then?
When soaking on flowers we lay
Tenebri omnium pacis abbas

A message drawn with the bleeding wrist
A fettered pass of Adonis
Lines of finest crimson shade
Expressionism:Razorblade
Poetry that the demons read
Opium and the jimsonweed
The limbs of dying wweak by thirst
A blossom yearining not to burst

Vesper sweet...
The charity that the devil only gives
Limbo deep...
As he hides the blade inside the tongue of priest(Instrumental)The years go by and
time is running like a river flows
never to stop
the leaves are
falling down these days
and I remember what I've lost
As I said goodbye to you
Can't know it was
the last farewell
so much to say
so much to tell
It was the last farewell....

Asking you how, asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are

Asking you how, asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are

I was devastated as I heard
you gone away
Saw in your white cold face
no more time to stay
You told me how to live
you showed me how to fight

I always look up to you
I always be with you
I always look up to you

Asking you how
asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are

Asking you how
asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will forget
who you are(Instrumental)What is the false and what is correct?
Am i the only man who left persistent?
The years of struggle fading in memories.
Where is despaired, your famous resistance?

And after many years I have this bad felling.
That everything's gone and slowly falling down.
For your titles just I am deserving.
Am I only man who hears the wrong sound?

In leaderless resistance I can see the leaders
Others are losers, they are always winners
They are killing our dream and the revolution
Movement with them is filled with confusion

Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground
While the enemies are getting our streets and town
The so called leaders are tearing the fight down
Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground

Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground
While the enemies are getting our streets and town
The so called leaders are tearing the fight down
Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground

We were like the family till they had come
We were the strongest during all the time
But betrayal became their plan and success
They sold our movement! What is next?

And after many years I have this bad felling.
That everything's gone and slowly falling down.
For your titles just I am deserving.
Am I only man who hears the wrong sound?

In leaderless resistance I can see the leaders
Others are losers, they are always winners
They are killing our dream and the revolution
Movement with them is filled with confusion

Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground
While the enemies are getting our streets and town
The so called leaders are tearing the fight down
Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground

Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground
While the enemies are getting our streets and town
The so called leaders are tearing the fight down
Our famous resistance - destroyed to the ground.You know Death is coming
It's fast on your back
The Reaper's got your name
The winds are blowing
Your losing your track
You wish you'd never came

We are alive
Here for the ride
Blood in your eyes
It's a sacrifice

You try to fight
At midnight you fall
We'll krush and burn your face
You had no right as we heard
The masters call to banish you
From this place

Now you're in hell
And ready to please
Yeah you're no use to me
We bid you farewell and done with sleeze
We'll watch you burn you'll see(Instrumental)(Instrumental)These Boundaries Crossed

In the morning light something stirred awake
From an overcast dawn  a grey doom yawned
Though a world remains as aeons pass on
The will come a day when all will be gone

One day will humble all
By dusk your world will fall
Into a womb to recreate
To turn forever and seal your fate

Time has passed for this world to heal
Nevermore will it repeal
So abandon the path you wander on
For as darkness is born so is our dawn

A black host came near
She whispered 'have no fear'
Time has come so on black wings we ride
To the end of all things, to the ancient's kings

Dark masters of light procreate with hammers of might
Stone cities rise from the ground
From a haunting silence their voices resound

Far before your race was sown
This earth belonged to the one with horns
Ruled in fairness, not in pride
No falseness was there to hide

The war reaped a fertile land
A burning hell turned the world to sand
No drop of rain fell from the sky
The leaders cowered beneath their lies

The fell consumed and abandoned hope
With burning hatred slashed their leaders throats
Nothing left but a lingering sorrow
A dead future, no more tomorrow

In this place of pain a great sadness brought the rain
And a lifeless sunset sank and sighed

After an eternity of blasting wind and ice
A parting cloud shot a ray of sun
Foreshadowing a newborn time

On the wings of destiny cries a memory lost
Who will remember tomorrow
These times gone by
These boundaries CrossedVelvet dreams of ebon darkness
Swirling like shadows, sepulchral and warm
Nightborn phantoms rend me painless
To a thousandfold aspects of blackness I'm torn

Sands of time are running backwards
To ages enshrouded by vast cloaks of gloom
Translucent tnedrils stretching outwards
Transcending the threshold of yesterday's doom

I wander landscapes godforsaken
Though crosses loom into an uncaring sky
Corpses decay 'long the paths I had taken
For sins born out of their hearts they had died

Ash clouds on red horizons gather
Emitting from stakes illuminating the night
For spirit, son and holy father
Their hot, cleansing fire's devouring my bride

The saviour's sheep now flock the scaffold
Their hypocrite faces are frozen in glee
Witness my loved one's torture untold
Our unison wailing in agony

And as the thirteenth candle flickered
My past life laid plain as a book before me
I'll walk in wrath amongst the wicked
Preach Christendom's fall into eternity(Instrumental)Chaos and snow
Cover the land
Death is all I see, Ashes of my enemy

War and plunder
Storm and thunder
Death is all I see, ashes of my enemy

Closer to the end, closer to new shores,
A greater winter no one has ever seen before
Death is all I see, ashes of my enemy

Black winds blowing and lightning in the sky
Set sail and leave fear behind
Once and for all

Warhammer
Two handed sword
In these times of war
Are like olden friends
The best of all

Feel the anger, feel the hate
The path I chose led me to this fate

Though I know I will soon be gone
My last joy is to see them burn
To see them fall(Instrumental)Spopod hustin , spomienkou davnou
na prahu noci, v srdci mociarov.
Zapachom zhnitym , do hmlistej rise
kde narek nemy smrt ukolise.

Vonou strachu, do hlbky bahna
prepadne slabost, slabych davna.
Pre slepotu (zo) stromov, nespatria lesy
pre nicotu v ociach, kricia zabudnute hlasy.

Jantarom doby, zableskom hviezd
ostavaju ciny vodcov ciest
Ostatkom doby, stada a zver
nasledovat slepo, mrtvy to smer

Ku bahnam mociarov...Shining rays of the dawn pierce the grey veil of the horizon
Betrayal and coldness
Spirits have withdrawn to the underworld
No longer can you hear the voices of ancestors
no longer can you feel what you used to feel

In the world without visions, those above will live and perish
Cursed pagan gods take their gifts back
Cheat were the mind and heart of blind poor the eld
perhaps once wise, honest and generous man.

Good or evil, death makes no choice
time is unrelenting, death makes no choice

Much is forgotten, away, like childhood dreams you sacrificed
I can hear the song again, cried by ravens since ages
To the fallen leaves of autumn days
Maybe it is the last time, who knows ....
however, the glory stay for all the time
Here on land or everywhere else

.. I can hear the song again, cried by ravens since eternities
Wandering through the mist,
Carried by the wind.....(Instrumental)No feast at the table
My master and brothers are all lost
No one left able
To toast to the gods
Remember thy father
My sword will aveng him at all costs
Doomed to wonder this age of chaos

Watch well what your tongue speaks
When making an oath unto the gods
Be prepared to bleed
All lies have their cost
I sail the seven seas
In search of the dreams that have been lost
Cursed to wander this age of chaos

Each night I do ponder
I gaze at the stars and sing my song
Destined to wander
This age of chaosFather Neptune leaves our land
And opens wide the Seas
The lukewarm breeze does beckon me 
As it whispers though the trees 
(it says) Set your force and let me 
take your power to the shores
Take Farewell of those near you
And your land of the Seas The wild cold blue deep Ocean waves Invite my hungry heart
Cry not my love I will return
Only death can keep us apart
Neptune in waters cold and deep
Let the power of yours fly To guide us on our sail to the forgotten shores
The wind blows thought my pallid face 
And fills our sails with hope
Caress these lines of OAK winds
Do not throw us all to die The wild cold blue deep Ocean waves As high as the sky above
Come to us Gods of the Sea
Don't take us down beckon
Carrying cold steel at our side 
No time to lose on earth
We attack the ground by surprise
Down the coast lines 
With the water we reign
Gods of Water lightning rain
The winds of fury
whispers our name
Pounding, Pounding 
of hoofs and wheels
forks of water 
At your heals Swords of steel
Held up high Darkened strikes
From blackened skies
Seeds and honey 
Milk and blood 
Sacrifice to the Water God
Centuries of pain and sorrow
Created by christian race
Detonated by our tribe
Is now another world 
Another place"Enter arrival; inscription cut in stone
Naked stone within this cursed domain
The evil that darkness incarnates great
Embodied sin on plane under the dome
Realm I've called my home and shelter

Against their will they bear one stigma
Ruins upon their hearts for their master
Remnant of enigma to invite a disaster
In his wake lay souls he holds as prior
Vault of disease where he holds prior
Vault of disease where he is the gov
Archway to her is burned out agenda
Love is lost forever, now enter arrival"O, fathers I saw you
Your faces of stone
Your eyes in the fires of our camp
Your words are our native tongue
Your voices the winds in the fields
Your cloaks the leaves upon the trees
Today sleep must now end
You told me so, I felt it all

Rivers of blood
The crescent is burning
They run on our soil
I swear I will turn 'em all to ash

The lion's cage is broken
The beast is loose
The faithful were lasted for centuries
Their April's our blood red flower
The poisoned soil is open
To take them all at once
O, fathers I'm standing
My sword is my word

Rivers of blood
The crescent is burning
They run on our soil
I swear I will turn 'em all to ash

The heavens they speak to me
O, the rivers and the soil
O, they're angry
We've been waiting
For too long

The fires in our camp
We are gathered around them
Wait for a signal
We've been waiting
For too longWelcome to the obscene 
A carnival fest you've never seen
Fille with desire and comfort in pain
where no man can resist

convince yourself and step right in
Comfort yourself for you know it's a sin
give in to your most selfish emotions
And enter a world of oblivion

Misfits and freaks are welcoming you
Into this brothel filled with decay
Where all hope for salvation
Is just fading away

Brace yourself 
And step right in
The trip of a lifetime
Is about to begin

Whores and Gents, please cast away
Your last bit of pride and decency
Lean back and enjoy the ride
You're the one we'll sacrifice tonight

Your most perverted skills
won't satisfy your greedy mind
All is set for you to leave it all behind this time

My insanity is growing inside me
It's the delight of failure
Amorphous creatures are laughing and dancing
Leaving their marks to defeat me

The stench is draining my sense of reality
These images burn inside

Silhouettes of pure demise
Are roaming through the night
Echoes of insanity
The splendour of evil inside

Your most perverted skills
won't satisfy your greedy mind
All is set for you to leave it all behind one final time

Ladies and gentlemen step right in
And embrace yourself for the trip of a lifetime
Give in to your most intimate desires
And enter this realm of lust
Unlike all others places
Welcome to the carnival of miscreation
Where pure sensation is quite a lie(Instrumental)- MEGALOMAN -

Hurricane of fire, flame of Megalopolis
Fighting for all mankind,
He's the chosen last Mane king 

Black blood tribe is planning conquest
Of the planet Earth
He's the one who wields the power
Master of starforce

Megaloman

Mystical bladefighter, swinger of the firesword
Cybernetic warrior, ruler from a distant star

Captain Dagger's sending monsters
From the evil dome
Towns are crushed and torn in chaos,
Screaming out their call

Megaloman

Mighty mane's the final weapon, deflagrating force
Iron masked champion, rider of the firestorm

Shining bracelets, freedom fighters
Guardians of the world,
Crossed arms unleash the powers
Surging one and all

Megaloman(Instrumental)(Instrumental)When this world has come to an end 
and all life faded away
when all the gods have died
and only chaos remains

When the sun sank below into the sea
what will be left
when the final battle has been fought?

Will there be new life
born into a new world?
Will there be new light
born out of darkness?

What life will have meant
if we ceased to exist?
Is there a second spring
for our kind in sight?

As this world ends
the cycle will be closed
the dawning of a new golden age
born from Ragnaroks flamesLive and letting live is easy as long as you waer the crown,
And who would shamelessly attack
When your castle's draw-bridge is down?
Enlightenment, almighty guardian against the tide,
Everything is relative, there is no wrong or right.
But if I could I'd take a torch and change your cretin ways,
I'd set your dead-end dreams of peace and love ablaze,
I drill your fucking skulls with the power of dogmatic facts,
And in the state of pain you shall see back...

Tolerance, pathetic excuse for being a slave,
For being the 21. century in a Europe of the weak.
Ignorance, a ruler's first step towards the guillotine,
The last, a desperate act to revive the fading ruins of the truth.

Bring once more the spirit of manhood forth
Remind the world of the existence of west and north,
Follow the call of the union.
You may not know, but your fate still lies still in your hands,
Raise your head, break free from the mental chains,

The spirit of what is yours burned down to the core,
The scarred and swollen face of Europe, nevermore.
You may look away, but your children will not...
...inherit your myth of "what you give is what you get",
Will mereky find that Christianity has yet again failed...

The spirit of what is yours burned down th the core,
Making way for a globe without borders, lands or shore,
One space, one culture, one tongue,
One last act of self-destruction to come...

The rules of old state that fire is replied by fire,
The pacifist is god? Upon a pike with liar!
Hang'em high those cunts who for too long have owned your minds,
Hang'em high...still is the power yours.(Instrumental)A line of fire
Flickers on mist enshrouding knees
Hooded carriers of torches file
Through the dark and twisted trees

The trees, the forest
The trees in the forest

We worshiped in sacred groves
Effigies on wooden poles
Whispering with dead souls
I once did this

Scuffing through groves
That whisper old songs
And riddles to solve
We longed for the mead hall
The symbel and boast

To walk and crackle through the soft bracken
I see what this hidden world was for
And what it meant to the heathen mind
A gateway to interaction with Gods
I acknowledge my bloody past
Of sacrifice within these trees
It is part of us
And so I return here
In modern ways
Drink to the evolution
Of our new heathen hearts!

Woden!

The trees, the forest
The trees in the forestThe graves been opened for all to see
You'd like to take that trip huh? Well you just might be
Your days of waste are through
I've come to see that
Blood, pain all for you that's where it's at
The bones are burning the smell is sweet
Ashes are piled so high it's nothing discreet
The ram's sliced open and ripe the time is now to strike
Strike of Midnight - don't try to fight
Strike of Midnight - feel the bite
The horns are in your side death starts its course
Your weakness is now over with no remorse
Your life means nothing to me and with that I'll take it
It's not insanity I'll just disgrace it
I've seen the dead you're just like them
I'll take your soul and have it condemnedI'm right here
Waiting for another chance
Fighting against all fears
Passion in the heart
New sensations surround me
There are new worlds to discover

Through your shadows
They can see this man
With his doubts and certainties

I've always tried
To be honest with myself
Learning from mistakes
Seeking the truth
Behind every corner
Breaking down walls of lies

Through your shadows
They can see this man
With his victories and defeats

Hold your dreams and live your life
Run away from here and don't stop now
Rekindle hope
Find a way to go on
Take the power from your soul and try
Until your last goodbye

I'm right here
Under the weight of my choices
Leaving the past behind
There's a light in the dark
There's an answer to my questions
This is the time to rise again

Through your shadows
They can see this man
With his illusions and emotions

Hold your dreams and live your life
Run away from here and don't stop now
Rekindle hope
Find a way to go on
Take the power from your soul and try
Until your last goodbyeSon, I feel love 
Son, I feel hate 
But my dreams fly 
There where someone bad 
Power fails to see 

Son, my tears sue 
Indifference such as you 
Incurable inane egoism 
Breeds to bad, god and the fascism 

I see dark 
I see light 
My tears sue 
Such as youIn the age of darkness
The shadows of the cowards fall
Evil thoughts try to stop us
and kill me

Angel of destruction
Sweep the filth away
Erase corruption
And make me free

The beginning of the battle to
Defend our ideals,
In the mighty clash of army
We'll survive again

Fire!
Burn in the
Battlefield!
Purify our souls
Before the Chasm
The magic song is my guide

We are freeborn against the world
Fighting forever the Dark Mighty Lord
We are soldiers of twilight
Standing together against our Fate

For your acts, your name will survive again
Another sacrifice was made for sacred cause
Time has come for all to raise the heads and fight
After the fall of grace, our scream resounds tonight

Hundreds thousands of phantoms 
are storming my mind
Madness tries to tame me 
but my soul is too strong

We are freeborn against the world
Fighting forever the Dark Mighty Lord
We are soldiers of twilight
Standing together against our FateYou of this age
different it be
for the first time of an age
man has the technology to destroy
the earth and the egotism to
posses the power without fear

Mans capacity for destruction
global disregard for this earth
a living being which sustains us
pollution a gripping reality
one which is killing us both
physically and spiritually
but so slowly it goes unnoticed
out of sight 
out of mind

seemingly clear air fills our lungs
water from industrial waste that appears clear
imbalance caused by careless
slaughter of rain forests and their inhabitants
mankind is capable of killing the planet
and is selfishly, blindly doing so.(Instrumental)Opened the portals to the worlld beyond
Emerging from the shadows
The wind carries their whispering
Echoes from days of old

As the summer leaves
And life fades away
The spirit of the dead
Awaits to return

Autumn fires are burning
To light their ways
Sacred this night is
When boundaries of life and death disappear

When the dead leave their realm
To touch the world of mortals
For some of us to hear

When the dead leave their realm
To touch the world of mortals
For some of us to see

When the dead leave their realm
To touch the world of mortals
Just a few will understand

Let the fires burn bright
To guard their ways
Closing the circle of life and death
This night belongs to the dead...(Instrumental)1. Awaiting...
(music and lyrics by Vidar)

As the evening spells were whispered,
and invoking words were told
the flames from the embers arose
by silent trees which were behold
then a prophet, a wise man said...

I see a beast, burning down our temples,
Under a symbol of a cross-nailed man,
Killing our children, for we're all pagans, 
He's not too far, from where now we stand...

And as Luna hid her silhouette behind the clouds,
From the dark, a christian stepped out...Wolves are howling in the night
Seeking prey to fulfill bloodlust
In my soul I am brother to them
With a lust to battle
If only winds carried the dream
A promise of a new pagan dawn
To rise and vanquish this era
Era of false belief

What do we do with Jesus???
A prophet from the desert
In our mighty old forests
Full of ancient mysteries
We must return the day of glory
Honour to the ancestors
Under the same dark sky
They once worshipped the gods

Built upon pagan temples
And sacrificial saacred sites
Hollow churches of an alien god
We must burn them all
Wolves are howling at the dawn
Blood has flown once more
In my soul I am free with them
It's in my heathen natureMy Name Is Sigurd "The Bloody Axe"
I Am A Northerner And Take Pride That
I Am A Viking I Pray For Odyn And Thor
I Am A Warrior, Northern Winds Calls Me To War
Northern Wind Help Me Sweep Unbelievers Out Of Existence
And He Sing Me Batlle Song For My Great War Dance
Churches Of My Enemies Burning, Smoke Of
Conflagration Turned Sky Into Black Colour
Black Sky - It's A Great Symbol Of True War
And Until Black Sky Over My Head, Until
Northern Wind Filled Out Drakkar Salls
I Be Contined My Fight, I Be Continued My FightThe Abode of the Gods Where Dwell the Brave Fallen in Battles The Warrior Only Victory Or Death by the Sword On Palaces of Gold The Glories of Eternal Life With the Gods

In the cold forests
Battles of blood are fought
The hordes queued plan the attack
Deep within our warriors lies the thrill of death
The enemy marches to battle

In the deep silence of darkness
From the Shadows of the earth
The battle for command
Power flows through our swords
Under the moonlight the pagan blade shines
See the flaming arrows
That cross the battlefield

Blood in the wind, death in the air
Warriors march for the battle

Raise your weapons, fight with glory
Retake the pagan throne

The final blow, blood in your face
Your body dilacerated in battle
The final blow
In your hands the blood of enemies
Your body enters a pit of flames

The wolves are fed the flesh of enemies
Bodies thrown into the pile of remains
Rotting corpses
The smell of death spreads everywhere
Death has come to the noble warrior

The enemy fire is still present
The black mist blurred vision
The eyes try to touch the stars
But the clouds are too gray

Inside the certainty of victory
In his hands the blood of the enemy
In the game created by the Gods
They decide who should die

The fate belongs to the gods of war
Your destination is the fervor of battle
Dying for your kingdom
Enforcing the death by the sword

His brothers are waiting on the other side
To celebrate the eternal life
Raise your swords noble warriors
Hail the gods of war!(Instrumental)I stand before the crowds of slaves 
 Poor bastards thinking they are free 
 I hear the clank of their faith 
 To fabled god of selfish dreams 

 Fake believers 
 The truth I deliver 
 Leading the blind 
 To the end of mankind 

 I sermonize the Word of Truth 
 But they are waiting for the tricks 
 The only food for scant belief 
 Like testimony for the weak 

 Fake believers 
 The truth I deliver 
 Leading the blind 
 To the end of mankind 

 This Spire goes through the worlds 
 The Tree of ten Sephirot 
 Here I crucify myself 
 My mind transmits to outer space 

 They need a wizard not a priest 
 Who turns the water into wine 
 And loosing blood in fight with Beast 
 But in three days returns to life 

 I rise upon the throne of flesh 
 Channeling to another dimension 
 My faith transforming to Will 
 The final stage of procreation 
 The God 

 I have the miracle they worth 
 Hard Iron Hammer of the truth 
 Wide opened eyes becoming curse 
 With lash of fears I am leading forthWithin subconcious deeps
yet slumbering
the spark of gods
remains of the times past

For all eternity
guiding our paths
from hidden places
throughout the centuries

Beyond life
beyond deathMy life is a flight across the azure skies
I'm soaring in elation
And swooping into the blood-red sunset
Not to lose my strength
In the landscape of my Mind I roam
Throught the places of my dreams
In a vast stretch of perpetual inspiration
Without the chaos of our time or people like you
I spread my wings only when I want to
Im not delirious I just have slightly different views
No one speaks in vain here
No issues and no misunderstandings
Everything is clear, gracious
And surprising in its eternal beautyA new world has opened
a world among the stars
I have now found my star
and it will be my new home
until the end of my stargate vision
Among the star I rest now
it's the time of silent
Only the sound of falling stars
break the silent
Only in my dreams exist this world
It's just wonderful to hover
in the empty space
No feelings for humanity
a perfect world for me
I wish it last forever
This world made from depths
of the darkest space of mind
Such vision of deathview
I search now for my death
and meet the shadow worldDaily life, an inconvenient burden
A winding road we all have to take
Sorrow, stress and numbing fear are overwhelming me
Guide me through these cloudy days so I can regain control

Embrace your soul to regain control
To silence your fear
Embrace your soul to regain control
The moment is near

You drag yourself through dark and anxious places
You blame your god for mistakes nobody made
Questions asked, answers hiding in plain sight
Doors they close, reflections of a truth once so bright

Cry so lonely / I tried so hard to please
Try so slowly / I try to find my peace

Fearing these moments of confrontation
Cleaning my mind to avoid my frustration

Give up your contaminated disguise
Disinfect your intoxicated eyes
Look through the mirror of ilusions
Look through the mirror at the man behind(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Der Zug der Wolkenfrauen
Der Zug der Wolkenfrauen
Der Zug der WolkenfrauenGlaube scheint eine Illusion
Ursprung hat den Sinn verloren
Bleiben ist Nirgendwo
Momente tragen mich davon
Was bleibt?

Diesseits erwache ich
Natur haucht ihren Geist in mich 
Standhaft verweile ich
Im eigenen Leibe wandle ich
 
Stetig wachse ich
Der Pfad des Daseins bindet mich
Allhier ende ich
So Wahrheit, erkenne mich 

Glaube scheint eine Illusion
Ursprung hat den Sinn verloren
Bleiben ist Nirgendwo
Momente tragen mich davon
Was bleibt?(Instrumental)Old God's Awake
Fire's Burning Again In The Night
Holy War Has Begun
Ancient War Cry Again, Calls Us To Fight

Old God's Awake
Swords again drink blood
True Belief Returns
Great Forces Return To Our WorldThe semblance of warriors at dawn light 
cold breath drifts through autumn trees 
in the cold shadow of Carpathia 
the wolf cries alone to the night.... 

Sounding of the battle horns 
valleys rich in the cold mourning cadence 
parent earth specter to millennia past 
sorrow in absurdity 

To breath... 

.....thy enemy's hate 

To feel,,,,,, 

..........thy comfort in fear 

yet death is not privilege to any man 

surrender to not but the mountains 
for thy battles serve only the ferry man of styx 

seeking solitude in isolation 
escape to the forest.... 

Deserter destitute yet hell claims no remittance 
soul to search the forest realm 

Grace light mine path... 
through dark oaks I walk for eternity 
forgotten unto the world 
in earth and oaks cradle eternal 

mine splendor, I curse the false of valor 
vale of hate deceives mine senses 
give not thy spirit to tongue of silver 
destitute to lands unknown 

Through rocks and mist I climb 
these roots uncertain to hold 
specter of life within a covered dream 
I scale the ancient fells... 

In the passage of oaks, under silver sky 
Carpathian moonrise 
sword in hand, single eye 
let Odin's hand be mine guide 

Wandering the fell land 
home of groundless spirits 
children of battle, eternal in the etherFlaaet fra skaebnen min
Fjernet i doedsoejeblikket
Et nyfoedt barn jeg var blot
Da de mig i mosen fandt

Nattens yngel bar spaed
Svoebt i menneskehud
Gennem sti og krat
Til runesten, til blot

Kvad synges til min sjael
Varnt blod overhaeldes krop
Som slaegt de var
Til fjende de blev, de viste ansigt
Deres pinsler, elendigheden
Sindssyg fra barnsben, forseglet skaebne

Jeg blev ondskabt
Tvunget til vanviddets natlige dans
Drevet af deres hunger til blod

I sind runger kvad:
"Hver nat soeg offer
Vor sult at ende
Intet flaesk
Du er vor munds gaest
Intet mod
Straffen betales med eget blod"

Verset gentog sig i vinden
Vendt tilbage uden min byrde...Soaring high above 
Feathers shine like black gold 
On this twilight hour 
O' watcher of ages 
That are now long gone by 
Unaltered By time 
The bearer of secrets 
Of whispering old forests 
Shrouded by myths 
Now solemny rise 
On your wings and carry 
My song to Valhalla 

On the throne of wood and leaf 
The wisest of your kind 
Messengers of one eyed god 
Two silhouettes in the sky 

Soaring high above 
Feathers shine like black gold 
On this thilight hour 
You herald the coming end 
For the worn out and dying 
Beneath the firmamentcleansed by hate
the only son of hell walks among us
omega of his slandering existence
his oligophrenic ghost image bleeding at his feet
time for an unholy vendetta

death is the great leveller
extirpator, vigilante, hunter

shrieked by the attack
time for vendetta
till death maims

shrieked by the swift attack
thousands perish
in mere seconds
a thin layer of shattered bones and gore
the ashes are spread among the victims like a grey veil

cleansed by hate
the only begotten son of Hell
omega of His slandering existence
his oligophrenic ghost image bleeding at his feet
death is the great leveller
intrepid follower of the path

he is the dead man
walking among the living
he is the dead man
intrepid follower of the left hand path
he is the dead man
walking among the opribious living
intrepid follower of the left pathWwent be with neither chariot
Nor companion at his aid
Dressed as a young boy, to seek revenge
For the treachery he had faced
In the hall of many deceits
Now at daybreak he goes to sea

"Such a lad cannot bear
The cold and reach of my journeys
You speak with confidence and now
We soon will see whether tongue holds truth
And the ox you use as bait
Will lure the senses of the deep..."

It can be said in truth that Thor had tricked both Giant and Serpent, no less than he had been deceived himself.

Though the serpent took the bait
His fate was prolonged
Revenge was swift and the hammer was thrown 
Now lain in the deepTorment raging through my veins
While the sun is shining - I decay
You will die by my teeth, for I am your reaper
In eternal night, in eternal winter

Suffer and die, I'm the return of your death
You thought you could escape
Eternal winter freezes your breath!

Demons...calling your name
They want to tear your soul away
Into your eyes I stab a splinter
See the eternal night, the eternal winter

In Siberia I live on my own
In a hut which is built of your bones
In search of my wife, where can I find her
In eternal night, in eternal winter

You wear guilt of her death
Jesus Christ - that's one reason why I hate you
Fall from grace - my son will kill your father
In eternal night, in eternal winter

Eternal Winter!(Instrumental)At the dead of the night when the moon shines so bright
And the rowan trees're alright in the dark
When they come close to me then I breathe easily
Hit the light is around

Now we know where we are going
Kind of seeds we have to sow in
When you are ready then call me
To let turn alive Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood

Let me tell you the truth of the one lied to you
Realize break it through again and again
Turn around and you'll see what it's all has to be
The revival is near

Now we know where we are going
Kind of seeds we have to sow in
When you are ready then call me
To let turn alive Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood

We are Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood(Instrumental)(Instrumental)In the direction that the wind travels
The old funeral trees dance
Oracle of all power 
She of the golden bosom that never forgets 
Bestowing fire on the ritual herbs
Burning seed of visionary wisdom 
Make of the tomb of the forest a secret

And we will be tributaries with our hymn 
And we will be tributaries with the bread of the dead 
With our silent mourning 
With the nectar of sacrifice 

Oracle of all power
Lead us without pain to the grey gathering 
Guide our steps to the cold inner temple 
Make us trees that seek out the sun..(Instrumental)There's no glory in weakness
No honour in submission
You must avenge the offense
By legitimate violence

In the gleam of the torches's fires
Are taking form the threatening shadows
Choose the denial of the temples of liars
Choose the denial of the preachers of lies

Take the way of will and pride
The way of self government
No glory for weak needles
Leave mankind, follow bestiality

Embrace freedom- cult of might!
You must be an animal
Nothing in common with human pests
Forget the putrid mankind plague
Give back her purity to the earth

A glittering glare in their eyes
Draped in the gloomy breath of night
Dripping with the chaostar's light
In the glade appear the glazed glistening knights

Don't care about compassion
War beasts of mother earth
Throw human considerations
Wild beasts, might and predation

Embrace freedom- cult of might!(Instrumental)Dark dimensions
Black breed of fire
Slayer of words
Taker of visions
Guardian of eternal power
Eternal... power !

I know the black entity behind the voice
The dark energy
The core of life and death
It is all and it is nothing
The black form of all forms
Let the viper arise !!!

Cosmic forces
Total blackness
Chaos and darkness surround me
Flickering black energy
Of the four elements
Of dark nature
Chant forth damnation !
Hear the call from above !

Behold the secrets of shadowdancer...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)since more than onethousand years
surrounded by majestic peaks,
built at giant rocks,
the old walls of the frightening fortress are standing

many dark princes reigned
at our mighty castle in the forest
thousands of brave warriors died at it`s rampart
and drenched the mountains with their blood

hundreds of battles the knights stroke,
desperate fights for power and immortality
in union with dark forces
the magnificient building got unconquerable

our mighty castle, since more than onethousand years
a sign for war, death and ruin - unbendable
against the hated enemy
it got the symbol for destruction

just today we`re standing at our majestic fortress
icy northwind is blowing through the abyssed walls
and we are looking
into the white snowcovered country

steamed through by this cold night
we feel the anger of the warriors
and hear the battlesound of swords and axes,
out of times long ago in the halls of our fortressSnow
An ashes from the flame of northern hearts
Wind
The blackest wings of hate
Frozen tears of the forsaken
Wind, Black Wind
Forthcoming Joy of Vengeance
Wrathful breath of Nord
Burns my flesh
Yet I am glad, as our time is coming
Yes. It's coming, no one could stop it,
As winter arrives again
Snow
An ashes from the flame of northern hearts
Wind
The blackest wings of hate
Snow, snow
Frozen tears of the forsaken
Wind, Black Wind
Storming Joy of Vengeance
Leaden heaviness of the skies...
I hold them with the only finger
Are we winning this war? We've already won!
As winter arrives again.Balius and Xanthus - From the burning wind
A mighty force eternal - Breathing flame on battlefields
On so high in battle overlord Achilles stands
Directs the war commands

Ride the winged harpy - Stear the beast into the fray
Drown the world in slaughter on this sacred bloody day
Trampled under hoof - Now grind him down the enemy
For all the gods to see - Yeah

Immortal chariot - Immortal chariot
Riding high - Across the sky
Riding high - Forever

From above he viewed the blaze of the rising flames
He saw our vessels burn - And he saw the death and pain
Dressed in armor of the Gods - Proud he bears his shield
his mighty spear to wield

Upon his head the helmet - his sword is claiming death
Ruler of the battlefield - On these fields of dread
Here the death of heroes of all legends may await
But victory's his fate - Yeah

Immortal chariot - Immortal chariot
Riding high - Across the sky
Riding high - Forevermore

Immortal chariot - In strength and grace
Immortal breed - Like wind in speedWish for war caused the death of many men
But they died with pride and honour...
Now Walhalla is their land to defend...
until they will forget about the "end".
Sound of thousands voices call us to the war
The war for our lands, the war for our souls
The blood of Odhin is running through our veins
The victory is ours remaindeed in the tales
Hail to Walkirie, mother of the brave
Hail to Thor keeper of our souls
Hail to the warriors before us
Hail to us all...
The honour to die in battle shades our fear
and give us strength before we meet our brothers
We`ll fight together the great Battle
The dawn of victory is near...
Chorus: Wish for war, hail...Land of the thousand lakes
Land of the beautiful sights
(every part of you is so different, always new and fresh)

Many enemies have tried to submit thy powers
Under their will but always you have hold your ground

O, (mighty) Fennia
Land of the greatest powers that can be wielded
The mighty shamans and brave warriors are
Standing by your side

Thought times and dust our ancestors have
Always shed their blood when needed for fatherland

People of north
People of sisu
(and the holy sauna)On these times bestowed
Hundredth plea and thousandth curse
Barren rain laces smote
Weeping salt on conquered earth

What lies in wait
What lies in bane
Void begets faith
What kilns remain
In quiet hearth
Land unnamed
That name is hate

What flesh can house truths unsaid
Shackled fiends, gilded lies, furnace words

Wail and howl for shallowest breath
Then tear the heretic heart,
Breastwork with pious thirst; unquenched

On these times bestowed
Names worn shadow thin
Whispered words iron stoke
Shame cast to very skin(Instrumental)Chosen by the gods of old, the thirteenth and last to ride. Journey to the northland as we push against the tides. Quest to be answered, brave and honorable shall ride. To meet the king that the demons of fire defied. Frost of frozen blades, mists of broken weather. Thunder of the shields, awaiting the halls of Valhalla. Arriving on the shores of the beast itself, the dark grimness of the landscape grips my soul. Warriors of honor we unite, with our swords in hand to fight. For honor and the unity of our land. Swords of true steel, old battle wounds never really heal. But to live for honor is to take our last breath. As the smoke of battle clears, scenery soaked in blood. We look to the horizon, we look as the raven flies. The shadow of the mountain, spreads far and wide. Remember fallen warriors as we march where evil lies.Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds, oh lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor
Yeah!

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes
Yeah!

(Bridge)

Now in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs of the power
Hand of God has sturck the hour
Day of judgement, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing, spreads his wings
OH LORD YEAH!So grey and sad 
My life is just a morbid shadow 
Just the opposite I wished it would be 

So bitter and bad 
My eyes are veiled by a densy mist 
The river of joy has ceased to exist 

My words get weak 
And I bleed 
Tear for tear 
I am bleeding more 
I am bleeding more 
Will I have to bleed forevermore? 
More and more 

My heart is empty 
My days just are grey 
Temptation showed my way 

I lost my control 
I have lost my way 
And I will run away for you to stay 

So grey and sad 
A glimpse of hope was crushed long before 
Just the opposite I wished it would be 

So bitter and bad 
Thoughts are only black and white 
Infected by an unwinnable fight 

In these moments 
I need neverending silence 
In every of these moments 
My heart felt the pain 

In these moments 
My heart is bleeding tear for tear 
In every of these moments 
I'm tired of facing my life 

I am bleeding more 
I am bleeding more 
Will I have to bleed forevermore? 
More and moreThe wait is soon at end
Always charge never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!

Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!

Forces of chaos are on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die

The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
and Surtur spreads his fire

All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

Total war is here, face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains - Ragnarok is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!Black hopes full of pleasure

and a congratulation
happy nights, happy pain
happy and perversion.U leer de wegen zijn bitter,
gedoemd tot een leven van ellende en haat
In het kille staal ons enige vertrouwen,
de sleutel in strijd naar Walhalla

Voorvaders geesten berijden de winden,
in het duister hoort men hun eeuwig lied
Gezworen eden en levenscodes,
door het Christelijk gif gedaan teniet!

Wodans zonen ontwaak gij sluimerend volk, want de vlammen reiken naar de hemel!
De marmeren poorten, de schoot waaruit de ware duisternis ontsprong!

Christus de herder leed de kuddes van God door de mist naar het dal van onwetendheid
Ver weg verwijdert van de ware magie van hun God nu gedoemd tot soberheid
Menig onze broeders verwierpen hun god en knielden voor Judea's Christendom,
allerheilige plaatsen werden verwoest en gezegend door vervloekte kerken...


Draugluin '99Solitude
When does the loneliness end?
I am awaiting death in darkness for I'm alone.
In Solitude I want my life's end.

Where are you my wife to see my blood running out of me?
Where are you to feel my final breath?
Feel my love and hate me now for I am just pain for you.
Hate me and cover me with death.

I would rather be with you, be an father to my son.
The same black blood does run in our veins.

Liebe und Glaube und Hoffnung und Dunkelheit.
Luzifer, oh bringe mir dein Licht!
Mich friert, ich bin einsam, sehne mich nach meinem Weib.
Tod, warum ereilst du mich denn nicht?Above black mountains,
Beyond the lands of snow.
Across raging seas,
Another journey toward the end begin.
Through the time, through the fear!

Fight! Sword in hand!
Surrounded by fear in the end!
Courage! Honor!
Glorious path to Val!
Fight! Sword in hand!
Obeying to the king 'til the end!
Carnage! horror!
Bloody path to Kraal!

Arrows in the sky.
Falling by deadly waves.
A glow in the eyes.
Bloody red fire flows in their veins.
And now! Through the fight! Winning over fear!

Fight! Sword in hand!
Surrounded by fear in the end!
Courage! Honor!
Glorious path to Val!

CALL OF THE ANCIENT ANCESTOR (INTRO)

LISTEN NOW MY PEOPLE..
I AM CONTACTING YOU FROM HUNDRED OF YEARS AGO..
I HAVE SEEN THE DISASTER OF THE PRESENT YEAR..
TO WHICH HAPPENED TO OUR BELOVED HOMELAND..

SUCH A SORROWFUL TORMENT I HAVE SEEN,
OUR LAND IS NO LONGER OURS!
STAND UP BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
SHARPEN BACK OUR ANCIENT SUNDANG (SWORD),
MARCH TO THE FRONT AND RECLAIM OUR ANCESTRAL LAND!

DON'T LET OUR MOTHER CRY IN AGONY..
RECLAIM BACK OUR ANCESTRAL LAND!When twilight gives way to warming beams of the upcoming dawn 
I hover with freedom 
Over open surfaces of lakes 
With coming of early evening when sun lies down into mountain clefts, 
In moonshine I am coming back in the form of hawk, 
Rushing headlong where forests border the horizon. 
Dark hostile lands, where wild animals rule, are my home. 
Where roaring waterfalls rush down rocky cliffs, 
Wild unbridled water ruins banks, 
Furrows its way through slopes and aims down, south. 
Where storms do not end 
At time of winter kingdom's frost, 
Where bunches of mist are gathering 
And fade away again 
When pure pale morning illuminates white plaines with hoarfrost, 
Where time stays unmoving 
To be formed by moments of changes. 
There I live in inseparable bonds of appurtenance.We are all born with the scar on the soul,
Behind us the abyss, and in fron the wall.
Do we have strength for the honest life,
Everything is broken and time is passing by.

Well we can all that was honour in the first place,
To fight and pull through these difficult days.
Our only hope is battle agains third world,
With Polish and Serbian slavic swords.

United slavic tribes with united swords
In the common battle for the 14 words.

Join us brothers to create the possibility
Forget the fear and see the hidden reality.
Stepping bravely in the fight to the death
Is the only solution for the salvation of our land.

We once had everything under control
With Polish and Serbian slavic swords.
United slavic tribes with united swords
In the common battle for the 14 words.(Instrumental)Regret you sinners
Pay indulgences to
Fend Lucifer when he
Whets his trident for you

Up to the pyre
Your excuses are a mess
Witchery is proven
Your heart full of blackness

Die, you heathens!
Or convert to the Lord
Agony you'll feel of the
Most horrible sort

Carnal desires
Are vicious and false
Pray and work until
Your own funerals

Refrain:
"Dance, god chosen people
To our bidding your whole life
And as long as you twist
We sow the strife

Words of venom
Words of sanctimoniousness
Delightful masked corruptness

Determined - supposed to be
Damnation - never free
Betrayed eyes can never see

Determined - supposed to be
Damnation - pray for eternity
You'll never be free"

Deus lo vult believe what we say
Deus lo vult to prevent affray
Deus lo vult hang heretics high
Deus lo vult salvation is nigh

Saddle your horses
Brave crusaders of God
Redemption will befall you
It was the Lord who prod

Devilish science abhorrent lies
Believe in it and we will bruise you like flies

History of creation
Is the absolute
As well as redemption
When you creep as our brute

Believe that you're free
As long as you toe the line
You do the work
And we drink the wine

Refrain(Instrumental)Hagalaz 

Old Hag Of The Frost 
Gaze Down Upon Your Barren Trees And White Earth 

The Badger Curls In Her Belly 
Sipping Slowly 
Her Sweet Black Breath 
Stones Fall From Her Apron: Mountains 

Behold The Withering Light 
Breathe Deep The Sun's Decay 
Dark Mother: Hear Our Call 

Suffer For The Wisdom Of The Hag Of WinterWhites herald wept and drew its final sigh
Shed crimson crest as season begins to bend
Frail bite of embers light, in dying warmth to hide
And pretend... will dawn rise again

Homeward
Pristine paths of north
March pilgrims of sword
No trails left by beast or man
Chaste shining hoarfrost
Seek eyes the paling hearth
Before stars shroud the sun

Garnered light must shine a hundred nights
Through dark torment, in hope of spring nascent
Dreams of blind, dreams of sun, under veiling white
And pretend... will dawn rise again

Northwind
Of shallow bays it sings
Yet freezing hail it brings
With silver deathcold wings
Severes the crust of fjord
Let life of guiding torch
Outlast the fading dawn

Gone, the light withdrawn and skies adorned
Now flecked and torn with black vulture spawn
Like wolves that hunt the swan
They chase the fleeing dawn

So curses whispered end as godless sleep descends 
Will dawn rise againSinn (The Blazing Queen)
Sinn, goddess of the moon, immortal of the immortals 
Supreme queen of darkness, blazing goddess of the moon 

Looking beyond, the endless horizon, where darkness unites with infinity 
Where hate, embraces passion, where fate belongs to me 

"The wind was dark until... then formed the light of the golden crown 
As the blaze shines upon the oar, she wets her body in the water of the ocean" 

The nocturnal eye, is crying, in darkness resounding, his howling 
The trees are singing the calling, for Sinn, the forbidden goddess Sinn... 

"She is dressed with her cloak, which moon-lights the earth 
As she rides her strong horses to the sky 
Hail Sinn! Hail the goddess! Hail blazing queen!" 

The howling of wolves, the winter in my soul, whispers of snakes sting my mind 
My passion for you is still alive, Oh! your passion...screams of pain 

Sinn, goddess of the moon, immortal of the immortals 
Supreme queen of darkness, hear my death-call 

Mother of blasphemy, mother of unholy creatures 
Let me offer you my soul in your deep-black arms 

Coming to my embrace...Blood red sun is rising
A crown of clouds below
The beams of sunlight waking
Hearts of stone and snow
Eyes so filled with darkness
Hopeless were before
They tend to watch the sunrise
Depths of strength beyond

Arise...

The giant old mountain
It sees all rivers flow
It speaks of promise we've made
100 years ago
Faith once lost in ruins
Glimmer through the stones
Ascension of old spirits
Our kingdom arise strong

Arise...

Hidden within us all
Sorrow grows more and more
The will of freedom calls
We must take this last road
Arise

The morning of the newborn day
Maybe it's our last
It feels like all these storms awake
To tear us from our past
The bleeding of the dawn today
So beautiful and fast
The sun's awared of our death
Our bones will turn to dust

Arise...

Hidden within us all
Sorrow grows more and more
The will of freedom calls
We must take this last road
Arise

Amidst the heights
We'll surely die
The old mountain cries
One last goodbye(Instrumental)War is closed by us
Warriors die nearby
They defend their lands
From those who trespassed
Take your sword and bow and arrows
Saddle a horse, put on a hauberk

Forward! To the war to defend the land
Where you live
Where you grew up
Where you sing your songs

In bloody battle only spirit survive
Body will decay forever
Forever!

Demolish your sword
Send your arrows to foes
Make them run away
From the land where fathers lived
This is a reason to die without fear
Fight to the better end, you can't give up
Redden you sword with enemy blood
Don't spare yourself
Don't lose your heart
Don't lose your pure mind

In bloody battle only spirit survive
Body will decay forever
Forever!

Warriors are fighting and
Forefathers aren't ashamed
Your cause is just cause
Don't fear to die for it
Maybe you will never come back
Your bones will be pull apart
The corpse will vanish, but spirit will stay
For you offspring
To help them in life
In life with proudly raised head.(Instrumental)Feelings I hide from you
As I reach you my hand
The stain of guilt sticks in my head
This perception I cannot longer stand

Aware of all mistakes I made
Hoping for rainy clouds to fade
As I slowly die
Here inside my mind

I still see your dark reflection on the walls as winter falls
A glimpse of the moment, a touch in the dark
The warmth I still recall

From this day, I vow
Far too long I tried
Hoping for forgiveness of the heart
You're waiting
She decided to come back, she decided to stay for a while
Hoping for the change that could never happen
The change of the soul and the mind
Please return...


Feel like I'm falling away from you, this time...

And as I recall my downwards fall, it fills me with anger and hate
As I realise I lost you that time, and now it's far too lateIt's the end of the year nine hundred ninety nine
For nobles and countrymen, peasants and lords
The edge of oblivion draws near

Medieval darkness, cradle of magic
On through the night, the fears are growing
No more tomorrow, a merciless ending
Nowhere to run, the time is coming
The time is coming!

In the name of the Lord
The Pope and the Bishops preach
The beast of damnation will rise from the sea
The serpent of hell devours

Sinners are chanting, pay for salvation
You'd better prepare when judgement calls you
Is it too late now? Omens are clear
End of the world, the Finis Mundi
The Finis Mundi!

God, hear the call of the sons of the Earth
We will stand tall in this time of despair
Prophecies old from the dawn of all days
Only the pure will survive this dark age

This is the end of all times, it's the Finis Mundi
Damned are the souls left behind, it's the Finis Mundi
Angels descend from the sky, it's the Finis Mundi
Watching the world as it dies, it's the Finis Mundi(Instrumental)The next important battle we had won
But to many of the clan could flee
Uziel is back in his headquarter
He will call his soldiers to defend us
I can't mourn for my dead son
And now we should fight again
This time is to less for me
But I demand the revenge
I will send some messengers
To the towns Ashwood and Ruhn
They have to tell our allies
That we meet us in 7 days

[Chorus:]
Strong we stand together
We know the next days are crucial
Nobody knows what the morning will bring
Or if he is still alive
This is our Revenge
We have to go our way
This is our destiny
The darkest time in our life

I hope the messengers will arrive soon
I don't have enough soldiers and men
We need more swords and spears
To have a chance to win
Now today it is time for us
Our hard journey will start today
I can see the fear in the faces
Of my friends my soldiers my heart

[Bridge:]
Death and pain will pave my way
Blood and flesh on broken bones
Agony and mourn are in my heart
This is the only reason why I have to fight

[Chorus:]
Strong we stand together
We know the next days are crucial
Nobody knows what the morning will bring
Or if he is still alive
This is our Revenge
We have to go our way
This is our destiny
The darkest time in our lifeKELTOY WARRIORS

WARGleich Gespenstern furchteinfloessend scheissen sie durch's Dunkel
mit Blitz und mit Donner, auf den Schwingen der Nacht
sie sind das Wueten in den Wolken, der Sturm am Firmament
Wotans wildes Heer gehuellt in Totentracht.

Unter'm Vollmondlichte sammelt sich das wilde Heer
hernieder zu stuermen aus des Firmaments Wolkenpracht
sie sind das Brausen des Sturmwindes, sind Blitz und Donnersgrollen
das Heer der levenden Toten in geheilg'ter Fulmondnacht.

Sie sind das Brausen des Sturmwindes, sind Blitz und Donnersgrollen

Musik: Widar (Brachet 2.002)
Text: Widar (Ostermond - Heuert 2.002)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The Tragedy of Macbeth
(music by Rhaa, Herr Doktor and Nathuruss, lyrics by W.Shakespeare, Rhaa)

MACDUFF: Not in the legions of horrid Hell can come a devil,
more damned in evils to top Macbeth.
HECAT: Spiteful and wrathful, who (as others do)
loves for his own ends, not for you,
But make amends now, get you gone and at the pit of Acheron,
Meet me i'th'morning, thither he will come to know his destiny...
MACBETH: For in my way it lies, stars hide your fires,
Let not light see my black and deep desires, 
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be, 
What the eye fears, when it's done to see...

I... you? Just a slave of the sea.
Drown... seek down, let it be
I... nothing stayed from you
Alone... poor man, what will you do?

HECAT: Your vessels and your spells provide,
your charms and everything beside,
I'm for th'air: this night I'll spend
unto a dismal and fatal end
and that distill'd by magic sleights
shall raise such artificial sprites,
as by the strenght of their illusion
shall draw him onto his confusion
HECAT: He shall spurn fate, scorn death and bear his hopes
'bove wisdom, grace and fear...

Drifting with the stream of a well-known sea
fighting with an element of life,
let drift, oh, Macbeth, don't you hear sounds
from the depths of desire,
Discover the ruin of the ancient empire,
Atlantis - Platopolis for you,
A bank will bring you just another fight,
diviner of reality lies...

Why?... 'cause your fight has no sense,
Down... There's you in the coral depths,
I... an undine'll help you to find your right streams
Doubt... so you'll never find your Atlantis

LADY MACBETH: Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts,
unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the top-full of direst cruelty:
make thick my blood, stop up th'access and passage to remorse,
that no compunctious visiting of nature, shake my fell purpose
nor keep peace between th'effect and it.
LENNOX: The night has been unruly where we lay;
Our chimneys were blown down and (as they say) lamentings heard i'th'air,
strange screams of death.
And prophesying with accents terrible - of dire combustion and confus'd events
new hatch'd to th'woeful time
LADY MACBETH: Come to my woman's breasts and take my milk for gall
you murth'ring ministers, wherever in your sightless substances,
you wait on nature's mischief.
Come, thick night and pull thee in the dunnest smoke of hell.
LENNOX: The obscure bird clamour'd the livelong light
Some say the earth was feverous and did shake.The vulturous to shape the contours of the earth
A foaming armful therefore washing through the carst
Wonder if you could fill the hole that gapes in me
And flatten thorns that grew...

A strange routine to lay, yells to the rushing steams
Yeaning to pare all my rims
My self-control bequearth, leave the sense behind
Wrapped in my veil of untime...

I wish you were carver
And stroke the only tool
Eternity to shape the cyclone keen...
And all the tiring labour
The vanity of fool
To try and to unveil the libertime...

I've learned to understand the whispers of her mouth
Could stand the goose-flesh that her touch was giving me
Was screaming naked reaching out when passing rocks
She flattened me from world...

Whirling streams, my hair littered with the scees
Seething with my constancy
Wherefore to love the chains, the black of the deep
Adoring her dead-cold embrace

A strange routine to lay, yells to the rushing steams
Yeaning to pare all my rims
My self-control bequearth, leave the sense behind
Wrapped in my veil of untime...Lord of the night and lord of war
bring me back the call of rage

In the battle my law
is to grant your fall
and take my throne again
 
our glory has come
of war
in war
by the enemies down in the earth

and my spirit will fly
like a dragon in the sky
our march will not be vain
 
My army is strong
and the battle is around
by the glorification of the evil
 
and the evil will take you
in this rise of nation
I'll put down them all

In the fight, you will need
Force
and Honor
cause the enemies wants your death
 
and this death won't take place
until the end of this war
because we will fight again

Chorus:
Oh my troop listen my voice
the battle is cursed and our home is so far
Fight today for another day
Our Victory is coming, Resist till the end!
 
Hails! Hails! Hails!
my armor is my pagan pride

Hails! Hails! Hails!
and my sword never will fallHymn:
Over the woods and over the heaths
Over the coasts and over the fields
Through olden oak and stone so cold
Through forestland grown and landscapes so old
On paths in woods to unlit heaths
Grim trampled path to the realm of the dead
In elder me...

The Spirit of Death:
Close your eyes and feel the power
of Infinity
Darkness in all veins and around
Of creation and destruction
Lightness realms
Everlasting  ice cold darkness
I hope I will see the time
When all light will fall
I am born out of dirt and depression
The energy of chaos and time

Rage rage,
oh everlasting yearning for wrath
When will you finally come?
Hate hate,
be my path to my destiny's door.
Dark evil energy
Glorious blackspiritual father...

I call upon the ultimate forces
and powers of death
Spirits be my witness(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Welcome to the Eternal Inn
Wher all the ages of times have been
Warriors sleep, farmers have drinks
And everyone just come to sin
After the fight, after you've done
Finally enjoy a mug of mead
We know you have slaved yourself
Just for a time of mead and meat

And we all know why you have come
Masters and slaves came for the same

Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for mead and a warm plate of meat
Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for the pagan hordes united

So hang your coat, leave your boots outside
Join us and dance all around the place
We are the hordes from the all times
Just be our brother and enjoy the fire
You know as well what really mind
Violins and flutes are about to speak
Bare feet dancing with the pagan tunes
We are the pagan hordes united

And we all know why you have come
Masters and slaves came for the same

Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for mead and a warm plate of meat
Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for the pagan hordes united

Across far rough seas
Escaping from some and other's claws
After so many cannon shots and bleeding
Finally fire has light the sea waters

And I'm now about to sing some songs
Borned from daily life misery
And in front of misfortune can't close the eyes
And as we didn't close the eyes the hells we met

If the liquor I've got in this pitcher
strengthens me enough
As it's not so easy in these oversea lands
In pretty teats to place
these rough and dirty hands
In sweet breast to place
these rough and dirty hands

In my humble euskera (Basque language)
and a more humble melody I'll try
To relate a little story the best way i can
And since nobody knows how long
one will stay in this life

What a joy when placing
these rough and dirty hands in sweet breast
If the liquor I've got in this pitcher
strengthen me enough
I'll try in my humble euskera
this story to vivify(Instrumental)At my command Unleash storms of Hell Unsheathe your swords
Winds of War Harness the Steeds And hail the Gods of War
Raise proud the flag And ride glorious to Eternal Triumph!
A last scarlet blaze Fills up the region
And spreads out itself Like a crown of blood
Upon the peaks sprinkled of snow
Stars men calls eternal change and grow pale
Races and Empires raise and fall like waves
The same is for stars in their eons
While we see from above
Far down life is born upon invisible planets.
Tribes join nations, melting in Empires,
Fall down in war and life dies in millions
Of dying worlds.(Instrumental)GAZE AT THE SKY

YOU WHO SAW HOW OUR ANCESTORS FOUGHT FOR THEIR LANDS,
FAITHFUL WITNESS OF BATTLES FULL OF HONOUR.
YOU WHO SAW HOW OUR PARENTS DIED FOR THEIR BELIEVES,
AND HOW OPPRESSION TOOK FORM.

YOU WILL NOW SEE THE NEW PAGAN DAWN,
THE NEW DAWN OF OUR LAND.

FOUNTAIN OF LIFE, YOU WHO EMBRACE IBERIA.
YOU WHO FERTILIZE OUR MOTHER EARTH WITH YOUR HAIR.
YOU SAW THE CRUEL HISTORY OF OUR RACE,
THE VAIN ATTEMPT OF DESTROYING OUR BLOOD.

THE WOLF CRIES YOUR ABSENCE,
AS YOUR HUNDRED BROTHERS WATCH US FROM ABOVE.

BRAVE WARRIOR, GAZE AT THE SKY,
AND OFFER YOUR WEAPONS TO HIS BLINDING BRILLIANCE.

FOREVER ETERNAL RAY OF LIGHT.
NEVER STOPPED, ALWAYS MOVING(Instrumental)(Instrumental)In the silence of forgotten lands
Between the realms of the past
Riding in the valley of death
Rising into twilight dawn

The battle rages in the hill
When the day of black blood
Warriors of immortal pride
Fighting for their lands

Bridge:
Eternal days of glory
In our time of legends
Eternal days of glory
In our times

And we crossed the vast fields
That filled in our hearts
In the south covered of frost
In the ages of change

We raise the swords
With power and honor
In name of the gods
Walking under the cold

We are pagan! To rescue our pride
We are pagan! We will unite
We are pagan! My brothers don't die
We are pagan! We live in the south

We fall and we rise
Children of the dark sky
Once upon in time

We are immortal spirits
The knights without fear
We die for the world
In these times of crusades

ChorusThere was a night - the only night that was real 
Felt like i'm the chosen one 
But there was no thunder, there was no lightning 
So I thought I were dreaming on 

Straight on through the gates of heaven 
Evil will destroy the souls 
Where's your saviour, where hides Jesus 
Why isn't he at war against us 

Darkness around us was so sizeable 
Black blood running through my veins 
We know: what we did was unacceptable 
But our hearts were by evil love chainedWhen night falls
She cloaks the world
In impenetrable darkness
A chill rises from the soil
And contaminates the air
Suddenly...
Life has new meaning

When night falls
She cloaks the world
In impenetrable darkness
A chill rises from the soil
And contaminates the air
Suddenly...
Life has new meaningIs this just a myth? Consciousness exists

Af ligaskeJOURNEY THROUGH A DARK MIST 


A dark mist covers the moonlight, 
As so, it blinds our view, 
But we keep struggling to break through, 
And unveil the path of darkness. 

Unholy and pagan chants we hear, 
Screams and laments follows us, 
Hate and repulse hit us, 
No matter what, we stand in our feet, 
And keep fighting against it. 

Darkness fills our path, 
Mist blinds us, 
Screams deafen us, 
Hate tries to slay us, 
But all of that make us stronger and stronger. 

The throne, with the horned one awaits us, 
The dark embrace is near, 
Thy power of darkness guides us, 
So many secrets are there for us to unveil. 

We'll be on guard to raise our swords, 
Raise them against those who stole our pure lands, 
Raise them against the false prophet that corrupted our world, 
We'll raise them when we defeat the rotten god and his inferiors, 
Only our journey will end, 
And when our journey ends, we'll sing the pagan chant of victory.(Instrumental)Unleash the powers
Powers of destruction
Hatred within us
The darkest obsession
Gods of the sea
Gave us the mind
Gods of warm now let us win

A new day is born wake up sons
And daughters
United by the gods, we sail the
Violent waters
They gave us a sign
A man on a cross
Supposed to save us all, but
Their minds are forever lost

Take me home
Back to north

The old man whispers, no
Bitterness in his face
He is not afraid of death
He'll come to a better place
As the boat is burning
In this foreign land
No one can tell when I can
Take my mothers hand

We all wanna go home
Many months at sea
Only the strong survive
Feels like an eternity
Our pockets are full of gold

Home to the land of ice
Our eyes are filled with glory
The land we wish to end out lives

Take me home
Back to north

A new day is born, wake up sons
And daughters
United by the gods, we sail the
Violent waters
Gods of the dea
Gave us the wind
Gods of war, now let us win

The hammer smashing the sky
Lightning is his pride
The creator of thunder
He will never die
The wind is blowing for us
At least we're going home
This journey won't be
Forgotten
Shall be written on
A sacred stone

Take me home

We chose to go our seperate ways
It all seemed right and justified
But the sickened feelings were growing inside of me

A years flew by and things were growing dim
Two unseperate souls each went their way in sin
Nothing more to discover
The passion's gone but the guilt still remains

I know this gesture wasn't meant to be
some unhealed scars between you and me ... I'm losing you
When the pain emerges and strikes my heart
and the longing for your touch carves in my mind... 
I'm begging you

And as pain strikes my heart
And the longing for your touch still stands
I know this wasn't meant to be
As nothing's more destructive
Nothing's more relentless
As the bond between you and me(Instrumental)Lyric by Igniis Inferniis

The troops of darkness again
They would rise in fires
With their black horses, cursed the skies
Immortal horsemen defending their souls
Old souls of destruction

In times when the cold guide me
An enormous thunder
Announced the return of the storms
The troops of darkness again
They would rise in fires
With their black horses, cursed the skies
And sanctified with all the pagan hate
Marching triumphant with their swords
On the way to a glorious destiny

Wrought steel warriors of honor and power
Immortal horsemen defending their souls

Old souls of destruction
Marching and looking for the pagan supremacy

Walking between valleys and mountains
I hear echoes of last battles
I see blood and glory in the swords
I feel the euphoria of our ancestral ones

I live in freedom
In this kingdom of old spirits
And hug the bad beauty
Of the most obscure instincts

Therefore the final confrontation will be announced
Therefore the retaliation will be announced
An then we will struggle together
And the pagan fire will prevail foreverLeave alle the goods things
I can, now know where it end
See in my eyes all the pain and hatred
Leave me what I am
And not was I was
I sadly removed
All my inner scars
And all the real ones
Are visible and real
I'm not the one who used to find
I'm not the one who used to love
it's funny to say that I'm full
And that make me be
Wrongly man
Who will know pain and hatred within me
So run away, far from my fucking self
It's time to search, leave your memories behind
My life ways, I choose to be what I am
And I choose to be alone

Leave alle the goods things
I can, now know where it end
See in my eyes all the pain and hatred
Leave me what I am
And not was I was
I sadly removed
All my inner scars
And all the real ones
Are visible and real

I'm not the one who used to find
I'm not the one who used to love
it's funny to say that I'm full
And that make me be
Wrongly man
Who will know pain and hatred within me
So run away, far from my fucking self
It's time to search

Leave your memories behind
My life ways, I choose to be what I am
And I choose to be alone

I used to be 
Real one
Rise up 
Alone
Lost

I am not...anymore
I am not...anymore
In the sky 
And in light(Instrumental)to declare oneself a hurried embark of one stray lamb:
and one and two and three and twenty of such abhorred
things describing such an acrid reality.
in this way i have become the antium.
in this way i have fabricated an establishment
beyond standards set by jura, his own mount.
a mount of such lewd acts.
indecency committed by a praetor:
how inconceivable.A bloody night and a cold dawn,
Horns are blowing, I hear the call
Broken shields in a red day
Sons of Odin are here to stay

Ride, swords in the Wind
Viking warriors join me
By the sword we live
Tyr shall lead us to victory

Thor! Smash them all
Enemies and giants fall
As sure as the valkyries fly
For Odin I will die

For Asgard we ride
The gods are on our side
Brothers you can count me in
To die for Odin

Another night, another dawn
Horns are blowing, I hear the call
Broken bones in a red day
Sons of Odin are here to stay

Ride, once again
Viking brothers join me
By the sword we live
Tyr shall lead us to victory

Holding Gungnir
Riding Sleipnir
Lead us to glory

Thor! Smash them all
Enemies and giants fall
As sure as the valkyries fly
For Odin I will die

For Asgard we ride
The gods are on our side
Brothers you can count me in
To die for OdinThrough the oceans of fame
Through the lies of people
We are fulfilling life
Through the mountains of trouble
Through the corroded lands
We go until we die

We have to pay the price of living

So many things we've done
So many things we've changed
Waiting for prodigy
So close we were
And we have attended
The Human glory

Life must end - this is fate
But grave, my friend, you have to waitIn today's chaos
In yersterday's misery and age of many pests
Plenty of people stepped over the gate of the dead.
Flesh rotten from the bodies-feeding
Their blood flooded the fields as red swamp.
A hilld started to grow
Its filthy whiteness shined through the mountains
As it was the biggest among all
...called bonestake...

Victims of lost wars and viruses
Miserables of hunger.'chosen ones' of nature
They built this bonfire
Harder than all fires
That burn down the flesh of man
The shock
That it cannot be erased
Will be only stronger
As the future is evil
Bringing merely deathIn the middle of winter, frost freezed the hearts of many humans,
They hate coma, the warriors of Wotan.
Armed with sword and shield,
they crossed the cold and dark woods,
There swords where thursting for blood,
blood of the enemy.
The time of steel and war had come,
there hearts where burning with flaming heat.
Only their will forced them up from battle to battle,
to victory or death.
They knew no pain,
there was no escaping and no hope.
The fire and cold steel of war dominating the happening.
Darkness and shivering cold enclosed the battlefield.
The enemy was defeated,
and so again the draw there swords,
and followed the Call of the pagan Woods.Antichristian and Pagan

This is the neverending night
Of war and hate
And this night shows all its greatness
to those that walk under the banners of time
That is certain in this revolution
And certain in death below dealing
I am awake I feel my flesh slowly drained of will
I am laying now on this cold battlefield
So far from the sun
And the blackwinds are calling
Calling my spirit to capture the sorrow
of the moon and purity of frost
And to roam this fields
On the wings of december holocaust

We're on a misson that we're destined to fail
Feint, dillusional, misled
On an empty trail

Trying hard, but getting nowhere
A mystical vision, that we're gonna sail
Making our decision, as we clear the trail

We should be going somehwhere
But we don't know where
What we see behind our eyes
Is not what we realise
We're on a voyage to nowhere

Bow down and hear our cry
Our Earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride

Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man
The smile on his lips

The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The eyes of the nile are opening - you'll see

She came to me with a serpents kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the dawn

The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The eyes of the nile are opening - you'll see

Bind all of us together
Ablaze of hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be kind
The watcher in the ring
It is youI burn quiet...
A taste of sound, precaution fierce
A creature 'pon my chest, fuming

She sighs farewell, glancing at me

Either the gates or the breeze
Was that the hooting in the trees?
The timber pine in window and voices there beneath
A dirge, my wailing banshee...riding in darkness

through the hell of the night
give all your torment to the heaven's might
in the name of satan spread all your fear
you feel his anger you know he's near

casting a spell
lord of all hells

baphomet's calling death is now real

your flesh is dot rot

tormentorThere is more day to dawn
The sun is but a morning star(Instrumental)(Instrumental)See a dead body
Feverish fancies
Bout how to remove
Of a humanbeing not important if it is a man, a woman or a little girl
All I want is to feel the slippery dry jell in my handsNeverending
At his neverending
Neverending journey
I have waited for sun to be seen
For the silence cloaked these mountains and peaks
I have been longing for the downing
A break of new day
Sorrows away
A spring on my way
Sad God in forest
Neverending
At his neverending
Neverending journey
I always wondered the seas of solitude
Eternaly I asked questions
And reasoned the meaning
The entity was broken centurys ago
I always search for the sad God in forest
Hear me my Gods
I wonder in dark
I'm bleeding my wounds
From the swords of time
Sad God in forest


We wondered the hills
We scattered the plains
Neverending was the day
Neverending these rains
Unchain my heart free
It promised to pray
Upon Christians as wolves
As the nightfall to day
We drowned in the lakes
We plundered the lands
Neverending was the day
Neverending these rains
Prepare for this dream
It is waiting to rise
In those moments of war
When the races collide
Prepare for the nightfall...The day still seems so faraway
Another battle in the fight
My blood's boiling, nothing to say
Noisy silence in this endless night

Something in my head, growing eternally
Fed by the poison of this timeless whisper
Makes my blood run hard as in agony
And my thoughts grey as winter

Feeling nothing but my toxic veins
Searching for myself another way
My soul's away, as cold as pain
Need to change my merciful fate

This war between me and my soul
Tears away my strength and pain
My skin's hurting, bad tripping
Just want to have some quiet time,

The day still seems so faraway
Another battle in the fight
My blood's boiling, nothing to say
Noisy silence in this endless nightIn isolation upon this Earth
We set conventions determine all she's worth
Making one species the measure of all things
Which breathes decay and death to all it brings
Without an equal our restless spirit dreams
Escape and conquest, transcending other realms
Earth mother's blessings crumble to dust
Sky father's kingdom within our grasp

Reshape the features enhance upgrade
With bloody circuits implanted in our brains
Our nerves electric our limbs mechanical
Steer evolution guided by hands of doom
From fragile vessels imperfect limited
Transfer the essence to everlasting form
Never a shortage food for the mind
For all we gain so much we leave behind

So cold the skin of metallic waste
Our hunger breeds the end of days
Failed design, Framed demise
When we no longer feel and cease to rot we shall fulfill
Destiny, Immortality

As new gods we shall become
Apex of all existence
Reaching out to ageless chaos

So cold the skin of metallic waste
Our hunger breeds the end of days
Failed design, Framed demise
When we no longer feel and cease to rot we shall fulfill
Destiny, ImmortalityWith the last blink of my eyes

Total darkness enshrouds me

Engulfed by an abnormal blackness

Floating into a realm created by myself

I'm flying in this astral state, darkness fades (away)

Feeling free to do whatever I wish to do

Mysterious domain unknown to any other man

This is my place, my nocturnal home, my refuge

Revealing secrets of a distorted mind

Chorus 1:

Obey your own thoughts

Yield to the dream-demons

Anti-reality, another dimension you need to live

To refreshen from daily shit and all these humiliations

Abstract reality, untouchable, so near and yet so far

Never to reach, materialization of subconscious dreads

Chorus 2:

Obey your own thoughts

Bow to the dream-demons

Hidden for a long time, childish fears

Coming out and eating away at me

Appearing of unreal shapes frightens me

Start to strike relentlessly, fierce attack

Chorus 3:

Obey you own thoughts

Surrender to the dream-demons

in the forest of black woods, wolves are howling to the moon...
as the sword against the naked meat, frost penetrates the soul of everyone
from the wilderness came death, my revenge I'll see

winter cold, of ice the sword
as my hateful heart
winter war destructing the life
with my blade of ice

Never fight, the true heathenish force, ultimate wapon of bloody revenge
against them who want to impose the false, for the rebirth of their flaccid god
so these mighty cold hate-winds may erase christianity
destroying the balance of the universe of light, my revenge I'll see

winter cold, of ice the sword
winter freezing soul
winter war destructing the life

Even her books for adolescents are intense
She writes clean-cut and optimistic
But for someone born in 1912
She was totally with it
The Witch World series began Horn Crown
The World of Estcarp put the girls in power
Pressed the point to pontificate how
To keep the technocrats out
I had a hunch you were all woman
Even though you name's Andre
From Victory On Janus all the way to Forerunner Foray
I've read Andre since a child and until my dying day
Bury me with one to read
While I turn to powder in the bottom of my grave
I'll be spinning my bones to powder
In the bottom of my grave

Output continuous(Instrumental)Er Omringt ons een kracht 

Die alle dingen bezielt

Werd je ooit gedreven

Tot zelfrefectie

In bossen bij vuur

Op rotsen in wind

Bij onweer in water

Pravdu skryla t'ma vekov...When I am out in the vast expanses of nature I feel a calm solitude, 
a beautiful separation. 
I am enveloped in and awed by the majesty around me. 
I do not wish for people to think of loneliness or fear, or the emotion "isolation" in a negative sense. 

Just listen to my words: 
Isolation in this sense is a purifying, uplifting sensation. 
Isolated from everything unexciting, 
Isolated from everything ugly and degrading. 
Alone in a beautiful world... 
Absent from a flawed species.Take a new look at God
In the dust it's the wrong way round
Speak the place names and days
Let the honey drip from your tongue
The dew that runs from the before

We're not scared of believing
In the gods of before
Inside us they are breathing
We can wake them all

A wise man knows himself
And a fool knows the rest
Universalism sets our eyes in the sand

I know where the cool blue air
Waits for the children
Just be there, in how you feel
Just be there, await the steel

We're not scared of believing
In the gods of before
In our lands they are breathing
Time to wake them up

In our lore
In our hearts
In our minds

Don't be scared of believing
In the gods of before
In our lives shallow breathing
I and I and us.

I pick up the spear that our
Ancestor has thrown
Clean it of it's darkness
Ignorance and corruption
And throw it on
Newly shined
For another 1500 yearsCome warriors, Praise the Steel! 

Come followers, to the celebration of iron and steel
The brotherhood was forged with the blood and honor of my clan
Come warriors, this is an ode to the supreme metal scream
That's in our battlefields, that was sounding for ages and ages

No one can feel the pleasure that a battle can be to my people,
The swords up in the air prepared to join in the supreme celebration of war
Soon we will listen, the music made by steel.
Sword against shield, axe against armor and the bravery in one strong chorus

"Praise the Steel, my children,
Praise the Steel, proud of my clan,
In the fields of unknown there is only one true
Is in your heart and hands, you must follow it
To secure the existence of the sons of your sons
You, my Children, must Praise the Steel"

Come and listen to the wind, feel the cold and strong sound
The hymn of war louder and louder, the strong tradition
To Praise the SteelPaa den skinnende idavoll

[written by Marc - January 2001]

Part I: Six years of slaughtering

The sixth year of an insane killing spree

Restless spring, wicked deprecation

Boring jobhunting, passionate ravaging

Cruelty exploding into devilish mutilation

Cut off the lips of innocence

Put the organs in their own mouth

Just vengeance for the offence

Severed genitals in the abdominal cavity

Refrain

Stalk the prey, chase the hunter

Make your pray, regret your blunder

Living a perfect double life

Unable to intimacy with his wife

Seeking for peace of mind

Sweet white bones to grind

Part II: Tracked and arrested

Tracked down in a bus station

While engaging women into conversation

Pursuit continued into restaurants, bars

Chronic brain disease leaves scars

Young woman sat down next to him

She laid her head in his lap

Fondling her juvenile breasts

Giving him a wet blow job

Refrain

Stalk the prey, chase the hunter

Make your pray, regret your blunder

Shortly after, he was under arrest

In the man's brown briefcase

A length of rope, a long-bladed knife

Charged with harassment in public place

Learning of his penchant for children

But the blood type didn't match

After only three months of sentence

Fiendish predator was released

Refrain

Stalk the prey, chase the hunter

Make your pray, regret your blunderYou watch us take the stage
The power gets your blood running hot
We know no other way

Black Rock N' Roll(Instrumental)Many aeons ago, 
before the human race, 
(the) darkest emanations 
ruled upon the Earth. 

There is an ancient tale 
from the warriors of the west. 
It tells about 
a brave who crossed the vast ocean. 

Quetzalcoatl! 

Quetzalcoatl, an ancient god 
of the extinct Mayan civilization. 
He had a beard and white skin, 
odd for the local folk. 

Quetzalcoatl came from the east sea 
and returned whence he came 
promising to return. 

And his final destiny 
nobody knows... 

Mayan, a superior civilization. 
They had so much knowledge, 
like astronomy, architecture, theater, 
writing, magic and prophecies, 
mathematics, medicine... 

Many knowledge (and books) 
brought by 

Quetzalcoatl! 

Immortal is the knowledge in those ancient books, 
which came from the orient 
by the hands of this brave being, 
who crossed the vast ocean 
to reach his final destiny. 
The last (last?) of his quests. 

Who really were you? 

Quetzalcoatl?!(Instrumental)(Corkhill, Trad. Scandinavian)

High above shinning steel
Flyga hverjan dag
A chilling wind now blows in the north
Setting course for the raven's flight
Jormungrund yfir

Over the hills, through valley and field
Flyga hverjan dag
A chilling tale now comes from the north
Ravens fly in the blood red sky
Jormungrund yfir

The beating of wings
The howl of the wind
Bright summer sun reddened with blood
That which once was green
Now scorched, blackened with ash
Days grow cold under dark wings

That which is fed on the lives of men
And leads men to their deaths
Flying above, searching, wandering
Never wondering...

High above shinning steel
Flyga hverjan dag
The dawn is met with of black
How the winds now blow so strong
Jormungrund yfir
Carrying wings of black

The distant skies of ancient times
Flyga hverjan dag
Above the realms of forest, valley and sea
How the winds now blow so strong
Jormungrund yfir
Carrion wings of black(Instrumental)Desire so healing is waking
Stream of passion obsessing
A doom unknown that's breaking through
A heat inside that's flaming
Calling of the dark ages
Spectral visions born from the fire
Approaching...

Fires don't leave me
Stay trustful in my last stand
Those bursting hours
(I'm) afraid to choose my next step

Flesh and blood now addicted
Looking for the dark secrets
Pure undisputed fear
Obey the old gods dancing
Touch the gleeds forgiving
Embrace the spirits in the fire
Approaching...
Fires don't leave me
Stay trustful in my last stand
Those bursting hours
(I'm) afraid to choose my next step

Drifting truth
It came to an end
Take away my youth
Lost and found
The roots of my tree
I'll get back to youI look deep within my soul
To find I'm not what I seem
I present nothing to fear
But beyond the skin there is something to beware
A wolf in sheep's clothing
The blood, the breath, the bone
There will be nothing left of you
You were safer alone

I prowl the night, you on the edge of a knife
I feel duality wage it's war you should 
Have stayed in your home
It took me no time at all
To unlock all that you feel
To sense what makes you scream
Can you tell if this is real

Is there any way out
Can I unlock the combination
Can I become something more
Is there a rehabilitation

A wolf in sheep's clothing
The blood, the breath, the bone
There will be nothing left of you
You are all alone

I prowl the night, you on the edge of a knife
I feel duality wage it's war you should 
Have stayed in your home
It took me no time at all
To unlock all that you feel
To sense what makes you scream
Can you tell if this is real
I fight with demons inside
But there's nowhere I can hide

I am the shadow
That darkness fears
I'll bring you nothing but dread
I am the hunter
And you are my victim
You will know death, you will know death

It took me no time at all
To unlock all that you feel
To sense what makes you scream
Can you tell if this is real
I am the wolf, wolf in sheep's clothing
I am the blood
The blood, the breath, the boneNo future no future
 No future at all
 No money no job
 You've got fuck all

[Chorus]
 Chaos is my life
 Chaos is my life
 Chaos is my life

 Another fucking restart
 Is waiting for you
 The future is fucked
 More chaos for you

[Chorus]
 Chaos is my life
 Chaos is my life
 Chaos is my life

 Don't let the bastards
 Get to you
 The future is chaos
 And chaos is you

[Chorus]
 Chaos is my life
 Chaos is my life
 Chaos is my life

 Chaos is my life [x4](Instrumental)(Instrumental)Tunge dr'mmer samlet de vindfylte heimer til samraad

Eternal Champion. Multiverse of the mind
Everything he wrote somehow intertwined
Michael Moorcock born in 1939! 
The Sundred Worlds! The Wrecks of Time!
Moor...cock..cock...cock! Moor...cock..cock...cock!

Moorcock smoked pot with Lemmy
You think you wrote a lot of books, he wrote twice as many
Von Beck was Mike's Grandad
Best Eternal Champion a kid ever had
The Golden Barge or any of his stories
Ironic fables, simple allegories

Hawkwind and Moorcock write books and rock
Moor...cock..cock...cock! Moor...cock..cock...cock!I'm the night you walk into
As if you were the full moon
You're the ray of hope cutting through
The crepulcular depths of my wild heart
You're the sunlit aurora
And I'm a snow-covered plain
You glide through like a ghost
I'm astonished by your limpid purity
The moment all creation became silent
To stare in amazement at the beauty
Without you I am a summer day without sunshine
My dreams merged with yours
My soul loomed from darkness
To bask in your radiance
A demon's dancing with an angel
The sea of time will thunder over
And there'll be nothing left
They'll keep walking along the path we trampled down
And we now know it leads nowhere
I've made my sacrifice to fulfil our life dream
Our pact will remain a secret
Just like your undisclosed past and origin
I'll take care of you and mold your character
To my liking and you will fill your mind
with reconcilliation after a long struggle
Then when my time comes
I'll walk into the bosom of your realm
To become part of the circle
A perfect harmonyDark fog came up, from deep down the woods,
when thousands of warriors where drawn to battle,
to defend their people.
They nether knew regret nor pain,
hate at the enemy was growing mightier.
It was time to draw the swords, to begin a new war.
The sky was darkening, when the hosts crashed together,
only hate, fire and cold steel dominated the happening.
Signed from the battle the enemy tried to flee,
but there was no escape.
Last cry's for help could be heard,
in a battle where hope was lost long before.
The ground was covered with dead bodies,
and earth was drunk with blood,
so it was called, the battle of eternal hate.
No light of the world should see this place again,
The only thing that was left,
was a shadow full of sorrow and fear.Under me grows out a shadow not of mine,
It was created on the shores of decades of fire,
this burning form scorches the grass under my feet
and wilts the flowers of the graceful plains,

Draining the life giving waters
that culminated the dismal souls of night,
The lingering darkness creeps behind me
and stalks the meadows that we gather,

Streaking across the sky with unholy wings,
Soar through the Transylvanian pyre for my kindred,
Those of Earthly born- await the arrival...
where infernal ancient years doomed me,

An ancient blackness far north
migrated to my lands that called out in silence,
So many years in the bowels of Hel I wait
and suddenly the world had changed,

The shadow that stalks
the bloodlines of enemy of night
pushes on as each gets set ablaze,

A flaming shadow below me
What feeds this eternal darkness?
What harvests the evil obsessed minds?

Mystic shadow in the mirror
in to which I gazed-in those infernal ancient years!


(All lyrics are property of Ravenhelm)(Instrumental)Welcome to my inner world, baby
I dont feel either pain or hate
I just dont know whether you can carry the weight of my fervour
On the whole Im happy and satisfied
Perhaps I just feel a little bitter aftertaste of my silliness
Which I have learnt to swallow like alcohol gained from oil
Forgive me I did not perceive you at the moment when kisses from star were coming and my
transcendental memory was ousting everything passing
I cannot explain why these abnormal states take such a long time
You should have kept your mouth shut and watch soap operas
Anyway, it suits you best when you are under, turning your cheek with mouth open(Instrumental)Our campfires burn all around to fill the dark with light
In us burn black flames of hate, by daybreak we will fight

The sun creeps through the breath of night up in the morning sky
The land still lies in mystic haze, the wolves had stopped to cry

Lances, shields and grinded swords blaze in the rays of sun
Our banners float in northern winds, hostile blood shall run

Last prayers to the battlegods, then horses paw the ground
Bursting bodies, agony, and gore is all around

From the eternal sky I hear the bloodbirds cry
Hold the ensign high, do not be afraid to die

We are those who will bring to you war and death and fear
Demand for war burns in our hearts, battle is always near

The smell of death decreases, the battle has been won
Hymns of war and victory rise up to Wodan's throne

Tyr, immortalize our swords

The fire what gives birth to fame is eternally inside
Reflected by our armament these flames will always light

Victory is ours

We are those who will bring to you war and death and fear
Warlike demand burns in us, battle is always nearMisery!
My flame is burning! It's burning higher
Look into my demon eyes. Watch me arise.
I'm a demon with thousand faces
Faces so cold as ice!

I am the face of madness and pleasure
I am the face of death and terror
"Say my name"... and you will die
mortal souls I take
makes me immortal.

Tragedies!
My flame is burning; it's burning higher.
Look into my demon eyes. Watch me arise
I'm a demon with thousand faces.
Faces so cold as ice.

I am the face of madness and pleasure
I am the face of death and terror.

You will be captured inside of me.
Living rest of your life in sodomy.
I bring your mind, your soul, your flesh and blood
Down into darkness.
...and take you in to a eternal maze

A demonic ablaze are streaming through your veins.
I seduce you into the night as I draw your soul
Into tragedies.Where our world is - the land of full moon?
Will that once had been ever come back?
Where's your pride, White Man?
Has the cross veiled your eyes?

For thousand years strangers kept this land to dishonour
To the people of strange blood you've sold your honour
Your forefathers call you to avenge their blood
The heritage of ancestors which you have to fulfil

But now the time has come!
You must wake and call the oath
Millenium of disgrace you'll erase
Because your blood ordains you this!

There are legions of those like you left
Go that we can take revenge for forefather's tears
Golden cross symbol of Europe's extinction
We stand by your side, warrior pride is what leads us!

Loyalty is our honour - loyalty to our blood
Go awake - Aryan and handle the sword
Time has come now
Thousand years of disgrace to erase!Gebrechlichkeit (Burzum cover)

Tears from the eyes so cold, tears from the eyes, in the grass so green. 
As I lie here, the burden is being lifted once and for all, once and for all. 
Beware of the light, it may take you away, to where no evil dwells. 
It will take you away, for all eternity. 
Night is so beautiful (we need her as much as we need Day).Against the stone, against the land
Forged in rage of ever starving flame
Pyres fed with firstborn of man
No tideless sea your fire could tame

Clarion call of Craionhorn

No ravines echo your storm, no writhing heart heeds your call
No hands left with warmth reach for tales forlorn

Chained in your frame is what was lost, what was sigh,
What was the deemed as last breath of god
Chained in your frame is what was all, what has been,
What was winds blowing never silent

Hollow bone of the timeless wyrm
Gold that never shined in sun
Envenomed blood of every martyr
Steel blackened in sins left undone

No sight shunned beyond, no voice life banished from everlasting song
No men this age has born crave to hear the silenced horn

No longer hear they call...Those times, those feelings last in our soul
Mistic mountains at the crack of twilight arch
And dark forests hide eternel call
For those who feel this undead pain 
Forever more unchain our will for freedom
Let`s keep this memory alive 
In to our heart in to our mind
The Memory Forever will be alive
When we will reach out
what cannot find
Winds of sorrow fall in our heart
Marching through thy woods
Where day is night and night is light
Ous minds fly above the mountain sky
And memories forgotten begin to rise again
Let`s keep this memory alive
In to our heart in to our mind
The Memory Forever will be alive
When we will reach out
what cannot findDead flesh, blood hundreds of years old
Pallid of death, demon faces the heart of Satan
Screams of bestial voices
Comes from somewhere beyond

The moon is borned by a evening red
It rise with heart of Satan
The nightside creatures
Hidden in the shadow of the moon

It's like the dead arise
Demon faces, pure of evil
Blood is life...
Blood is life for them who serve Satan

Blood, sex and mysteries in the name of Satan
For humans just tales made from a mad man's mind

But for humans are blinded by these things
They cannot see the truth
They are Satan's heartbeat on earth
And his heart will beat eternally(Instrumental)(Instrumental)There's no reason to remain here
There is nothing left to wonder
But the cage has only one exit
To the sweet home six feet under

If there's no more world outside and
Your perception is deceiving 
The only way to spend your time is
Ah! Immersion in a dreaming

And when we fall asleep
Our personal demons leave us for a while
There's no more narrow cage
There's no more impotent rage
And we can afford a luxury of ingenuous smile

Is your remembrance real
Or it's just a slice of dream?
Wild riding through the plains
Within a frenzied stream
But since your cage is locked
You can not run away
So never awaken!

When you wake up dull your senses
Your life belongs to someone else
Who plays with you like with a puppet
And your role is less than nothing

Hide away your tears and anguish
Hide away your righteous anger
Pray that nobody gets to know
You still can represent a danger

So guess what's wrong with you
How did you trap yourself?
Did you agree to live
Inside this silent hell
But since your cage is locked
You can not run away
So never awaken!

And when we fall asleep
Our personal demons leave us for a while
There's no more narrow cage
There's no more impotent rage
And we can afford a luxury of ingenuous smile

Is your remembrance real
Or it's just a slice of dream?
Wild riding through the plains
Within a frenzied stream
This sleep will waste your life
Must be another way
Oh, so can you wake up?

Now crush the hated doors
If you are still untamed
Do take the life that's yours
And live it 'till the end
And even if you fail
It would be worthy try
So wake up for the last time.(Instrumental)I enter and see the most illustrious halls
Feast of kings await
Musicians are heard singing a song
To the pride of every woman and man

The kings sits in a throne borne from an oak
Whispers litter the hall
The men throw unknowing eyes as I approach
To ask for council with the king

King Olan, help me find my kin
A great dishonour has been done to me

Ah Faolan you have to ask me questions
About your missing kin

Look to the south of these lands
There is a place known among the olde ones
Known only to a few
There is a place through the white of Olcanath
You will find the answers you seek but you must be quick
To the high goddess Ulin
She will guide you

But take heed brave warrior for this will not be an easy task

It is a treacherous one at best...

As you leave from these hallowed halls
Remember, the three gifts must never meet
From the forge a hand of bronze
Where trees and hills everlast!

I hear a call familiar yet ancient
Eyes of the white stag himself
I leave the halls with you, my horse and weapons
Roaring into the ether

I see white fields, white trees, OlcanathHAMMER AGAINST THE CROSSES

Into the deep winter forest
Iron between trees well hiden
A hundred of brave pagan soldiers
Ready to attack this night

Iron against the lies   Hammers against the crosses   Defenders of our land
A trap for our enemy   Glory for our gods   Waiting to attack

Here comes them, weak sheep
We rise our sword to the sky
In a few seconds they will see
How a pagan warrior fights

Silence in the woods   Cold nocturnal winds   Darkness in our hearts
Snow cover the fields   The moon shines bright   The war has begun

We appear from the shades
Our eyes shines
Between howls of rage
I taste their blood
and then we scream

ATTACK

This is our rage
an this is your defeat
the blood covers the snow
and their mutilated bodies
protecting our land
fighting for our people
for our warrior faith
for our identity

We return to our village
and while we are marching
we shout our proclaim:
HONOUR, HONOUR, HONOUR AND PRIDE(Instrumental)Bombs are falling 
Falling hard and fast
No one knew how long
The attack would last

Flames on water 
Total Destruction
Sinking ships 
Dying men of honor

Bombs are falling 
Falling hard and fast
No one knew how long
The attack would last

Caught off guard
Defence on hold
In the early morning 
Seen by none 
Their attack was complete

Bombs are falling 
Falling hard and fast
No one knew how long
The attack would last

Flames on water 
Total Destruction
Sinking ships 
Dying men of honorGrinding the ground
Hellfuck demon sound
Spitting forth the flames
Bursting from the gates
This is goat war
This is goat war
Tormenting the meek
Slaughtering the weak
Hammering down the law
This is goat war
This is goat war
This is goat warIn dark silence words are spinning
Whisperings of a new beginning
They observe the repercussion
Unwinding the next discussion

Indirection deep inside
A road corpse-strewn loads far and wide
And those whom God wishes the worst
He angers with injustice first

Emotions all repressed and bound
They just can't find a way around
Handcuffed tightly 'round the wrists
In unconsciousness nothing exists

Nature has no morals
Like the forest dwellers tell
It's better to live badly
Instead of dying well

Your morals are like hollow shells
A message from invisible bells
Your values are like silent gold
That speaks from voices dead and cold

I find my way and as I dare
I dream without the need to share
I'll hack my way through densest green
And cover all the horrors seen

I'll hack my way through densest green (8x)With his new supernatural force 
It was able to throw away 
The drakkar again into to the sea, 
In a single push, 
With so much force that he collapsed in the sand until the waist. 
The drakkar rose proud, it navigated. 
The tiny ones had not been able to damage it. 

The draugr loaded 
The drakkar
With dead meat
The the killed it 
Before
An the drakkar
Supported,
Noble,
That putrified load. 

Two oars moved the ship
The draugr rowing, looking at
His hands
Black as coal.
Advancing, slowly 
Summoning the wind
The oceans
The streams
The water
The clouds 

The clouds obeyed him, and 
The waters listened to his orders, 
Dragging the drakkar like a dagger offered to Thor,
While he came closer moment to moment 
To the place of rest. 
When he came closer to the warm seas 
He crossed with another ship. 
A ship of strange fashion, 
Not with glorious Nordic print, 
With pompous and proud silhouette. 
The draugr crossed the drakkar in its road 
And he approached it under the form of a gull. 
Then he recovered his monstrous effigy 
And he allowed to restrain for his hate to the life. 
He pulled up arms and legs, he beheaded, 
He milled bones and skulls. 
Nobody survived, neither nobody would never find out 
Of the luck of the unfortunate ship.It hailed so fast
We could not see the headland through it
Send for crows send the ravens
Thought and memory
Came back to me
Painted runes upon my starry eyes
Through twisted creaking boughs
Three sisters slice trough time
We raised our horns to the three Norns
Our forefather's philosophy
Creaks in the green trees
Aching to be embraced again
The staves tell a tale
Of what was once
And what is now
And what could be
And what could be

Gifu is the gift I aspire to give
To drink from fountains
Deep wells that stare
All through my starry eyes.
If I stop to take it
It just drifts away
But all things come to
Those who live by
The steel and the rune(Instrumental)Truth will prevail

We are all locked up in the cage which is called freedom.
Smiling face but within rage Where is the our wisdom?
Our creativity is the weapon They fear.
Integrity has changed my dear.
RE:
Truth will prevail, remove all lies.
Rather go to the jail, than be part of an empire.
Stand up, make a fist and be the hero.
Or be a slave, listen sheeps and die equal zero.
2x

Thousands years have passed, years of oppression killed an ancient kind
Gave a rise to mind enslavement,
where same and simple answers took its part
And blood is the easiest payment

Flames are rising high, burning bridges of the past times,
bringing forward promise of a new era.
Giving rebirth to glory of mortal cycles
and slaying the immortal as cholera.

My heart is awake
No one can take it from me.
The tree of life has been found
I hear universe I obey
My heart is awake
No one can take it from me.
The tree of life in our DNA.
I know the truth will prevail.

Ref.
Truth wiLying there by the corpses Of the fallen ones You wonder about Crawling to safety Then in front of you Stands a glorious man He helps you up And hands you a sword "Go fight the enemy, for it is us or them, do it for your life and your families, this is our final hour" Now you are invincible Plowing your way to the front line You catch a glimpse of your countries glorious flag After the battle After the smoke clears You lay down your sword Swearing never to use it again You will be forever known as a heroLyric by Igniis Inferniis

Awakened by the wolves
I wander through eternal winter nights
Where tales of old hordes
Are recited to the moon...
The wolves that howl their song
To the southern winds

I follow the moon covered by the fog
The moonlight guides me in my journey
In the darkness I hear the voices
Of a thousand lost souls

My ancestors call my name
Beyond the frozen mountains
My ancestors fought for their ideals
They realized the truth...they lived free

And that's the way I live...free!!!

Longing for those old times
I'm thirsty of blood and of war
Beyond the green fields
I hear the screams of the pagan battles
The twilight of a thousand invincible blades

Hateful hordes under the silver moon
In the eternity of past times...
My soul flows through the times...
Candles wet in blood
Burning my most impure desires
The pleasure of flesh and sins
The pagan cult on the cross in flamesFire and wind come from the sky
From the gods of the sky
But Krom is your god and he lives in the earth
Once giants lived in the earth brother
And darkness of chaos
They fooled krom and took from him
The enigma of steel
Krom was angry and the earth shook
And fire and wind struck down these giants
And threw their bodies in the waters
But in their rage
The gods forgot the riddle of steel and
Left it on the battle field
The ones who found it are just men
Not gods, not giants, just men
And the secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery
You must learn its riddle brother
You must learn its discipline
For no one 
No one in this world can you trust
Not men, not women, not beasts
For no one in this wold can you trust
This (steel) you can trust.


(lyrics taken from the film "Conan the Barbarian")My heart seems to burst
But my thoughts are clear and free
I need to get away from this cursed place
I want to live my own life
They will not lock me in, anymore
My hate assists the buildup of adrenine

They will not trap me
It's my descision to be free
They will not trap me
...Can't pull me down on my knees

Let me breathe... even if I could fail
Don't I deserve a chance for a normal life?
They tried to infiltrate me
To detect my deepest thoughts
I'll escape from this prison called insane asylum

They will not trap me
It's my descision to be free
They will not trap me
...Can't pull me down on my knees(Instrumental)In the beginning our land
Were free and we lived in liberty

But the time of pain
Has come and our lands were destroyed

Soldiers that kill
In name of god without feeling and pain

The pagan tears were shed
In memory of our ancient ones

Chorus:
Inside of a nightmare
Fearing for my fears
Lost in my dreams
Alone fighting in despair

The stone of lamentation
Our children cry and they shout for justice

The blood that was shed
In the battlefields will never be forgotten

The sadness left our people
Will be avenged one day without mercy

In our battlesongs
These days will always be reminded

Chorus
Chorus
ChorusTears fall from my eyes when I look to this land
Many were the emotions that here I lived
Are still on my mind the friends I've lost
And the blood that was spilt


My life belongs to this place
Its beauty makes the difference to me
But now I don't have time anymore
We have to look forward, move on


Many warriors are still to come
And I praise them, because their lives already belong to this landTo the gates bearing this frown,
the threatening forces storm the grounds,
ceasing escape, our pain must drown!

Once moved freely through these lands,
retaining crown under demands,
rising solid we shall stand...
for our command!

Storming oppression,
the last obsession,
last rites before
a life no more.

Storming oppression,
no false conception,
my rites for more
apply no more.

Doors of oppression must come down,
to the gates pleading in frown,
determination gains the crown.

Storming firmly for the throne,
mighty fortress overthrown,
falsely forbidden we were left...
but not to rest!

Storming oppression,
the last obsession,
last rites before
a life no more.

Storming oppression,
no false conception,
my rites for more
apply no more.

AHHH!Din lume dusa, in ceat-ascunsa

white sails, bring death.
I don't percieve cold sea.
White fog again, where it dispears?

Only dream? I saw her...
She is dancing in my dreams, gives me hand of eternity.
I know, what i feel, when armour turn weight.
This warm on breath is burning like devil

I see the ships,
beautiful ships
with dragon head on waves,
fast ships of ash.

I see the ships, i feel wind,
squeezes through my hair.
And smoke nips in my eyes.
White fog, she is dancing again.
I sit by table and she brings tankard.ASTAPA'S ASHES

CELTIBERIAN CITADEL, OVERNIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE ENEMY.
JUDGED AND CONDEMNED BY MARCIUS' ARMIES, THE ARMIES OF ROME.
CONDEMNED FOR BEING LOYAL TO THEIR TRADITIONS,
THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR BLOOD.

MOUNTAINS OF GOLD AND SILVER,
MOUNTAINS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN ROSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN.
THEY ELECTED TO DIE BEFORE TO FALL IN THE INVADER'S DOMINION 
AND TO LIVE WITHOUT HONOUR.

FIFTY WARRIORS WITH A HORRIBLE DESTINY WERE ENTRUSTED TO GUARD THEM.
THE UNJUST BATTLE MARCHED ON.
THE INVADER'S SUPREMACY WEAKENS BY THE CELTIBERIAN ANGER.
DEATH CAME OVER THE WARRIORS, A PRIDEFUL DEATH.
RIVERS OF BLOOD FLEW THROUGH FLAMES AND WEALTH.
ASTAPA WAS BURNING.

FLAMES OF HONOUR, COLLECTIVE SUICIDE, 
ASHES OF A GREAT TOWN WHICH LAYER UNDER THE LIVE COALS.
THEY DECIDED TO DIE WITH HONOUR, NEITHER TO LIVE LIKE SLAVES.
NO VALUABLE OBJECT REACHED THE ENEMY'S BLOODY HANDS.

THEY ONLY MANAGED TO DECREASE THEIR ARMY.
HUNDREDS OF ROMANS DIED, MANY BEFORE THE ARMOURED RESISTANCE, 
THE REST UNDER THE FLAMES OF THEIR AVARICE.
THE WASTEFUL BLOOD FEEDS SINCE CENTURIES OUR THIRST FOR REVENGE AND FATE.

MARCIUS WINS THE BATTLE BUT HE LOST MUCH MORE
BETWEEN THE STRONG WALLS OF ASTAPA.Driftwood-like, my course unknown
Charred by flame, bitten by frost
Soaked by waves, hardened by wind
Scraped from tongues, hushed by ink
Vanquished, not vanished
Sought by living, fueled by death
Utterly pleasant, eternal blame
One man's rest, another one's woe

Onward to the fevered shores
Foaming blood
A canopy of ice and fire
Watches above
And roaming is the traveler
Called by names
And sung of in the halls at home
By the flamewhen dead calm reigns over land
true freedom gets lost in silence
and boredom rises behind my ax
weary of chopping only dead wood.
as the moon grows in the night
my lust to fight guides me as a light,
glory of bottle is not a memory
only clattering swords can set my soul free.

we all are now ready to fight
where our ancestors once lost their lives
to rise  beside our brothers and fathers
into the battle we have to struggle.
rise comrades and crush our enemy
smell the scent of blood drying on your skin
by my flesh and my beating heart
I swear to pass away on a battlefield.

if you fight you shall save your life
until the day you will die
give up would be so unwise
hold out my son.

as the sun sets behind the mountain
ride through the cold alongside the rain
be ready for the valhalla at the dusk
cause in the blood of war you will trust.
don't be afraid of the rising swords
in front of us there is an iron gate
leading straight toward another land
heading to the place you keep living.The doom awakening foreseen light years ago
Punishment in flames approaching like a molten sky

Wrath in his eyes blazing
This burning god appears
The watcher out gazing
A distant thunder draws near

Creator of what was righteous awaits to make his stand
Targets the world with his anger, his hammer strikes down

Wrath in his eyes blazing
This burning god appears
Merciless out there gazing
A burning death draws near

Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies
Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies

The doom awakening foreseen light years ago
Out of the molten sky, his hammer strikes down

Wrath in his eyes blazing
This burning god appears
Merciless out there gazing
A burning death draws near

Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies
Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies

Across the sky his torching course
Such agony, blistering force
The flames engulf, fires collide
Burnt to a crisp, ashes remain

Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies
Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies

Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies
Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies(Instrumental)I feel the wrath and fury leading me to skyways of the unknown
the reigns of the golden chariot I keep
Master of winds I guide the stallions of Helios
Through mystic clouding shapes I verge in heavens
Through rainbows I fade as one of legends 
I am the newborn god in fiery colours
the celestial keeper, life giver and taker
Now I ride the stallions, now I lead the chariot
now I melt all glaciers, now I dry all oceans
Past and present do melt in heat and fire
In disorder and chaos death hailings I shout
The reigns of the golden chariot I keep
It won't be for more
It shall not last any long
The end to the ill-fated ride,
an end to my ill-fated fight
Now I ride the stallions, now I lead the charion
Now I dance in flames, now I crash on waters
Newborn legend in holy waters, untamed my life
given and taken
In waters of Eridanus I charred shall remain untamed
I feel nor sad nor pity
I live in my legend, Phaethon, I, the Helion child
I'm free in my legend, Phaethon, the fire child.Embedded in the deepest ice
the face of my brother no longer exist,
a crafted soul in the finest crucible
that birthed such a being, 

Above the frigid snow that drifts such
lingers his soul from a day of better time,
Under a sky that is red of the purest of blood
the mystic prophecy is now dawned upon as wisdom fades,

By the Nordic nightshade of damnation
Now that you shall eternally rise,
by the principles of the fading resolution
this soul now is set ablaze,

As the soul walks over the arcane water...
Archaic tongues can be effectively heard from the darkening mist,

A theory strengthens the coming storm....
a storm of fire, a storm of un-melting ice
that cast from the very depths of the mist of Nifleheim,

A feeling that I can no longer embrace
as these dreams that was once a cherished treasure,
no longer do they cleanse the thought of this road
that his soul has grown weary and tired for paradise,

An aura we once knew as father
bore the life that mated with such purest fog
in the motherland of the Norse wind, 

Unlike that storm of ignorance...
Your vermin has multiplied for too damn long!!!





(All lyrics are property of Ravenhelm/Munnin)Youll die - a painful death 
Im your God - of torture and perversion 
Thousands of dead or living humans are taken for experiments 
Fear of medics; medics who dont help you at all 

Objects for science and research, victims of perverts in white 
Human material for studying 
Murdered by collection of brains, infected with diseases 
Unvoluntary experimental subjects 
Cruel despise of all the defenceless 

Testing of hunger: How long can you live without eating? 
Victims of vaccinations end with ?exitus? - In most cases 
Invalids and cripples with special feeding- 
No bread and no flesh 

Paradise for perverts (4x) 

Months of awfully pining away 

Paradise for perverts (2x) 

No hope to end the struggle, 
Killing a jew with a syringe 
Directly into the heart 
All this in the name of medicine, 
How perverse can it get? 

Paradise for perverts (2x) 

Hidden cellar, citadel of horror, poison gas tested on humans 
Bursting of lungs, corroding of skins, starring eyes, asphixiation 
Deforming the face, bleeding tears, 
Endless suffering, colossal pain 

All this in the name of medicine, 
How perverse can it get? 

Carving the stomach, cut off the head and preparing the teeth 
Torture chamber kills with below atmospheric pressure, 
Getting blind 
Paralysed, spasms, madness, death the result 

Dissected alive, death by cold 
Cutting deep wounds to the bone 
Or smashing them with a hammer 
Incredible agony 
Why did you let it happen?When I see the light,
I wake up and I begin to feel

It's the pain on my flesh
By all pleasure I gave
They're the entrails inside of me
Which lodge a thousand men

I sometimes think
That this is not happening,
Hoping to wake up of this dream
My life is shit,
An eternal dream of pain

Confused solitude

There's nobody around me
My body is bleeding...

Pain! Pleasure!
The dying whore!

A shadow at the door
I start to bleed again
It's coming, it's coming

The shadow is over me
I can't move,
The shadow inside,
Inside of me...Come hear the moon is calling
The witching hour draws near
Come hear the bell is tolling
Mortals run in fear
Prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry
Hold fast the sacrifice
For now it's the time to die
All hell breaks loose
Hell's breaking loose

Unveil the pentagram
And feel the demon's lust
Come watch the holy men
Who look on in disgust
Come taste blood
And feel the heat of Satan's breath
Look in the sky's and see
The warriors of death
All hell breaks loose
Hell's breaking loose
Witching hour

Our work is now complete
The blood runs fast and free
And Satan takes his bride
And cry's of blasphemy
All hell rejoices at the child
That she will bear
And Satan's only son
Shall be the world's despair
All hell breaks loose
Hell's breaking loose
Witching hour(Instrumental)Habuimus pondus, constantiam
In hoc impio iniustu bello,
Utinam haec faccinora
Sint exemplum orbi
Sed non satis libertando
impetum ac strenuitatem
Populus sine virtute
Duccitur ad servituten

Shine the flames of courage and strength 
And the reward of joyful freedom
Of the people that will never be enslaved
That it be a model for all the world
The deeds of noble folk of heroes and braves
That are independent and never be enslaved

Apud nos revivit Athenae
Tyranos ad perterrendum
ut simus Danaos in Gloria

Sed non satis libertando

The ones that observe us and evaluate our actions
Will remind for centuries our efforts and will raise our blazons...
We showed the spirit of our values in an impious and vigorous war
And that our bravery and virtues may be a model for all the world...Why do you drink and drive 
While you can smoke and fly? ...In '41 fandom was young, and Asimov's name was on every tongue
'Cuz in '41 Nightfall had come
Planet driven insane by an eclipse of the sun
A pair of lush sideburns & a bolo tie describes
The genius who brings us the story of I, Robot
So what, the term was coined by Kapec?
The Three Laws of Robotics ain't been broken yet!
Hey! He had to get paid writing fiction, non-fiction, teaching biochemistry
Fact: He wore so many hats. 
Was in the Navy with Heinlein & L. Sprague De Camp!
No big thing, 'til Campbell took him under his Astounding wing
Foundation published before his sideburns had even grown an inch!
Psycho-historian, prophetic creation
Mule had to go and fuck up the equation
That's what you get when you make a sport of mutation!After three winters
The prophecy came true
Rumours said the sons of Fenris
Devoured the sun and the moon

Nine worlds of eternal night
The time has finally come
Odin gathered his army
Sitting on his magic throne

The earth shook setting old enemies free
The dwarves are working restlessly
From Musspel the giants are coming
Full of hate their eyes are burning

The gods await beyond the rainbow bridge
For Fenris, Surt, Garm and Loki
Horns will sound for the last time
In the bloody fields of Vigrid

In the end nothing will remain
And even the sky will burn
When Yggdrasil falls
A new world will be born

The gods await beyond the rainbow bridge
For Fenris, Surt, Garm and Loki
Horns will sound for the last time
In the bloody fields of VigridAutumn has returned along with rooks 
rain is cleasing the air of the dust from the roads 
clouds of steam are slinking in the hills 
and bringing dreams of ages past 
a pack of dogs are playing with children 
Horses are running along plaints 
it s peaceful and quiet 
The dreaming land slowly desappear in the mist 
and at once something becomes cold in our hearts 
Trees are falling a sleep 
All is so silent 
As though time has spopped for a while to wish us to remember 
We have known each other for a long timeI CAME FROM FAR AWAY TO TALK TO YOU, MONOLITH,
TO PRAY AND TELL YOU A STORY OF YEARS AGO.
I HAVE CROSSED RIVERS, RAIN AND COLD.
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, ALL WAS DIFFERENT IN MY VILLAGE,
A LITTLE COMMUNITY WITH ITS AUTONOMY.
ONE DAY, A MAN CAME FROM OTHER VILLAGE.
TOLD US ABOUT INVASION OF OTHER PEOPLE
WITH BREASTPLATES AND SHORT HAIR.
UNDER THEIR BANNERS, AN EAGLE, ROME.
ALL PEOPLE WAS PREPARING, MAKING WEAPONS AND SWORDS,
THIS WAS THE PATH OF REAL ESSENCE. 
RAISING PALISADES AND DEFENCES.
EVEN US, THE CHILDREN, WERE READY.
SOME MOONS LATER,
WE DISCRIED A LARGE ARMY,
WELL STRUCTURED, 
WHICH ADVANCED SLOWLY.
ALARM WAS GIVEN, 
AND ALL GOT PREPARED.
THE ARMY STOPPED AND FORMED
A STRANGE GROUP.
MEN ENTERED AT WAR, 
PROTECTED BY SOME SPEARS.
THE REST RESISTED INSIDE THE VILLAGE.
ALL WHO I EVER MET FOUGHT FOR THEIR LIVES
WHOLE FAMILIES SCREAMED IN SWEAT AND BLOOD.
IT WAS THE END, 
WE WERE THE SLAVES OF AN EMPIRE.
THE LEADER WAS KILLED
AND THE WISE ELDERS TOO.
THOSE WHMusic: Panos Arvanitis 
Lyrics: G.Hadjisimeon, P. Dedes 

Marching through time every 
Passing day of my life 
Seems like it doesn't exist 
I'm wasting my time 
Waking memories of a life 
With which I've never agreed 

But how can I change everything 
and forget that my life 
someday'll come to an end 
And how can I stop all 
this marching of time 
which is killing and making new lives 

Facing the power of yesterday 
I feel like I'm old, weak and tired 
The only escape is another life 
without time or any desire 

I know where to find it, 
I know where to search 
To make my life again 
in a place where myself 
will be a two-faced man 
the one real and the other a lie 

Visions are calling me 
to hide my destiny 
and save my power for life 
Escaping from my misery 
by facing the reality 
just like a mirror out of time 

Memories of suffered life: 
break the mirror 
Visions are calling me to hide 
crash the mirrorShe hill their eyes
wanting to find that lost
shade
in total darkness
and she flew
she flew
like the smoked of a crossed
blaze sanctified
she burned and she in an
instant in smoke was
converted
she travel happy and
exquisite
now you know what it is
now you know what it is
She swallow the pill of the
eternal happiness
aspirin of eternal remedy
a clean and pure end
never you like to be informal
who cry hypocritical tears
because now and not when
one of her
it had put a stop to this pain
it had stopped this pain
it had stopped this solitude
bud broken of a cut
before being flower
beautiful rose of their robbed
grace
and she opened their eyes
and she in front of her found
a light
all an illuminated and
beautiful life
amplified in all their
pleasures
thanks to a dream
fewer wrong than was not
real
fewer wrong than was not
real
was not real(Instrumental)Wicked eyes, see how she so beautiful dies
Storm full skies takes her
Into the chaotic underworld.
See her eyes behind the shadow
In the thunderously silence.
See her grim and majestic violence

To fill her luscious fears,
To give us thy precious tears.
Give thy self to the mysteries of your night
Now... come inside!
There is no where to despair,
Victory is now here...

A blazed by the mist of terror,
She subsides into the great horror.
Accrue! And touch the black flame
Leather! For thy kingdoms underworld
Has once again opened.
Chaos is all
Chaos is never ending
Oh, lustful whore,
You are mine forever more...Scent of (the) Flying Shadows
are in the Eyes of the Vast Uranus
for these Eyes have seen
the horses of the Universe fade away

Oh, Father (the) Fog of Nebula
your faithful children have escaped
The Walls of Eternity
The Elders Curse-
like Snow of the Solstice of the Sun

and what the Eyes of Uranus can see
Far Yonder in the Shade of the Walls
was happening Milleniums ago
So whatever lies Beyond the Gate
It lies in the Past

Oh, We are the Hordes of Nebula
having Travelled through an Eternal Sea of Void
we glance upon a distant light
Star in the Far; Ye Mighty Sun
Will you Die before We reach you?
Are you a Fatal result of the Laws of Distance?
The Swords of Time are pointing at our Hearts
The grass here seems Raped-
as we face Eternal Misery(Instrumental)I am the black blood
Of this horde. I am the fear of this world
I am the darkest sky, i am the bloody ground
I am the sorrow around
I am the weapon in the hand of fate
For thousand years...Mark the hour
For it bears the end and shape of things to come
Leashed twinborn hearts, flesh an blood
Who will raise the blade to set them apart?

Traitor!
Life to take, bond betrayed
Traitor!
Mere flesh and blood, flesh and blood

Shorn disdain
Trust worn in vain
Let one thing be shed
That ever did us chain

Shrive me not
Repentance long stoked for the lack of hope
Absolve me not, deeds worthy of god
What will fathom the law, the righteous facade?

Bovine mortal line
Prey to kith malign
As world is the smoke
Fire is the will of mineI am the ghost that enforces the divine
sent from the timeless statutes
through the gleaming sstream
which empty into the great nothingness

Riding the silent winds
which are sweeping across
the silent sihouettes
thath lost all it`s wondrous colors

All engulfed by the unlit spell
the ever-beating heart stand still 
while the sunlight turns into raining stars
and lightens through black clouds

Beneath the settling moon
i will bury my untold dreams
hiding from the tarnished eyes
of those who refuse to live

In night`s radiance
the somber realm unfolds to me 
and accursed yet blessed emperor
inheriting the fear-forged crown
In night`s radianceLost in memories, of forgotten love
On hot summer night we were swimming naked under a moon
Lost in dreams, deep pain inside
The picture of deep love burning in my mind

And heavens cried for my love
The night was still as I lifted her body on shore

Nothing to live for, I''m better off dead
I can''t bear the pressure living without you my love

And heavens opened for myself
The night was black as I pulled the trigger of my gun(Instrumental)DE HOGE(lyrics:Ezra, music: Dries)

Drink bier bij het vuur,
glij voort over het ijs.
Koop mager het paard,
het zwaard als het roestig is.

Ik weet dat ik hing,
aan een winderige boom,
negen nachten lang.
Verwond door een speer,
aan Odin gegeven.
Ikzelf aan mijzelf,
aan de stam waarvan niemand weet
uit welke wortels zij groeit.

Ik maak het zwaard van mijn vijanden bot,
wapen noch knots kunnen mij verwonden.
De man die mij kwaad toewenst
wordt eerder dan mij door onheil verteerd.

Ik verkocht mezelf niet 
voor drank en brood.
Ik tuurde lang omlaag.
ik nam de runen op.
Schreeuwend nam ik ze op,
toen voel ik eraf.
Schreeuwend nam ik ze op,
toen viel ik eraf.Life goes on
Dark, yet light
In a spiraling
Twinging void of confusion

Yet, as far off as it seems
The understanding sustains for times
A break in an overcastting fog
Of uncertainty and plight

All the suffering is endured
For the final greatness
Is the greatest of all
And worth the fight

Only with the fight
Can the greatest
Be achieved
Once and for all timeIm a sadistic killer 
Dominated by sanguinary perversities 
Drowned in incestuous phantasies 
Guided by rage and obscure anger 
Show no mercy to my helpless victims 
Raping, mutilating, torturing 
My climax, their endless suffering 
Living in a world of pure cynism 

Mother, daughter, son, youre the next feast 
Absolute control over a little family 
In the claws of a human beast 
Buccal castration, perverse glory 

CHORUS 
Im a sadistic killer 
Ive no remorse 
Im a perverse sinner 
Living by brute force 

Crucify the boy with skrewdrivers 
Hands and feet nailed to the wall 
Tender and sweet life?s downfall 
Young flesh wounded with carving-knives 

Mother nailed on the bloody ground 
Ten-inch nails through hands and knees 
Boys gluey innards in the mouth 
Oh my God, kill me, please! 
Teenage-girl tied with barbed-wires 
Penetrate the virginal cunt, little cries 
Tear off the clitoris with pincers 
Cutted nipples in my fingers 

CHORUS 

After this delicious prelude 
Mom?s glorious hour has come 
In my gory hell, you?re welcome 
Frantic orgasm beyond dispute 
Ejaculate my sperm in her face 
Eat the shit for Lucifers grace 
A last fuck in her opened chest 
With sadistic hunger Im blessed! 

Glorifying destructive sexualiy (2x) 
Mother, daughter, son, youre the next feast 
Absolute control over a little family(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The image of a feeling will live in you, foreverHey beer hearts!

Hail your king and drain your mugs! 

As he'd born they brought him pint 
Gulped it little baby 
Never drunk from mother's dug 
Water made him crazy 
Sober ruled with iron fist 
Blind drunk he fought bravely

One should smash them gaily

Hail the king and drain your mugs! 

Jolly but the end was sad 
Morning heartburn dreadful 
Was no mug before his bed 
Was no brimmer half-full 
As he lied they brought him mug

Drained the water, cursed his men 
Breathed his last, abated

THIS IS THY LAST HARVEST
THIS IS THY LAST HARVEST
Prepare the spears to follow thy evil fortune
A Crusade of Hate to condemn Inferiority
Fire and Flames to punish the skies
Leaden and Grey announcing the end of times
Prepare the spears to follow thy evil fortune
A Crousade of Hate to punish the skies
Among the burning skies
sulphurous Fog is spreading
from the asks of the Last Harvest
Death comes from EarthIn the age before the coming of the Nazarene
Different principles ruled the earth
Men lived not by the grace of false ideals
But by the strength of their arms
and the sharpness of their swords

It was not the weak, the feeble and the cowardly
but the strong and the righteous
who claimed the throne
Hear the whispers of your ancestors,
feel them in your blood
Join us ... in the cult ... of Wuotan!Ravens fly
In the midst of a burning sky
Spreading their wings over the mighty land
like a protecting hand

In the shadow of the raven wings

Valleys and beautiful alleys

Passing underneath the raven's eye
A nature created to live and not to die

Streams and mountains
Valleys and beautiful alleysINTO THE ASHES.......

SHE HAS FACED VERY PAINFUL REALITY
SHE'S DESPERATELY CRYING IN WICKED VOICE

INTO THE ASHES.........In a dream I stand
At the edge of a forest
Sun is about to set
And winds are silent
I hear a falcon scream
And see its shape afar
Against the blazing horizon
Where sky meets the earth

Soon I hear sound in thickets
Someone approaching me
I raise my sword and wait
Ready to strike
Before I see him appear
Wolf already speaks to me
"Do not fear proud warrior
I am the messenger of god"

I've come to teach you secrets
And make you more courageous
The gods are at your side
And yours is the force of thunder
Remember these words and runes
You will know their true meaning
When the moment of desinty
Takes its hour in your life

I wake up and wonder
If it was a dream
It seemed too real to me
I can even smell the forest
First morning light shines
Through the window of my room
And reflects on my sword
Engraved with the runes I was told(Instrumental)Pain
Perpetual

Pain

Treason
Betrayal

Lies - They make you thrive
Lies - Spin your web of deception
Lies - Soaking me up
Lies - Like the sucker I am

Lies - They make you strong
Lies - While I grow weak
Lies - Making the charade complete
Lies - Making the irony come real

Ungrateful, backstabbing, treacherous...
Biting the hand that feeds you
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Smile and the world will laugh in your face
Bleeding me dry of honor and respect
While my anger multiplies

Pain

Treason
Betrayal

Lies - They make you thrive
Lies - While my patience grows him
Lies - Exploiting my naivety

Lies - Creating a killing machineEntity lustrous from the desert of Seth

So cold and breathless she lies.
The soil is covered by frost and the clouds are gathering
Above this beautiful corpse.

Night falls like leaves from a fallen wing of an angel.
Her eyes is pale like her face
And her soul has frozen to ice,
Like a light from a candle
Are dying from a storm at night.

The bane of life seems so sudden meaningless...
From every corner of her soul, she cries.
Still wonder how life would be, this life she'll never see.

The bane of life seems so sudden meaningless...

The soil is covered by frost 
and the clouds are gathering
Above this beautiful corpse.
From every corner of her soul, she cries.
Still wonder how life would be, 
this life she'll never see...

Capture in this beautiful silence.
Dead and forgotten.
Her beauty rest's in darkness...Like sparks the ashes hideously did glow
As over mountains, far beyond the sea,
Above the land of earth they flew to sow
The seeds of the dark age that would then be.

"O mortal race, your back with toil ye'll bow
On field and furrow, you shall prune the tree,
And will thine progeny 'mong troubles grow,
For ventured tread ye where no man should be."

The sterile ground refused mankind to obey
When not forced by the rape of plough and hoe,
And so the ox whom hardly tamed the yoke.

The flood ravaged their corn and fire their hay.
Both earth and sea did cry aloud their woe
The day when the iron king from sleep awoke.Seated up high
on Hildskjalf
Odin's sacred throne
Knowing that this blasphemy
Will not go untold.
And he spies
So far, far away
In Jotunheim.
A sight, the young god Freyr
Cannot believe his eyes

Onwards he charges
no sword in his hand
Righteous fury driving the stag
Freyr you know
your time has come
The pride of the Vanir will come undone

Now the time of Ragnarok
The twilight of the gods
And the army of Aesir
Comes down for the slaughter
And our young god Freyr,
He has no weapon in his hands
Charge Jotun, come Surtr;
The Destroyer of the Lands

Onwards he charghes
no sword in his hands
Righteous fury driving the stag
Freyr you know
your time is at hand
Slain by the blackened Jotun's 
Hand"Eminent winter"

the winter has came again
freezing my beloved fatherland
valleys fall asleep wrapped in snow and grey mist cold
woods are singing with howling winds of sorrow

Slavic soil , now an frozen majesty
nature sleeps , but warriors guard their realm
bathed in wonderfull snowfall
embraced by the cold of the decembermoon

great mountains as glacial palaces rising towards the sky
howling of wolves in grimness of dark can be heard
raven dance within cyclones of malevolance
and barbaric red holocaustclouds storms skyline

above
Slavic soil , now an frozen majesty
where
nature sleeps , but warriors still guard their realm
eternaly
bathed in wonderfull snowfall
still
embraced by the cold of the decembermoon
forevermore
my world will sleep in arms 
of dim and cruel eminent winterIn the nights black heart
and storms of winter.
We ride to Badbury rings,
to fight or die

with blood etched on our  blades
and the pain of "spears"
under dragons billowing wings
to fight or die

The ancient  tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one
The ancient  tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one

With  the hornbearers call  and the sound of ripping mail
the gods give us the joy to kill and kill again
this vile sweet stench of  the  battles clodded earth
a dreadful waring gale, of  reeking rusted glaive
of mongrel Saxon dead, and  bloody faces stained
of broken shield walls and broken mighty oaths
hewed battle shields and shivered ashen spears
and the horror of disgrace that cowards must embrace
is there's  for evermore,  a curse of their fallen race.

The ancient  tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one
The ancient  tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one
The Ancient Tribes are as one
our age has just begun
now let it be done, the will of the gods be done.Until now, I thought I knew what pain was
My head feels heavy in my hands
I'm searching for an answer
I'm searching for a way to understand

Why do I suffocate? Why do I drown in hate?
Am I standing on the edge of a precipice

Drowned by vast oceans, life consumes my lungs
Crowned king of nothing, I rip out my tongue
A soul now lay, destroyed
Stripped of worth, I let this take over me

Why do I suffocate? Its my own thoughts I hate?
Am I standing on the edge of a precipice

Defeated, this is the end
Hopeless, I feel myself bend
Defeated, this is the end
Hopeless, I feel myself bend

Infected
We walk alone
Defeated
With hearts of stone

Constricted
Breathing slows
Defeated
Our purpose gone

Malevolent Victory

Defeated, this is the end
Hopeless, I feel myself bend
Defeated, this is the end
Hopeless, I feel myself bend

Hopeless, I will break unto death take me
Defeated, my eyes no longer see
There is no way out
My mouth moves, but I cannot shoutIn their lands they march in steel and glitter
P'on their scales and silk the sun lies golden
Under moon we wear the hide of wolves
In our hearts are the kings that beat the primal drum

In their lands they ride brown steeds so gallant
On their shields beset with sparkling jewels
Down below we fight with foot in the dirt
In our hearts are kings that sound the ancient horn

In their lands
Lions lay counting their treasure
Every knight, crowned with golden crests
In the fens we race the heathen stallions
For our hearts hold the riches of the highest towers

The men of the East are decked in steel
They march with a trumpet's din
They glitter with silks and golden scales
And high kings boast their kin
We of the West wear the hides of wolves
But our hearts are steel within

They of the East ride gallent steeds
Their spears are long and brown
Their sheilds are set with sparkling stones
And each knight wears a crown
We fight on foot as out forebears fought
And we drag the rider down

We race the steed of the Saxon knight
Across the naked fen
They of the East are full of pride
Cubs of the Lion's den
They boast they breed a race of kings
But we of the West breed Men(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hul het hemelse koninkrijk in een zee van zwarte vlammen,
onttroon de bastaard Christus
Laat de ware goden zetelen op de tronen van ons land
Eens weer prevaleert het heidens hart

Godslaster de heilige geest, martel Gods boden met vuur
Breng Judea tot vallen, Zion verbrand!
Vernietig elke kathedraal, kapel en kerk!
Bespaar geen bijbel ons heidens vuur!
Nooit meer vals moraal en nimmer meer onechte waarde, 
met goden aan mijn zijde verdoem ik al 't Christelijk leven

Verdoem al 't Christelijk leven
Schenk ons domein haar waardigheid
Verdoem al 't Christelijk leven
Spaar geen ziel in deze strijd

Wreed gemarteld en gepijnigd, onthoofd of gespietst,
geen genade of erbarmen voor de schande die ze zijn!
Uit het as van verbrande iconen en Christen lijken zullen onze geesten worden herboren!
Verdoem al 't Christelijk leven!


Draugluin / Hrodwitnir '97(Instrumental)One of us, one of the lost, skies did condone
Soul renowned, blaze splendour unbound
Shed sun on atoned, wield rays profound
For us, for the lost, reach beneath hallow ground

Forsaken, far reaching
Shades you cast forth
Awaken, had dawn undone
What night did wrought

Gallows wreath, barrow leaves, laid at broken feet
Lead us, give us path, bourne oblivion heeds
Shadows claim, behind the flames, ripe rewards reaped
For us, for lost, forever shall recede

You were, you are, one of us
And shall be, for eternity
One of the lostHorses raging eyes as wide as night
There mouths now foaming the enemy's now in sight
Blood boiling and flowing through their veins
There masters now charge on clutching at the reigns

With our swords at our sides
Into glory we shall ride
Are hearts aren't full of fear but pride
With our banners held high
Reaching for the sky
We charge onwards knowing soon we may all die

 But if this is to be, then we still believe
Our days aren't numbered because we have believed
That well meet in the sky in the great hall up high
Where past great warriors' souls shall eternally lie

In this Asgard the gods are there to see
Halls of gold & riches beckon me
Final showdown the age of Ragnarok
I show no fear as I stand with the one eyed godOh! Gaia, great goddess who gives life to
Everything that lives and grows on the infinite body.
Embrace the boundless areas.
In other long forgotten worships.
They call for thee by the inexpressible names.
And also inexpressible is the name of the mountain.
They were the priests carrying torches
To invoke the speaking words that the
Human minds cannot comprehend.

Gaia, all mighty goddess

In your endless body the gave birth to the tartars.
The dreadful tartars.
There were no life exists but only shadows.
The shadows of the past.
Thou mingled with the universe and gave birth to fearful gods.
Oh! Great mother I call thee.
Saw me the ancient secrets.
Give me the universe's being.
Give me eternal life.
Give me the knowledge of the black arts.

Oh! Gaia.We the sons of the Morningstar
Sing the words of honour and devotion
Through highlands and eternal moors
For the might of our northern realmThe mass is over the night is done
Time to reap our rewards
The stench is sweet the burning lust
Brought forth by our Lord
Heat is rising souls are dying
By Lucifer's sword
Ride to hell your Lord has fell
Ride to Hell... on the wings of Satan
Now I am free from mortal chains
Forever living in sin
Taking chances with destiny
The only way you'll win
Mayhem, torture, darkness and pain
Let the Holocaust beginBlack, deep, darkness. Engulfed in a pit. Surrounded by the unknown. Wishing for a solution. Reaching out in to the dark. Nothing. Pain, deception, and hate. Engulfed in a pit. Surrounded by the familiar. Looking to the past. Searching for the truth. Nothing. Power, influence, strength. Empowered by Odin. Destroying those who oppose. Wishing for a test. Seeking an opposition. No one. Death. decay, silence. The end of life. Power enhanced further. Looking to the future. Reaching out to the stars. Nothing.(Instrumental)Narrowed down the voices in my head
To those who speak in silence
'Cause all the others loudly shouting out
Resorts in utter violence

Feels like a storm is gathering inside my chest
Because of all your silence
How can you do what you have done
With sich a childlike innocence?

Seems like it's just me who never knew
What you were hiding
So what am I to do with all those hopes
Life seems so very frightening

Feels like I'm draining myself inside
Oblivious and silent
shuffling feet come slowly towards me
Deadly and defiantKneel down from the whispers of the demon

Within the flames searching deeper in this force, incense of madness and lust
Drawn, so close, to the gates, your streaming possessively shivers

Overwhelming your senses, you're suffering the teeth clinching rage
Born of demon, fear

Revile for me the lusts, fall for the gates of Satan

For the man, there has never been nothing
Still bowing through the winds of dust
Forever in time shall their knees face the flames
Awaiting the collectors of the king

Revile for me the lusts, fall for the gates, set you in the trance

Rites upon the man
Forever doomed to serve, reaching in for the flesh and lost
Bowing your heads for no mercy

For the man, there has never been nothing
Still bowing through the winds of dust
Forever in time shall their knees face the flames
Awaiting the collectors of the king

Forever they serve in honor of the one, so merciless upon the slaves of the light
Forth from the mist, serve the might of SatanThe Investigation: Chapter 3 of "Chikatilo"

[written by Marc]

- November 2000 -

Part I: The madmen-gang

Four years and fourteen murders later

Central militia sent out their best major.

Criticising the ineptitude of local police

Attributing slaughters to a sex-crazed killer.

A special task force was convoked

The Division of Especially Serious Crimes

Lead by an experienced forensic analyst.

The case known as Forest Strip Killings.

Believing the murderer was abnormal

Looking for crimes involving sex and violence

Searching through records of mental hospitals,

The task was long and arduous.

Samples of semen taken from the victims

Indicated the perpetrator has type AB blood.

Police picked up a man acting suspiciously,

Obviously retarded, he confessed the murders

Committed with his madmen-friends.

As the killings continued, the boys were released.

Part II: The man with the glasses

One year and fifteen new homicides later

Investigation failed to uncover any evidence.

Psychologists, pathologists were asked for advise.

To provide a profile of the slashing maniac.

Suffering from chronic sexual inadequacy,

Brutalising his victims for compensation.

Patrolling bus, tram and train stations,

A middle-aged man wearing thick glasses,

Paying particular attention to young girls.

Observed and approached by an inspector,

Finding the papers were in order,

Uneasy feeling this man's hiding something.A abyss root crawls upon the earth
A speakless creature silence the night
As daylight fades the strenght is mine
Let darkness came - let the night be spawned
I summon the wind - to be my guide
I call upon the earth - it will be my soul
I drink the water - my blood it shall be
I burn with fire - rape this human world
From ash to fire - from dust to bone
From corpse to flesh - from death to life
The cursed soul shall find their way
Thru bones in the dirt, wormeaten carcass
The abyss root forms the bloodline of evil
Unseen, unheared, unspoken : the silence hymns from hell
The taste of death, blood, vomit and gore
The taste of your flesh, six feet below
Immolation of decomposed bodyTo the Eternal Victory May the Wolves hunt again Spiteful Influence
Covers archane armies Going to fall into Dementia Abyss
Chaos devise I inherited the Emptyness benath it
Ranks of Uranus Inclined to divide the Empire
Woe betide To the Beaten Throne of Demise Reigns dance over it!
Powers and Storms leave a bloody Scent
Darkness I evoke in the name of my Creed
Hierachy and Cult enchain the Weak
Astral Summoning Draw up the Beast!
The Gates of the Moon Open wide to demons Cyclopic Ruins shine
In the rotten shields
Chaos devise I inherited the Emptyness benath it
Ranks of Uranus Inclined to divide the Empire
Woe betide To the Beaten Throne of Demise Reigns dance over it!
WAR!
TO WAR!
WAR!
TO WAR!(Instrumental)When I roam through the wide of the woods
when I climb up the peak of a mountain
when I hark to the voice of the wind
when I yell in the freedom of wild land I feel strength!

When I walk in the rays of the sun
when I stand in the glow of the moonlight
when I grap in the soil of our earth
when I hold all my life in my own hands I feel strength!

Wind and storm
bolt and thunder
rain and hail
snow and ice
exposed to the forces of nature
I learn to part the truth from lies
exposed to the forces of nature
I yell in freedom my hailing cries: Hail!

Day and night
black and white
sun and moon
heat and cold
observing the rhythms of nature
I learn to speak the tongue of old
observing the rhythms of nature
I speak the words that I've been told: Hail!decades ago, a time now long gone
 death metal had it's pure form
 so easy then amongst global friends
 a bold scene never to conform
 changes set in, pollution begins
 despicable developments
 the duty to return and make all traitors burn
 on to your knees and repent

 deathhammer

 vocals so poor, like frogs in a moor
 guitars like clouds of fruit flies
 where's the bass sound, drums that don't pound
 hear how our iron church cries
 they don't give a fuck, just collecting bucks
 acting like statues on stage
 our final call to all those false
 we summon thou bastards to rage

 deathhammer

 writing the pages, lasting for ages
 restore purity that once was
 deathhammer bloodstained, death will die again
 this is our doctrine and cause
 chapters demanding, episodes ending
 delivering the death metal bill
 the years of the leech, finished as we preach
 if you won't face death we will

 deathhammerLong ago three men ruled,
Brothers from over the sea
Two earls died,
Leaving the land to one

An heir sailed across the sea
To claim his father's land

Rognvald received his rightful land and that which Einar ruled
For the promise of sword and spear against enemies

Raids in the south proved his worth, but friendship would not last

Arnason, escaping the king, fled to western land
With a large company, too many for one to feed.

More land was needed but Rognvald would not yield

Men were gathered from the isles and from the south
They would march for Thorfinn against his king
Rognvald sailed away and gained support from the king
Men would meet for war

Near the shore they met, a hundred ships covered the sea
The fighting was fierce, many were slain,
Rognvald forced to flee

On a winter's night Rognvald's men returned
Revenge was in their eyes
Thorfinn's house and company were burned
And all the land was claimed

[Spoken:]
Believed to be dead
Thorfinn stowed away to Caithness
Where he bided his time
Plotting his revenge.
Soon before Christmas he returned
And beset Rognvald and his men
By their campfire's light as they made their festive preparations

[Thorfinn:]
"My brother's son was betrayed by his words
Now is is I who returns
He lies slain, my vengeance is wrought.
I lay my claim that these lands are mine!"When Naglfar Sails

Brothers will start fighting with each other,
relatives will die in conflicts,
heavily in the world, great fornication,
century of swords and pole-axes, boards will burst
century of storms and wolves to death of the world

When Naglfar sails,
Like a huge evil shadow,
Reflected by the light of the moon,
Horribly enterns the shadow-fjords

When Naglfar sails,
From the kingdom of the dead
When Naglfar sails
Time of the twilight of the gods comes

Naglfar, ship made from
The fingernails and toenails of the dead
After three years of winter
Slides by the frozen sea

Army of Jotuns, conducted by Loki
Float on it to Vigrd,
The last battlefield for battle
With the gods

When Naglfar sails,
Like a huge evil shadow,
Reflected by the light of the moon,
Horribly enterns the shadow-fjords

When Naglfar sails,
From the kingdom of the dead
When Naglfar sails
Time of the twilight of the gods comes

Its sail fluttering on a wind is angry and black
Its boards are wide and sharp, like a razor edge
They crash into a flesh of Jehovah
And rotten flesh of the world which is eager for healing and renewal

Now time has come
For Surtr and his fiery sword
To burn out by red-hot iron an ugly ulcer
On a body of a frail world

Great gods and a blossoming tree of life
Nowadays are only shadows of itself
Poisoned by venom of treachery and cowardice
Of blind masses turned to the new god

I summon you!
Chtonic forces of nature
Fiery giants of Muspellheym
And descendants of ice giants from Jotunheim

Let the fire and water, the earth and the sky
Merge in a united furious rush
Let anger of pristine nature by united sweeping wave hit

Expiring ugly world
And bring it to renewal
Through the destruction and violence of the elements

Hrym steers from the east, waters rise,
the mundane snake is coiled in jotun-rage
The worm beats the water, and the eagle screams
The pale of beak tears carcasses, Naglfar is loosed

That ship fares from the east
come will Muspell's people over the sea, and Loki steers
The monster's kin goes all with the wolf
with them the brother of Byleist on their course

When Naglfar sails,
Like a huge evil shadow,
Reflected by the light of the moon,
Horribly enterns the shadow-fjords

When Naglfar sails,
From the kingdom of the dead
When Naglfar sails
Time of the twilight of the gods comes

The sun grew dim,
The earth sinks in the sea,
Light stars break from the sky,
The flame storms a life feeder,
Heat intolerable reaches the skyTranscended beauty 
Blossoms into mist 
On purest will shines 
The effigy of demise 

A timeless face of bereavement 
Embellishes this solid stone 
Conceals the ever unresting 
Our reason for life and doom 

The majesty of loss 
Is inherent to existence... 

And this sorrow-stricken world 
Shall be our putrid grave 
For mostly it is loss which teaches 
Us about the worth of things 

A self-denying prophecy 
With tremendous cost of reason 
Forfeit all aimless efforts 
Embrace the scent of defeat 
Swallow all sense of elation 
Surrender to the omnipresent 
Majesty of loss...Not a single voice
Only croaking of hired toadies
So you have no choice
Just to listen to endless eulogies

"You should be grateful" they say
"For our charity,
We we've brought you these happy days
Of prosperity,
And if you know any disgruntled
Just say the names,
The ungrateful will be punished!"

Do you feel this weight?
Jeer is bending you to the ground
And implicit hate is
Gnawing you and all around.

"We can't breathe!
Don't bring it to grief!"

Can you hear the insulated cries of desperation
In the rare times of calm?

"We can't breathe!
Don't bring it to grief"

Do you share this cruel irresistible temptation?
What about to crash it all!

Do you smell the blood?
Do you smell the blood yeah
Of your brothers who died in ignorance of what goes on
Now they bleed

The unnameable gods,
The unnameable gods yeah
Hold your mind captive in the weakening drowse
For their needs

If you're sick and tired of this somnolence
Will you find a comfort in violence
And bitter revenge?

Cast away their sops, break out form the stall, 
Form the battle line, time to crash them all
A perfect exchange

Have you ever thought, 
Have you ever thought yeah
Can the creatures like that ones exist on the earth
But they live

If they feel a threat,
If they feel a threat yeah
They will promise anything you want to pay off
Don't believe.

See the palace of the black sorcerers
Guarded by the legions of murderers
They're eager to fight

Brothers, are you willing to pit your skill
'gainst the impudents, who were coached to kill
The unholy might

Sudden impact when
We almost won
This is not blood, 
Just splashes of the Sun

Victory was near
But we met a defeat
We held out against the power and cruelty
Not against the guile

They will make you suffer
But they still need you
As a vampire needs a victim's blood for his life
They won't let you die

So go back again to your prison cell
Hide into the sleep from the morbid spell
Until the next time.A moonlight force
A moonlight slavery

By the shadow gods

a tale of heroes and fights
darkness and holy lightSvit upada v noc			
ked svetlo opusta zrak	
zlom nastal momentom
instinkt sprevadza lesny hlas.

Tam kde nadych nepolavi
zrak zaplneny hladom
valiac sa prud krvilacny
moje zily stuhli ladom.

Casova put prazdnotou
slaby vykrik prekryty hmlou
V stopach jasny osud tmy
pach tienom zahuby.

Brodiac riekou, nastrahou
moja piesen svetlom i tmou
rev volnosti v kriku sipa
bez vanku vetra, mesiaca.

Kralovstvom
putom i snom
zijuci hmlou
nocnou oblohou...Flames of power burn in my eyes
Pagan fires inflame my valiant soul
Fever of conquest will guide my blade
For destruction in a blast of fury

Deep in my heart pounds the will for victory

Under black skies, in fields of blood
Reign the fires of revenge and rage
Anger is my bride in this warfare
No prisoners but a smell of dying

Deep in my heart pounds the will for victory

Wrecking, raging fights
Slaying and raping in rapture
Power striking down in a thrashing might

Flames of power burn in my eyes
Pagan fires inflame my valiant soul
Fever of conquest will guide my blade
For destruction in a blast of fury

Deep in my heart pounds the will for victory
And in battle, son of fire shall prevailLike the sea that battles with the soaring cliffs
A sentinel to those that once have fallen here
As the river filled with frost and autumn glow
Bring my spirit to this island fight me no more
With the mist I'll travel and the sun will die
Form the bridge of forest so that I might fly
Take my legions far across the fedland throne
Let me rest in where my gift of sorrow comes
The sun is slowly overwhelming the sorrow
That came with the moon and there cries
No longer can be heard or taken away
By the wind that roams now this island
And the sorrowful shores
I scent the presence of the dying day
Rivers that call my name
I drink of the water
Gone, forgoten and dead
Now the new day dawns here
Our sun is gone thousands years ago
Those glorious shores are awaiting still asleep
I am afraid of such oblivion
I`m torchured by these wisions
and the winter of war
my spirit will remain lost
for i will allways feel this place sorrow

O great sea that never end and always returns

Make them rest and make their Pride and customs never forgotten

Keep hold of their swords preserve the times long gone 

Keep their spirits away from the snow and the forest away from the eternity in winter and hunger

Embrace them and caress them when raging on this shores

Crown them as the graves of the oceansBehold the waves 
 where do they come from? 
 Do not hesitate. 
 If the distance is long 

 Run, 
 You may loose, 
 or maybe win. 
 Who cares? 

 It is a decision. 
 To chase away the doubts. 
 Sail the ocean 
 of supreme pleasure. 

 Run, 
 You may loose, 
 or maybe win. 
 Who cares? 

 Waves of oblivion 
 ride the ocean's breeze. 
 Gain fortitude 
 For the journey just begun. 

 I must go now. 
 Got tired of stillness. 
 A wave maybe, 
 bring us close again. 

 A wave maybe, 
 bring us close again.When the Sun is dancing
Rolling over Hills of Noone
Butterflies are lazy
Madness is what I discover
Distant sounds of strange ways
'T means the sunny days are over
Someone knows of my name
Universe of disorder

Curtain disappears
Doomsday show is going on
Something in my ears
Music of my narrow home
Twilight Sun is actor
Really great eternal hero
Happy end of this world
The end of show is near

Broken hearts are bleeding
They feel sorry for this story
Noone can't stop heeding
Hailing to the actor's glory
Twilight Sun is dancing
Rolling over Hills of Noone
Warriors of wasteland
Singing "world is over"

There is a home I live alone
The storming waters in my pond
Unbeaten tracks and endless road
Since the creation of the world
And I don't pine for if I die
And I don't pine for if I lie
No way to see the crown of skies
Because that fire in my eyes

And I don't pine for
If I go insane
And I don't pine for
If I were afraid
And I don't pine for
If you say hello
I'm only dreaming
I shouldn't care at allI soar with memory and thought
Over the darken skies of a frozen mind
To seek the light of my purity
Where I run with wolves
Bound to honour, loyalty, will and truth
I run through autumns crisp mourning breath
Over the moist green hills
Of my ancestors lands
To seek the lines of my people
Back to the beginning
I find mighty mountains of ice and snow
Where cracks in stone tell old forgotten law
I hear the winds chant their wild songs
Of tooth and claw
Circling the pillar of irminsul
I wonder 
The old wood forests of natures law
Beyond good and evil paths
To seek the wisdom of my roots
To call to the essence of aryan man
Father Odin hears my call.(Instrumental) 

	Shape shifting
Circling anticlockwise
Orange inferno

The field performed
Physical contact

Unexpected manifestation of death

Boredom sets in, my thoughts begin to roam
Seemingly endless this, my eternal toil
Rotting from the inside my mind starts to spoil

My thoughts grow slow and I drift towards sleep
Awake with a start as I've deadlines to keep
With renewed vigour I return to my task
But this enthusiasm just will not last

Tired of this life
What can I do
To refresh myself
And start anew
Enless repetition
More thankless tasks
Trying so hard just to
Fail at the last

The weekend comes and now I am free
Two out of of seven, these days they are for me
So much to do and so little time
Then freedom's done again it's back to the grindRecollections of dicey territories 
Where I dreamed myself away
I was only my consciousness and nothing else 
And in the mind of the sun they were all dicing with death

With pain they howled in the heart of the world
But screaming my lungs out there was nothing to hear
In the mind of the sun there was nowhere to hide and everything to fear

Wrapped by emptiness trapped in loneliness
Far beyond, they were all dancing on the shiny solar beam
As the new age was glently looming

Earth cracks, human veins
Scattered roots, glued fingers
Slowly growing like creeping snakes
And far beyond, they were all dicing with death

Feet in the dust, hands in the ash
With prayers and hopes some tried to make sense 
Of the unfathomable mystery 
Releasing the raven to search for the water land
They believed the future was here
Sucked out in the remaining salt 
From Yam Suph, no longer a water of hope

Wrapped by emptiness trapped in loneliness
Far beyond, they were all dancing o(Instrumental)Rain pours down
The final moment, the final breath to take
Awakening from (the deepest) thoughts
My heart pounds
But not by fear, but by hate

It is a new days dawn and the gods have
Brought the storm, their final blessing
Lightning strikes down upon
The enemy. Many of them are now dead
The moment has come
The sign has been given
Time of all the enemy to die
And the holy four winds are
Whispering: Thou are today vicorius...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)THE REBIRTH OF THE PAGAN PRIDE 


 
 

Now I see the mountains, 
The fullmoon shines over me, 
The ancient blood runs for this lands 
Those mystic places I adore. 

CHORUS: 
Take your axe and feel the wrath 
Of the ancient gods, 
Now the fire starts to burn 
The pagan pride is our again 
We got the fire!!! 

Through the frozen forest I walk 
The darkness fills the sky, the moon shines 
In the valleys begins the battle, 
We are gathered, ready for attack, 
Give us your power, to win the victory, 
The battle rages 

CHORUS 

Cosmic storms blow the lands, 
The eternity reigns in everywhere, 
Ancient legions awake again, 
Seeds of the pagan gods, 
Are ready to grow, 
And finally we have the triumph 

OUTRO: 
Send us to the eternity, 
The pagan ruins are rebuild, 
To reign forever.Man!
Inexorably you come to me
Each instant you're closer to me
I am death
Do you know where I'll lead you?
Are you sure
That your life will go on endlessly...
Endlessly?

Into misfortune
Into eternal pain

Man!
You're condemned to die
You're condemned to join me
And this certainty haunts you from your birth on
Me, your death, I tell you
Man, you cannot withstand
Man, you're trapped
Man, you must choose
You've chosen
I'll lead you
Close to the lord of the dark powers

No rest

No end
No shelter

No escape
No respite
No sleep

No dreams... eternally...(Instrumental)...and thus they were come to a great fortress standing on an open plain. A fell yet mighty
air was about this place. They had at least reached Utgard, a stronghold of giants. Entering, 
they beheld a great hall. Inside, many large men sat in feast.

"News travels slowly from distant parts, but am I wrong in thinking that this little fellow is 
Thor the Charioteer? Surely there is more to you than meets the eye. Tell me, companions, 
in what skills do you think you are capable of competing? No one can stay here with us who
does not have some skill or knowledge greater than other men." 

"I, Loki, will challenge thee
I am the swiftest eater here
Bring forth a trough of meat
Now, who will face me?
Now in the middle I see
That I am defeated
Though bones remain after me
Nothing I see in front of me."

"Come, now, Thjalfi,
Let us race
Out on the plain
Of Utgard.
Three times I won
Now turn back
And accept defeat
At Utgard."

"Bring forth the feasting horn
From which the Charioteer will drink.
I know you can drain this horn in
Three drinks and no more.
Should you fail, I shall not doubt that
You will fare well in other feats."

"I cannot lift your cat,
Though I try with all my might
I cannot wrestle your old nurse
So steadfast is her stance."

In truth, I am the forest giant
You struck mountains with your blows
Wildfire burned and mind did run
Thus came defeat to your friends
Though you drank you did not see
The ocean unending
The Serpent you lifted high
And old age you did fight wellMounted men in their horses holding torches
Murdering men and women
Burning villages, enslaving lives

Destroying clans
The only thing that mattered from
The enigma of the steel

Children seeing their parents dying
Leading them only grief
Abandoned in a world of broken hope

The hate runs in their veins
Revenge is their legacy

The only thing that mattered
Was the enigma of the steel

Enigma of the steel(Corkhill, Trad. Scots)

Will speak of a lord among earls
Baron of barons, Athelstan king
My kinsmen and I fought by this side;
The man of who they now sing
Bestower of ring, in battle famed
We vowed our services to stand,
When from the north his enemy came
To defend his ancient land

Hewed the lindenwood, hacked the battle shield
Sons with hammered brands
A greatness bestowed from their fathers before
Struck for their hoards and their hearths and their homes

Bow'd the spoiler, bent the Scotsman
Felled the ship crews doomed to death
All the field flowed with the blood of men
Struck for their hoards and their hearths and their homes

There lay many a man marred by the javelin,
Men of the Northland shot over shield
There was the Scotsman weary of war
Struck for their hoards and their hearths and their homes
Turned the invader for country and throne!

Northman and Saxon, side by side
The day to fall or prevail
Fate of these lands, now to decide
To be told of in song and in tale
Many men fell by sword and spear
Fiercely we fought, never to yield
All men saw the earl die on that day
The Scotsmen fled the field

Come the light of dawn
Clatter of mail heralds one more
As I had foreseen, the day I would rue
As my brother lay slain on the floor

Five young kings slept by sword
Numberless men fell dead
Grimly, with steel sharp from the stone
All were slain who fledShadow after insanity
Stay serene and nostalgic of your past
Forget what it push you here
If a change appear, your memory will revive
Use your reason to guid your paces
You're a human being, try to act like this
Agaist a dilemma, give way to your mind
Use your privilege, don't make sacrilege
Show them your greatness
And what it will do of you their master
Act in the nature order
You are your persecutor(Instrumental)A thousand years of slavery, coming to an end, and the wars created, destroyed so many men. All those lives lost, in the name of Jesus Christ, believing in blind faith, they made their sacrifice. Destroying cultures or anything pure in it's path, follow the church or you'd face it's wrath. On blood and flesh, your empire was built, for the genocide of nations, fess up to your guilt. 

SINNERS REPENT... BOW BEFORE ME!!! YOUR SAVIOR IS NEAR... BOW BEFORE ME!!! GIVE UP YOUR SOUL... BOW BEFORE ME!!! THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR... BOW BEFORE ME!!! 


The forces of nature takes it's course, pride topples guilt, with no remorse. Myth of the century is proven wrong, might masters right, the weak don't belong. Pride and hatred go hand in hand, For centuries of preaching your hate, once again, the lion's den awaits your fate. 


Lions, whips, Judeo-Christians, ...LET THE SPECTACLE BEGIN!!! Lions, whips, Judeo-Christians, ...CHEERING ON AS THE COLOSEUM FILLS!!! Lions, whips, Judeo-Christians, ...CENTURIONS FLOGGING YOUR BODIES SORE!!! Lions, whips, Judeo-Christians, ...CAN YOU HEAR THE MIGHTY LIONS ROAR!!! 


Claiming to be messengers of peace, but there are so many child molesting priests. Acts of perversions have gone untold, how many lies are bought and sold? Blind lead the blind in search of faith, only feeling guilt with no pride in their race. Who gets saved when their walls tumble down, tell me where the fuck is your messiah now. 


WE ARE ALL EQUAL... BOW BEFORE ME!!! IN THE EYES OF HIS GRACE... BOW BEFORE ME!!! HE IS COLORBLIND... BOW BEFORE ME!!! HE DOESN'T SEE RACE... BOW BEFORE ME!!! 


Lions, whips, Judeo-Christians, ...LET THE SPECTACLE BEGIN!!! Lions, whips, Judeo-Christians, ...CHEERING ON AS THE COLOSEUM FILLS!!!

(music: Rhaa, Nathuruss, lyrics: Vidar)

In the past, the shadows cannot fly,
So watch the life, it is passing you by,
In the walls you are those missing bricks,
Join me, we shall swim in Styx

In the depths of Styx...
where the sorrow drowns its tears,
In the depths of Styx...
Where you're free of any fears.

It welcomes you...
For dark my visions seem, the moon whispers to me,
It awaits you...
This time you're blind to see (that) time has come for thee,
In conceals you...
So called God wants thee dead, drowned in thy own tears,
It betrays you, my friend...
On the journey into Darkness, thy weakness is thy company.

Those dark waters flow, Despair, and thou such hopeless,
Stream takes thee away, the Truth, has lost its meaning,
Voices from the dead side, the Pain, those tears are senseless,
Shores appear dark, Struggle, for those who've never seen...

The stream of blackness heals your dying soul,
In your boat you're losing control,
Each soul a drop in the dead ocean,
Flowing the fields without emotion...Fell land 
In seasons pass I wander the cascade 
lost in the wake of Mabon 
now ripen the lakes, to the tarns we ride 
auburn eye in silence 

lost in reveries.... 
gripping sward cold 

vengeance under bloody skies 
to perdition we ride 

charge the slaughter 
cast the blows with pride 
on this horse until thou meets thy fate 
ride the storm this night 

severed lives within a blinded eye 
bodies forced into the ground 
treachery formed against the crown of our realm 
now the time has come to fight 

Thunder calls 
guiding chaos light 
returning the battle cry 
in certainty of mine fate 

With heart of stone 
and head of hate 
soul condemned with the blackest of marks 
we behold 
cowards and traitors 
condemned to die...Der stille Schrei

...wenn sich die Dunkelheit ueber die Daecher legt
und es mich wieder, weit weg von euch, in die Waelder zieht.
Hinaus in die monotone Abgeschiedenheit.

Von Waeldern und Bergen umgeben.
Still stehend.
Sinnend im Wald.
Ruhig blutend.
Zufriedenheit, welche in meinem Herzen widerhallt.

Ein stiller Aufruf tief im Herz...
Nur die Wunden meines Koerpers geben ihn preis.
Doch ruhig wird er bleiben.
Der stille Schrei meiner Seele. So ist es, wird es immer sein.

Ihr koennt ihn nicht hoeren, werdet ihn nie verstehen.
Hier bin nur ich und die Einsamkeit.
Doch...Demonic winds hail over this land
Ruins of evil forces forgotten in ashes
A dark shade covers the Fortress
Time of old ceremonies

Lurking through the halls of blood
Shadows everywhere... 
Somber is my mind
Lost in a dimension of shattered dreams!

A ceremony of vampiric lust...

In the darkest autumn night..
I spill the blood in possession 
Stain the blade for the ritual
Haunt in demonic depression

Lurking through the halls of blood
Shadows everywhere... 
Somber is my mind
Lost in a dimension of shattered dreams!

Ancient Fortress of Vampirism!
Ancient Fortress of Vampirism!

Lurking through the halls of blood
Shadows everywhere... 
Somber is my mind
Lost in a dimension of shattered dreams!

Black is my heart..
Obscurity in my soul
Searching for the lost dreams
Of a new worldLIVING IN THE SHADOWS, HIDING IN THE CRYPTS
EXILED AND FORSAKEN, FOR EVIL TO BE PLEAD
THE PERVERT, THE ARROGANT, THE ONE THE PEOPLE GIBE
LET HIM BE THE CHOSEN, DECIDE THE WAY THEY DIE

THE MADMAN LAUGHS AT YOU... 
FATAL HIS WORDS, HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH...

NOW HE IS ABLE, A LORD OF DEATH
HE SOLD HIS SOUL, BLESSED OR POSSESSED?
BLASPHEMIC CALLING, HE'S THE SOLEMN ONE
CHANTING THE RITES OF EVIL, RISE AT ONCE

ENTHRONE THE INSANE

HUNT ALL THE CRISTIANS, THEIR SOULS TO HAUNT
SLAUGHTER THEIR BODIES, CURSING THEIR GOD
PAGAN AUTHORITY, CORRUPTED AND INSANE
HIS BRUTAL MAJESTY, HIS KINGDOM OF PAIN

ENTHRONE THE INSANECALL OF LUCIFER

Take me from this infernal life
Give me your immortality
Take me from your precious sins
Fill me with your obscurity
Take me from this embraced life
Give me your immorality
Take me in your infernal wings
Fill me with your obscenity

Lucifer
Feel my sorrow
Lucifer
Be my guide

Save me from this pleasant night
Give me your dark legacy
Save me from your stoled mind
Fill me with your impurity
Take me from this soulless life
Give me your dark ecstacy
Take me in your darker paths
Fill me with your insanity

Lucifer
Feel my sorrow
Lucifer
Be my guide


Lyrics by Mortem & Asteroth

Music by Mortem & AsterothAS THE HOWL OF THE WOLVES

A tale from the past at a winternight
When the howl of the wolves
Were heard beyond the horizon
A saga will start

At the infinite hills
With my honor, sword and shield
The final battle will arise

As the howl of the wolves
THey announce the battle
As the howl of the wolves
Echoing inside of me 
As the howl of the wolves
In the winterstorm
As the howl of the wolves
Tribute to my ancient pride

Hears the howl around the hills
HEars the symphony made by steel
HEars the voices
Calling me for the battle
HEars the ancestral wind
Blowing beyond the castle

I hear my ancestors 
Calling me for war
All they in one strong voices 
Awaiting the moment for my final trip
By the last howl of the wolf
We will soon meet
In the land of infinity and destiny
And let the saga begins...Locked in a cell of the body searching for door
[but stumbling on walls]
Like lonesome stranger I roam longing for light
[in labyrinth of senses] 
Mind burden by the body cannot soar 
Tears like poison of snake killing the sight 
Like lonesome stranger I roam searching for door 
Soul in despair beats on the shell shaking the walls 
Walls of my prison from which falling down 
Spiders of fear building their nests all around

I feel as madness catches my brain
Using to cell
I know it my new home forever

Embrace me caress me
With thousands hairy paws
Caress me embrace me
With hundreds sticky bodies

Swinging on waves of the bliss granted by pain 
Yearning to break away was just in vain 
She won't give me in wrong to the outer world 
Nothing compares to eternity, or to her

I feel as madness catches my brain
Using to cell
I know it my new home forever

Embrace me caress me
With thousands hairy paws
Caress me embrace me
With hundreds sticky bodies

What for the light if night is fine 
She whispers me her lullabies 
What for the light if night is fine 
She hypnotizes with her eyes

And I fly forth through the labyrinths where I
Learned love and hatred, pain and joy
There where the voices calling me on
There where someone awaits for me for so long(Instrumental)The melancholy comes with me
My heart just keeps on crying
Crying tears of blood
In my heart...

I remember everything
Her eyes, her mouth, her scent
A silence on the air
I remember melancholy
Her trembling body
And her empty hands

The clock continues its course

I never knew why,
Why you take her away

Everyday is endless
My tears are sorrow
I won't be without you
Tears of blood in my heart

I'm alone in my room
Listening to this song
Trying to forget you

I remember that day
You told me a pact of love
Will close our love

My only one love,
I want to see you again
To be together
And never fall apartDevouring flame, womb of the ages
We are vessels of thy reflection
We are but dust in thy woven hands

Tidal spawns of perpetualness
Forged by continuity

The aim of all bleakest misery
Is to embrace the sanctity of being
The aim of all bleakest misery
Is to embrace the negativity of being

Tidal spawns of perpetualness
Forged by continuity
And given to disarray

Desire, sin, reluctance, discomfort
Entangled by thee we are swept onwards

Tidal spawns of perpetualness
Forged by continuity
And given to disarray

Devouring flame, womb of the ages...In the name of peace I've come to this land, but instead I have killed the innocent
This could not be explained again, reproaches remain in my mind, how long?
A stranger's body lying on the ground, I see my fate all around me
I still haven't found what I'm looking for, only children's eyes full of tears

Where His angels cry, people keep asking why
A drop of blood was shed, our hope is dead
In these men I see the future in the past
You are all I need but my heart is crying

I'm afraid of life like never before
In the silence I hear screams in pain
Waiting for an attack of the enemy
I don't know if I want to survive

Where His angels cry, people keep asking why
A drop of blood was shed, our hope is dead
In these men I see the future in the past
You are all I need but my heart is crying

No more cry. He sees your fate, have you ever been in the land of the lost?
No more tears for future past
I am in the war again...
In war...

No, I am not the same anymore, shadows of me in the night
I try to find meanings of things, for questions there is no time
Heaven is falling, the ruins of the human heart
On a page in the book of the dead is my name...and I will die

I will pray to God for eternity
Please forgive me and wash sins away
We are really part of the game of the gods
They are greedy for power and fame

Where His angels cry, people keep asking why
A drop of blood was shed, our hope is dead
In these men I see the future in the past
You are all I need but my heart is crying
I'm crying...

Have you seen the stars when they are rising?
This world must die
Have you ever seen sun on the horizon?
This world must die
Have you ever seen the stars when they are rising?
This world must die
Have you ever seen sun on the horizon?
This world must dieWhen all my blood mixes up with wine,
Like you and me when we combine
My heart quickens up it's pace
When i remember the smile on your face
The way to bless you it's hard to find
I've got you always on my mind
How can life become absurd?
If love begins to hurt

"Tell me why
I'd rather die
Tell me why
I can't deny"

Tell me why I'd rather die
Then live without you?

Tell me why I can't deny
I'm still longing for you?

I'm drowning in sadness
The feeling is bad
I'm caught in madness
It makes me sad
I can't get out of darkness
It drives me mad
I'm stuck in there helpless
I've lost all I've had!

Tell me why I'd rather die
Then suffer every day?

Tell me why I can't deny
That you have gone away?

When all my blood mixes up with wine,
It hurts to know that you were mine
Girl like you there won't be another one
it grieves me to face it that you are gone
A wounded heart is hard to heal
Life without you is tough to deal
When all my blood mingles up with wine
It aches my sould you aren't mineComplete paranoia surrounds you
Are you terrified?
Are you afraid of dark shadows?
Are you afraid of me?

Who do you really wanna be?
Aren't you my copy?
Who do you fear at night?
You feel that something isn't allright
But you don't really know where to find me

Are you afraid of living in darkness?
Aren't you?
What do you fear at night?
Never walk alone in the streets
Uncertain what you can see there

When you see it in the shadows
What do you feel?
Why do you fear at night?
You can see it's frightening face
Don't you know that's your own?

That face which looks at you from the mirror is mine
That eyes which are staring at you everyday are mine
That mouth which is speaking all those words is mine
That hands which...are mine
They are just mine! 

I'm just still living inside your mad mind
I'll be your shadow everywhere you can go
I'll be your nightmare which you're afraid of
I'm just a part of your sick imagination

Are you sure that words you hear are yours?
Are you sure that your mouth speaks words you wanna say?
Are you sure that your eyes see what is real?
Don't you know that you just belong to me?

I'm just still living inside your mad mind
I'll be your shadow everywhere you can go
I'll be your nightmare which you're afraid of
I'm just a part of your sick imagination

You're living shadow
Lack of life

I'm your nightmare, I'm your fear
Let your body disappear
I'm your blood, I'm your pain
Let your body feed again
I'm your future death
I'm your passed life
Let your body be alive, let your body be mine!

I'm your nightmare what do you feel
Thinking the way I think?
I'm your fate what do you see 
Looking in mirror and see my face?
I'm your best friend because
I'll never lat you down
I'm your worst enemy because
I'll easy sell you very cheap

Are you still thinking of me?
Are you afraid of what you see?Yes, It is a Dark Dream,
and coldful hatred hidden behind it...
I'm still dreaming,
i've been getting stronger,
because of this dream for centuries...
My nocturnal vision I realise in your world,
when the killes sun tries to hide...
We are still fighting gods are with us!
I'm Dreaming.
Dream about power of the white race,
Dream about superiority of the master on the icy thrones.
The Black Forest welcomes me
as a wolf hungry for the blood...
He welcomes me to dream in him
Weaves me up by the silver's moon dream.Nine old men grabbed 
Each other's wrists
To judge the herd
That wanted to destroy
The blessings of the wise
Ignoring the age
Of the nine old men
Seeker
Flaker
Breeder
Senser
Axe-thrower
Spirit-eyed
Vile-beholder
Bawler
Dead-watcher
Destroying in timebridges
Breaking their fate
Founding countries of stone tumulus

They left silencemirth
Crawled to branches
Far from the other
As man from yersterday
Marching
Backwards
Cleaving timebridge
For that other man
Would never to step ahead
Even a thought
Restraining pains of stepmothers
Only they know
When nine old men grab
Each other's wrists
They can rebuild all
That a waterman can see
Only from below
In the river,I looked myself in the eyes 
Perhaps a glance of misperception
the weary twilight in my soul 
I long for comforting words

I'm scared but I try to smile
repentant for all my sins
Will I ever be the same again? 

I'll wait to face the prison of my life
The remnant of old and painful memories
Imperceptible to come, yet so harmful to all
I taste love and hate
A blindfold for a clear insight

Incomprehensible delusions and denial 
I agonize my self-hatred
I reminisce the endless afterbirth
I fall on my knees
And surrender to my demise

I conceal myself right now
Just in case your darker half should try to get out
Is it all woth while?
'Cause near the end we all long to die...Thunder and lightning,
 The woods against sky
 Starlit cold waters
 Reflect in blue eyes
 
Scarlet the sunset,
 Pure is our blood
 Baptized shores
 Await us afar...
 
Hailed be the Panzer,
 Old Faith of Hammer
 By Fires and Murder
 White Thunder Roars
 
Burn their temples
 Burn to the ground
 Allfather of battle
 Calls us for War
 
Plunder and Pillage
 Triumph and Conquest
 Power and Wisdom
 The Will of Our Kind
 
Hailed be the Panzer
 Old Faith of Hammer
 By Fires and Murder
 White Thunder Roars
 
White Devils of Glory
 The swords against sky
 Red be the mornings
 By the Blood of the Sons
 
While twilight comes brown
 White is the colour
 The only one colour
 I'll paint the Night
 
Hailed be the Panzer,
 Old Faith of Hammer
 By Fires and Murder
 White Thunder Roars
 
Eternity calls Us
 By the voice of Our Blood
 The legends still live on
 By the Faith of the Sons
 
Mad is our century
 Yet We still believe
 Death or Valhalla
 Our Weapons and Dreams
 
Hailed be the Panzer,
 Old Faith of Hammer
 In the days of Ragnarok
 White Thunder Roars(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Before the gates of Annwn
Stands a noble man
Ruler of this kingdom
Chieftain of the silver tongue
The hunter and the hunted
The voice of wind through the trees
Neither human nor immortal
Lord of all he sees

Take me to the forest
Guide me to the light
See through the eyes of an eagle
Give me the gift of flight

A flame upon the threshhold
Lights the path of doom
There is no golden sunlight
There is no silver moon
The gods they speak of judgement
Dealt by the masters hand
Their destiny in shackles
Bitterly they sang

Take me to the forest
Guide me to the light
See through the eyes of an eagle
Give me the gift of flight

Take me to the forest
Guide me to the light
See through the eyes of an eagle
Give me the gift of flight

In the darkened days of winter
Slaves to the ice and snow
Before the gates of Annwn
They rise from the world below
Upon this soil most sacred
Pallisades of Oak
A fortress lay unconquered
Our bardic words invoke

Take me to the forest
Guide me to the light
See through the eyes of an eagle
Give me the gift of flightI know my native mystery 
My mystery's my fate to fly up 
My fate to fly up liberty 
My liberty's my ways in sky 
Why call me back from Heaven? 
I am the raven bird of grief 
I am bird of grief the sorrowbringer 
Why call me back from Heaven? 
Black sorrowbringer misery 
I am misery the lament singer 
Why call me back from Heaven? 
I prayed my Gods to give me wings 
Give me wings to learn to fly 
There is the Heaven far away 
Far away from greed and lies 
Why call me back from Heaven? 
There is no evil in the sky 
In the sky there is no evil 
Why call me back from Heaven? 
See raven flies up liberty 
My liberty is when I'm flying 
Why call me back from Heaven? 
I fly(Instrumental)Far Away In The Forest Runs a Wolf
He Will Shatter The Lamb
Make The Chosen People Bleed
The Smell Of Death Walk At It Side

Walls are red and cellar blake
Little work I have to make
With a fishwife bent to

I open a door
What I See?  Another whore
with a grimy grinning brow
Let me play with you girl

-You scum!- I'm your tailor
Thread I brought and courteous'll make you
Stich to lip and stitch to other 
You are silent. Cheerful rather!
Stitch by stitch but tongue is out
Hey, you calf, don't cry so loud
Use the scissors -What you do?-
Never'll be foul-mouthed you

I enter the wake 
Walls are red and cellar blake
Little work I have to make
With a cutty bent to

I open a door
What I See?  Another whore
with a grimy grinning brow
Let me play with you girl

-Hey lad?- I'm your lover
With my stake will pierce your cover
Let me plant you on the edge
Let me touch your lips with sledge
Please bend down and lift your skirt
Do not move, it's just absurd
Use that grampus -What you do?-
Never'll be so gorgeous you

I enter the wake 
Walls are red and cellar blake
Little work I have to make
With a lady bent to

I open a door
What I See?  Another whore
with a grimy grinning brow
Let me play with you girl

-Oh sir!- I'm your saviour
So said I and torch I gave her
Hands are tight so I have missed
So with fire she was kissed
Put your little hand in mine
Let me wipe tears with bine
Use that grip vice -What you do?-
Never'll be too mincing you

I went off the wake
Far off now cellar blake
As the evening pass the day
Coming home with pleasure

Jolly hangman 
Jolly hangman
Jolly hangman
Toils all day(Instrumental)Women and children, their men at war, killed if they do not convert
Tricked and forced to follow a god from another land
These men from foreign shores forced upon us their ways
They built their churches on our sacred grounds and pissed upon our graves

We shall remain forever loyal to our gods up high
In Asgard they shall reign throughout
The great Nordic skies

We shall fight these men from afar with Odin at our sides
Thunder cracks from darkened skies, Thors anger shows tonight
In my hand an axe or sword, not some pompous book
Around my neck will always be a hammer, not the cross

We shall remain forever loyal to our gods up high
In Asgard they shall reign throughout
The great Nordic skies

We still fight on to this day to restore the great Norse way
It will be hard but we wont quit till we've removed this god of lies
Let us not forget our past, and stories of long time told
Remember the many fallen ho died in the battles of old

We shall remain forever loyal to our gods up high
In Asgard they shall reign throughout
The great Nordic Skies

Gods up high I'll always be forever Asatru
With sword in hand i go to war
In Valhalla I'll feast with youRidings the winds To the battle Swords drawn high Raised to the sky When you reach The field of demise Time stands still As you get your first kill Out of the forest Out of the trees The great ones arrive Ready to fight for their land The scent of blood and smoke fills the land all for a new ruler to take over the throne. All seems hopeless for you and your brothers This may be the end The thought of that tyrant ruling your land fuels your hate for the enemy Now all you care about is shedding the blood of the men in front of you The ruthless warrior in you will be unleashed The battle has ended You've done all that you could You raise your bloody sword to the sky as a sign of victory.The lush valleys of my sacred land
Vast lands washed by crystal clear waters
North shine the palaces of stone

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

The shadows of night brings memories...
Elders tell stories of achievements
Our wives and children toasting the bounty of our fields

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

I give my soul to the gods...
In return we pay them back with the spoils of war
I will give my life for my homeland
The blood enemy sow our green fields

Our hands are destroyed to handle swords
The torn flesh by the power of steel
The distant eyes reveal the horrors of war

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

The duty to love and defend our land
Will always be passed to generations to come
In harmony with the forces of the earth

The mother earth in perfect harmony with the mythical Gods

I give my soul to the gods...
In return we pay them back with the spoils of war
I will give my life for my homeland
The blood enemy sow our green fields

What does the nature
Our blood is contaminated
The soul blackened and cold

The desire for revenge
So many stolen lives
Time changes the vision
As we are
What we are?

Eyes are not blinded
But blindness thus makes

Empty and cold
Oh! Empty and cold

The enemy shows his weakness
Begging for clemency

We drink for the gods
And greet to another victory

Pagan Gods
Pagan Gods
Pagan Gods

The battlefield feeds the bloodthirsty
Hatred does bleed the soul
The feeling of death makes us stronger
Thirsty for battle

She is vampire at her own veins
She is lost for the rest of the time

Luciette I miss you so

She is the first and the last
Cold nights she is the one
Every time she kisses the wind
Every time she embraces the dark(Instrumental)The majestuous diamonds that covers walls
Hurted my eyes like thousand thornes
Sublime artwork mask
That was hidding a cruel fact
Black tears drowning the inside
Without affecting this great structure outside
Perpetual lies, inner conflict, invisibles wounds, strong assault,
Cold fear, dark entrails, burried ideas, suicide images,
Endless pressure, growing torture
Knife painted within the body
Self-hatred mistress
Soundless scream, painful infection
Self-hatred process
It felt like something would go out
But each times it still hurted on the wall
Jailed for eternity in this fucking me
So with a blade
I opened my body
And then the pain flowed...(Instrumental)Once I lived with my land
And tilled the earth with my hands
The sun bore down on my bare back
The rain it ran down my face
The law as clear as the skies
The days went by as the bird flies
Through primogeniture I
Can till this piece of green
And only I can afford it
My life was one with pride
I walked around armed to the teeth
My life was in my own hands

Who has the land we had?

The kingdom drew its lines
That no one else could see
The lines of the earth ignored them
But beaten and cheated by
Traitors and money thieves
The lines of the earth moved for them
They took us into darkness
And chained us to machines
That bit and tore at our misery
So when you hear of slaves
You saw it here first
In English woollen slum dwellery

Who has the land we had?

We look back at the green
And the sheep have devoured the people

The scorched earth
Precursor of doom
Enclosing with time

We're left with the tale of how
Sheep devoured peopleDavnymi slzami, vekov plamena
narekmi krvi.

Zem zotrocena
Rod skoleny
Bohom zmrzacenym
Duch zrazeny.

Nocou pod carom hviezd
Kracat cestami ciest.

Duchom prirody
Slobodou nad okovy
Modly zabudnutych

Nech svitne svetlo Slnka 
ponad nich...

Tam, kde lucom zore stava		
popod tichou oblohou
Tam, kde sero do hor vnara
popod piesnou mesacnou.

V lesoch, planach, lukach sni
Kruh Slovanskej hrdosti
Zo stromov modly a z nich prach
Vytie vlka povstan v nas.

Zialom nad prachom
Srdcom otcov.

Duchom prirody
Slobodou nad okovy
Panteon zabudnutych

Nech svitne svetlo Slnka 
ponad nich...

Nocou pod carom hviezd
Kracat cestami ciest.Blind fools who see only what they tell you to
Open up your eyes you might see it too
See there is a lot to see within you too
Don't be like the rest and let them take it from you

Dumb fools who say only what they tell you to
Speak up and find that there is more
truth within you than you knew
Somewhere someday you will stand before it too
Trust me there is a never ending
mountainside to climb for you too

To enter your mountain
Go into your mountainside
To enter one's mountainside
Will take its man

Who enters his mountain
With or without sword in hand
Who enters his mountainside
He will learn

Deaf fools who arhear it too
Listen there is a wild storm within you too
Burst out use its powers don't be a

Damn fool how can you follow paths
not made by nor for you
The only way you will ever need to
walk is right there for you

He who enter...
He who enters his mountain
Into one's mountainsidethe hammer of thor strikes trough the night
magic is filling the air
war horns echoing into the clouds
and eagles are leaving the lair

the moonlight is shining under the door
exposing the fumes from the lake
spirits are floating above the door
singing horsemen awake

every time a wolf has died underneath the moon
and a crystal path is growing in the froze atmosphere
the gods will throw their curtain over our land
as a blessing for a warrior, prophecy is near

nature is revealing life after death
ancestors are coming alive
so when the aurora begins the dance
we saddle our horse and we ride

we ride trough the gates of human believe
hordes are assaulting the village
raping their women and killiing their children
the men will lie eaten alive

every time a wolf has died underneath the moon
and a crystal path is growing in the froze atmosphere
the gods will throw their curtain over our land
as a blessing for a warrior, prophecy is near

the elements are storming the houses
the paganfrost has been released
a glacier of blood is appearing
and our army of darkness. Will feed

every time a wolf has died underneath the moon
and a crystal path is growing in the froze atmosphere
the gods will throw their curtain over our land
as a blessing for a warrior, prophecy is near

on the night of the paganfrost the men will raise their jars
we slaughtered every human life and even drained their source
now we drink up your beer and mead and listen to the flute
he plays a song of victory and dances to the wolvesMighty men have fought with me all these years. Friends we've lost, 
heroes were born. In every battle we felt the death touching our spirits, 
and the fear became part of our lives. But now it's the time. The 
journey is coming to an end. As the final battle get closer, our hearts seem 
to burn in our chest. The blood will be spilt for the last time. 
Forever.


Hey, honoured warriors
The time has come
Fight 'till death
For the king, for the throne, for the land


While we move towards the enemies
The lost hope reborns in our eyes stronger than ever
Soon we start to hear the screams of pain and despair,
What make us feel stronger
The throne belongs to our king - Our Kingdom is Rising Again!!!(Instrumental)Ooooo, Just a big black set of wheels 
Is what it takes to get me off 
I'm gonna drive all night 
Spin my wheels all night 
It feels all right 
It feels all right 

I don't need no drivers license 
I'm too reckless to survive 
It's like a carburetor instigator 
Feels all right 
Feels all right 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (get up) 

You know I got a fully equipped rock 'n' roll machine 
At speeds that take me high, high, high 
At dead man's curve 
I only hear one word drive, drive, drive 
Drive, drive, drive 

My machine is making headlines 
It gives me love and everything 
It's like an institution of revolution 
It feels all right 
Feels all right 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (pull over, woooo) 

I got the coppers on my tail 
Just for me an A.P.B. 
The sirens spinnin' 
Though it's me who's winnin' 
There're after me 
There're after me 

Before they know just what happened 
I disappeared to their surprise 
I got a Cadillac monkey on my back 
And I don't mind 
No, I don't mind 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (hold on) 

Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 

Slick Black Cadillac 

I lay it down, spin wide and get laid in back, oh yeah 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It makes me feel like a king, alright!Welcome to the bog, where silence reigns
Their existence ends here, it all comes to a halt ...

No place for cowards
No tolerance for the feeble
No respect for the unjust
No life for the unworthy

Along this deserted trail
Bordered by pagan idols
They take their final breath
As the noose is tightened

Kill them for Wuotan!
Kill them for Donar!

Feel your life slip away, darkening before your eyes
Feel the chill of the bog, becoming one with you

Welcome to the bog, where silence still reigns
Their existence ended here, it all came to a halt ...(Instrumental)the bards shall sing of deeds long done
of fallen wolves of Avalon
the bards shall sing of broken blades
great tales of  glory never to fade.
They shall say of Arthur,
and his warrior band
to a man they fell
at cold Camlan
twas long ago
these deeds were done
Let us never forget
what we have become.


The bards shall sing when death prevailed.
When warriors clad in legionary mail,
did face the beast  across the sea
the horde of death and slavery
but British steel
and a will to be free
for outlaws from hell,
together  were we
all battle scarred
we wolves  of war
free like the raven
wild as the boar


This land may fall, its enemies may reign
but we shall never kneel, we shall never be chained.
For this is our British soil, and we shall defend it till the end.The blue moon stirs me
the body is light
and I move effortlessly

As I roam I notice
everything is clear
and bright

At my furthermost point of my
early evening in late winter
I observe a wolf
Steering at the moon

My lesson is let it be
and to be alone
now it is time to trek home

As I make new footsteps
I am waiting for others to follow
now is the time
Teach, learn, do.

As the old memory awakes
the fire kindles
we wait for the mighty horn
the warriors call
HeimdallEvery sight in thine
Makes my love fall
In the deepest feelings of my soul

[Thy beauty face full of grace
Thy soft and white skin
Thy sorrow and tenderness
Thy beauty is seems like an angel]

If only thou could be mine
I engrave my ire on the ice
And I shall wait the sunset
And I would shade my tears
On the roses of thy heart
Just to feel the pain of thy thorns
And the inwounded kiss of thy petals

[Oh, if only thou know it...
The evil love which I shade to thee
It's martiryum that embrace me
All the nights and days]

[The consolation, is the delicious
One poison which I taste of thee
That makes my dreams so ethereal and celestial]

The rain appears on my eyes
Because I know I've fallen from the Paradise
The Paradise thou brought me
With thy sights, with thy smile,
With thy evilness and... with thy pain!

I tear the stars because they shine my tragedy
Because thou don't lie with me...

All the silence and all the pain
Is carven in my heart...Through the Whirlwinds of the Winter Blizzards
To fall upon the Peaks of Assention
To attack the Heights of the Ice
And Swallow the Borders of Time
The Deed of the Furious Fate
The Storm of Blood Rages on
Upon the banal passions teared apart
The symbol of given doom if trampled down
The Foretaste of the Greater Wound in the Wisdom of Greyhairs
To fornicate the very ash
Of the desecrated unwilling fates
The Storm of the Vast Cleansing
Without end, without Polar Dislocation of the Might
Without leaving any reasons for Return
World of the Materia if Opened to be absorbed as a whole,
To be burned through-
Born in the Pain of the illuminated ones
And seen in their Hearts
The Majestic Light is Hidden
In order to aim the Wisdom into the Storm of Blood
This Storm takes The Life beyond the Symbols of consciousness
Where the elements of the feelings are not alive,
But move in Darkness
To be the one with cold Distance of a single minute
It Shines with the empowered Allabsorbtion of Darkness(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Lyrics: Ion)

I hate this realm of venality
I scorn this slaves of pride
I spit upon their reality
I trample on your hide

I Walk my ways
I drink my chalice
I'm out of your grace
I'm out of your malice

Your holy truth turn into lies 
Lies from the lips of holly teachers
They give to You unstinting praise
But You are carrion for your preachers

My words are law
Your words are nothing
Prepare to feel my saw
You see me laughing

Your church is not a bride but whore
I see her fucked with lucifer
She's not a virgin any more
She is of quite another sphere

Where are your stalwarts?
Where are your disciples?
Who knows your tables?
Who reads your Bible?

My path lies through the maze of thorns
Of human heads and human bodies
My head is crowned by crown of horns
I want to crush your holy dadies

I Walk my ways
I drink my chalice
Forever out of your grace
Forever out of your maliceI watch the brooding skies
All hope is lost
I'm going to end my life
Upon a cross

A crown of thorns I wear
I writhe in pain
I perish slow as a martyr
And die in vain

Oh my God, so dark, the nameless one
Oh father please, help thy son
My God, why did you leave me alone?
Are you still my father?

I don't want to meet a fate
Of this cruel kind
'But you will die for all mankind!'

Why must I sacrifice my life
For other's deeds?
'There must be one scapegoat that bleeds for them!'

Why does a father wish death
For his own son?
'Upon the earth you were abandoned!'

Oh, I can't see why all this has to be
'Trust me, for I am your God!'
'Sacrifice your flesh and blood for me!'
Please answer me, what this fate will mean to me at all?
I want to know for what reason I was born
Only to die forsaken and forlorn?
'You will obey your father's decision!'

Belated divine abortion
A life without a sense

Darkness now embraces me
At the threshold of eternity
I curse God, as heavy thunderclouds gather

As an example how to die
A most senseless way
I will become a God on my ownWhen life ends 
Take me away into your land 
Where I shall get life again 
I'll be living after death 
When life ends 
Show me the way into your land 
And I'll come to see the place 
Of my sepulchral inhabitance 
Now I wait 
When my soul will separate 
From the body to the Gates 
Of your Empyrial Reign 
When life ends 
I submiss you with all my heart 
My life ends and now I start 
To confess you God of dark 
Now I see the face of God of dead 
And I hear his voice 
Now he tells me of forthcomin' death 
And my time has come 
Soul prepares to leave my cell 
Soon I'll see the world 
Of Eternal Life 
I will see the Gods 
There I'll taste the wine of aeon 
There I'll see the lakes 
Of the liquid fire 
My flesh will burn in flames 
And my soul will separate 
Now I see the face of God of dead 
When my life will end 
Welcome to my burial... 
All my life I was pain 
Now you'll take my soul away 
Now I'm dying but I smile 
Yes I know this time is mine 
All my friends has come to see as I die 
Now my fathers are Judges of my life 
Now my soul's preparing to fly far away 
And I shall never return to home again 
Into the forest my flesh now will be taken 
At the holy holocaust to soul's awakening 
Now I shall burn in the cleansing fire 
My life ends and I'll get higher 
I'm inviting you welcome to my burial 
Now the shapes of my ancestors are real 
Now I'm making the last flight over 
My life ends but my way is not over 
When life ends 
Welcome to my burial 
Now I see in infra red 
Man can't realize the land 
Where I live now when I'm deadMy little girl
Drive anywhere
Do what you want
I don't care
Tonight
I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself
Over on a plate
Now

Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
I'd rathern to be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything
Please

Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
I'm yours to keep
Do what you want
I'm going cheap
Tonight

You're behind the wheel tonightHe came to defend our Serbian land
For freedom of Europe he made a stand
A Polish knight came to fight
Against turks he brought a light

A Polish knight came to fight
Against turks he brought a light

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

A noble man with black helmet and shield
Was one of the bravest in the battlefield
He rode and fought with his black horse
And cut islamic beasts with no remorse

And cut islamic beasts with no remorse
And cut islamic beasts with no remorse

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

He was really one of the best
In hall of heroes now he rests
Polish warrior and Serbian knights
From the skies support our fight!

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!
Near the Danube you died for us
Black knight - always in our hearts!

Black knight - we will always remember
Serbs and Poles - always together!Why?!
Why has it been so?!
Why must it all show?!
An unbelievable mystery
As complicated as a blackened void if all were there, but none

Might a reward be shown?
Or am I all alone?
The strength is there
But unable to bear

All the violent misery
As a result from mystery
Is transformed into unrelenting hate
And a yearning
For what it has meant to be

HELP!
RETURN!

The emptiness consumes...Wherever we go, whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps
And our breath
Protecting and watching all...
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?


Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure


Sacred is the gift that they
have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
from destruction of time


Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack
Time that is short - distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?


Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure


Sacred is the gift that they
have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
from destruction of timeAnd so I stand
Upon the hill
And so rolls
The winds of gods

Restless are the winds
And as though I am cleansed
The winds pass my side
With the life of a thousand soldiers' battle chants

"Tiu, Teiwaz"

Here has it created
A new rising entity
Possessed by those strong
Of complete determination

So the winds bring force
Force of might and genius
To the created rising god children
They see all in their eyes

All is wiped of haze
Fully restored realization
This is the meaning of life
Brought through the might of rigorous windsIn a gnarly forest of the ancient night 
The way is lost and hidden in conspiracy 
A glowing fire is lighting the abode 
Darkness befalls the everlasting green 
The sun has set and there is no way to go 
Surrounded by the whispers of the creaking woods 
Big Shadows are falling from the moon 
Coldness arises from the humid sparkling soil 

From a far coppice where the treetops fall asleep 
Voices are arising along their way 
Getting stronger with every single step 
Never heard this sound amidst of the Night 

Has the time come for a myth coming true? 
The reason for the harm, a reason for the plague 
Is it really true what the old have told? 
Nasty little feet bring the harm in our home 

The story of the old dwarven chant 
Always told by the oldest wood 
Never to be seen, never to be heard 
A human oath since knighthood 
Rumors being spread and lies go around 
Knights will revere and kings were crowned 
No one will bear, no one will dare 
An unforgettable soun(Instrumental)Born because of Darkness
Full of primitive evil,
We life again.

United by hatred,
We go hurting the weak
We kill enemies - purify the soul.

Our existences are hymns to the glory of Darkness
We ride to wings of Pagan storm
The Moon leads us.

When we fight, we do it to
take the revenge for our brother killed
in the sunshine

We are not mortal...
We've always lived in Darkness!
We are not weak...
Now united we pay the homage
to paganism and our existences!(lyrics: Thorngrim)

Wings of Darkness
Fly up the sky
The sword of Glory
Crack the night!

Ice and Fire
Flesh and Blood
A sacrifice
To my hungry heart.

Songs of forests
And the lightning strikes.
Essence of evil,
Do you hear my growls?

Mother Winter,
Control my mind!
Unholy visions,
You pet my pride!

Winds of Nordland,
You rule tonight!
Take my cold hand,
And lead me to the fight!

Between two candles
My deathly face
And pure blackness
Still in my veins.

The twilight powers return
And destructive eternal flame
When the Darkness reflects
My true infernal Pain!

Oh, ancient moon
And stars on the black night sky
Magic source
Of the frozen violent light.

Open the gates
To the hall of sacrifice
Where I shall grind a fucking human life.

I feel the energy
Of the endless space
Its attractive emptiness
Like the nature's grace.

The black winds destroy
A dirty fucking Christendom
And the wind of my sword returns
To the lovely unholy kingdom

I hear the symphony of twilight
I feel the breathing of frost,
I want to see the sequels of the storm blast
And mysterious realms of ghosts.In my dominion I control the weak
And in vain in pain they turn the other cheek
I'm souless

In my dominion I tear their soul apart
Pure eternal hate run through my soulless heart

I'm soulless to the core I'm 666
I am your death I am the crucifix
On which you are nailed

Their pain makes me strong
I breathe from their fear
I am the one man call wrong
I laugh at their tears
I live where angels cry
I make them suffer my sin
Screams released in agony
As I undress them from skin

In my dominion blood will always reign
I damn your soul to everlasting pain
I'm soulless

I'm soulless to the core...
I am your death...Sorrow, darkness, cold once we feeled,
in a time of eternal war.
In the name of our ancestors we moved from battle to battle
to defend our nation.
Our swords we thirsting for blood,
the ground was covered with snow,
as we moved out into a new battle.
War, fire and death for the enemy.
Swords crashed into each other
Thousands of warriors have been fallen,
here were no mercy and no escape.
Much blood has been shed
Darkness surrounded the field.
We stormed their fortress and burnt their houses
But they could not be found,
Everything was hidden in eternal shadowThrough the Swamps and fog
Through woods and titan rock
White wolves of Wotan
Return to claim the land

Enthroned in the forest old
A throne of woods and stone
The crown restored to the pagan land
The white wolves of Wotan have returned

Through the storm and snow
Through mountains and forest
White wolves of Wotan
Return to claim the land

On the mountaintops the banners rise
Echo of the horns from the mist
Fist of the pagan might now rule the landSleep in eternity, frozen dirt
Left alone in fear, bleed
Down deeper in the land
Which no soul has left

Queen of the shades
Enforcing curses of men
Upon the souls of dead
She dreams in silent hell(Instrumental)Once upon a time, when I was falling through the depths of night
On my quest to find that eternal, brightening light
On the path to my journey's end, where I will find that glowing fire
Which is keeping me and will end my search

I was hiding in the shadows every day and every night
And all the time she stood by my side and was my light

Burning woman of fire and light
Was brightening my life every night
Fiery-red woman, full of heat and pride
All this time she was guiding me, till the dusk of my lifeNascut ai fost, in bezna ca zeii 
Adanc, sub munte, primit-ai suflare 
Iar somnul ti-e veghe de ritmuri solare 
Natura ti-e sora, dand viata ideii. 

Iar blana ta fost-a vesmant de nascare 
Semn spre-alte sfere, celor alesi 
Si-ai fost parasit, lovit de uitare 
Doar pasii-i mai porti prin codrii cei desi. 

Mos intelept, viteaz, sihastru bland

Alter-ego salbatec, in semn de pamant, 
Roata timpului o-nvarti, in somn abisal.(Instrumental)brunst skal brenne deg

trool skal denge degInto the valley of death, rode six hundred valiant men, through infernos flames and billowing smoke, never to be seen again. Sabers drawn at the bugles call, charge for your land and your sires, agony calls, bodies fall, in the rain of cannon fire. 
CHARGE... There's no turning back in the valley of death. CHARGE... Amidst the smoke and the stench of the dragons breath. CHARGE... Past the shells and the viliant that fall. CHARGE... Into the cannons and slay them... ALL!!! 

Crater holes, graves to be, scar the battlefield, the ride is long the charge is hard, no one shall ever yield. The barricades, the destination, let the carnage begin, many lie fallen that answered the calling, vowing to never give in. 

CHARGE... There's no turning back in the valley of death. CHARGE... Amidst the smoke and the stench of the dragons breath. CHARGE... Past the shells and the viliant that fall. CHARGE... Into the cannons and slay them... ALL!!! 

Mounted in glory their sabers shine, for the king and the crown they lay it on the line. Facing the odds staring death in the face, for bravery and honor into battle they race. 

CHARGE... Don't let your country down. CHARGE... Don't let the banner touch the ground CHARGE... With lightning they attack... there's no turning back!(Instrumental)Soldiers marching for death
Awaiting the sign from the gods
To die for their honour

Walkyrjur already waiting by the skyline
For their souls
The sun turns black as hell
Hiding fast
From the fierce blackening
Hate of Odin

Then they attack for the true gods
In the name of death
There is no greater glory
Than to die in battle

"As Odin rages in black anger for
his brave men on the battlegrounds..."

Now battling and dying
By sword and axes' ice cold steel
Truth now nears the moment
Darkness won
Ultimate glory for Aesir
The gods
Soulwinds in the battlesky...Sweet lips 
Bleeding love 
Kiss the death 
So cold, iced 
Let me cry tonight 
under this cold rainThe rites of black candles and death, the scent of blood and incense
Through the smoke of the burning cauldron, I call upon Thee

Him who absorbs the light, Mephisto, I pronounce your blasphemic name
He who enjoys the stench of sulphur, Satan

I demand your powers to serve my will, I perform the evil dance
As thou danced before Solomon, o mighty Belial

Kingdom of God is open for me
I desecrate the holy gate in honour of Satan

I indulge in perversion and sin
Oh, great lord Lucifer, grant fulfilment upon my desires

My soul is the key to Satan's kingdom of magic

In honour of Satan, demons rejoice
In honour of Satan, I spill blood, the blood of man

In honour of Satan, demons rejoice
In honour of Satan, I spill blood, the blood of manLaying low in the stronghold preparing our swords for attack.
Yesterday only brought us great loss, but then again yesterday is the past. Burial of all beheaded men is done, now we're awaiting the night. They go with the mist the legend does foretell, the fire serpent rouse us to alarm. Even the bravest amongst us seem to feel the slightest fear, useless though your fate was sealed long ago at the well. Men may hide from death in battle, death will find them in the end. Death in battle brings us glory, 
rise before your place is taken!

Thunderous clouds dress the heavens, bolts of lightning coming down from the skies. Streaming rain comes down like poisoned whips, screams of anguish echo through the night. Thousands of torches ablaze the battlefield, their horrid faces seem alight.
No one can tell if they're animal or man but demons of war of that everyone is certain.

Raise yourself pick up your sword and fight death will be your reward. Beware of the one with the horns of power, it is he who has the might. Hordes of enemies storming towards me I can almost taste their blood.
Raise my sword so hungry t' is for fight it will be satisfied on this night. Burning hatred in their eyes is all I see in this night. Rush towards me and attack for your head it will be mine.

My sword is deeply thrusted in flesh I laugh as I watch you die. Swining my sword from left to right, adrenaline takes me ever so high! Breaking backs and arms and necks, blood fills my every sight. Assurance arises in my mind I know I will not die in this fight! A hymn arises from behind the enemy line, grim and harsh it's words hack through my skull into my mind.

We are of the vapor, mist and storms, heralds of the ancient goddess. Invisible in the night we ride upon the mist, rightful kings of the bloodstormWe are the dark angels came out of the darkness
Pick up all the gifts that you have stolen.

Everything, from the banal simplicity
No, we didn't come to read commandments.
Take away all the senses, until recently,
You don't need - you don't use.
Don't wait until you come to salvation,

From the truth, not hide!
Since our arrival and the arrival of darkness
Begins what should happen,
May not avoid a war
But human mistakes shouldn't happen again!

We are the dark angels came out of the darkness
Our mission is to take back what was stolen
You have lost the sympathy and kindness,
Your hearts have stopped beating long ago time.

Don't appreciate what is given by eternity,
Why do you need superfluous concern?
Flatter and cover imaginary diligence
And as in the past century, not conquers heights.

But human mistakes should not happen again.

How you can be so squalid?
Why take something that doesn't need?
You don't atone for the sins 
And fall to the bottom...

We are the black angels came out of the darkness
Give up, your struggle with us are useless!
Don't be afraid of your moral nakedness
Agree that for you this is not the first time.(Instrumental)Falling
The fires of Gehenna
Hellish demons
Eternal damnation
Soaring
Open wide the gates of hell
Primal force
Nature's core

Into the abyss - Into the abyss

Waiting - Satan's repossessing my soul
Longing for - Unity with the ones I love

Into the abyss - Into the abyss

Awaiting the condemned
Awaiting my descent
Carnivorous intent
My following awaits

My hell has been on earth
Time now to divert
Return my true identity
I will enjoy it splendidly

Welcome
You shall be my only son
The one I trust
The chosen one
Consolidation
Solidarity of souls
Community
Togetherness and unity

Into the abyss - Into the abyss(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Black fire is the force
the spirit and the curse
on those who want to take
out strength away

The Soil under your feet
is bloodred from their deeds
Yield now there's better
nothing in our way

And there We are
the keepers of the pagan rights
We salute to the gods -
the gods in walhall
we've got the tunes
the spirits on our side
we send our rivals to hel

Black Fire
Black Fire on their god
Black Fire
Black Fire on their church
Black Fire
Black Fire on their lords
Black Fire
Black Fire is their curse

Black Fire
And victory to us

And so our Chants
will clang for evermore
Reverberate through
grief and dolor

We sowed the black winds deep
within your minds
And Now it's you
to reap the storm
On the wings of an eagle
we fly through the night
Holding their fish in our claws
On the black winds of freedom
against all false light
Exposing the light of their laws

Black Fire
Black Fire on their god
Black Fire
Black Fire on their church
Black Fire
Black Fire on their lords
Black Fire
Black Fire is their curse(Instrumental)Now the sun has risen
The dark assault has started
They are unfinished
They are the fear of man

Look behind
I can't see the end
Hear my oath
We'll never lose
Victory or Death

Pain becomes my breath
My ultimate life's reason
I say don't be afraid
Justice is with us

In the sky
The sun lights the day
In my eyes
A fire burns again

See the Prince of Death
On the Iron Hills
Only blood and brutal madness
Evil fury comes
Theater of pain
Lies before my eyes
The sun is dark, the fields are blood
It's the Hell on earth

My steel was never defeated
My mind was never corrupted

Now a messenger of death
Flies up into the sky

And while I'm fighting
Jalwink stands proud
Now a messenger of death
Destroys the life of men
And while I'm dying
Jalwink's falling down

My steel was never defeated
My mind was never corrupted

Now a messenger of death
Flies up into the sky(Urbinati/Rico)

Brain dead, descending to flame 
No way to survive or have life regained 
Re-animation to bring back the dead 
Revive the soul, resurrect 

Synthetically revived to regain control 
The spirit world sends back my soul 

Pierce the needle through the back of my head 
Chemiclas flow, I'm revived from the dead 
Brain exists, my soul descends 
Re-animated, my sleep ends 

The final curtain has been opened to regain my soul 
Blood restores my flesh, ice cold 

Awakened, now I break the silence of life 
Raging uncontrollably, pummeling with spite 

Re-animatedLike flies drawn to oblivion's light our fears are in control
prophetic warnings cosmic signs so eager to behold
who's to say when it all comes down whether in flames or flood
none will be spared not humans nor their gods 
we are the end we are the plague apocalypse rejoice
biological death machines designed to destroy

Death rains from the sky
carving our demise
realized too late
we are the shapers of our fate

Seven billion riders straddle the pale horse
storm the gates of heaven and slay without remorse
not even angels stand a chance appeasing our demands
laying Gaia in her grave with our own bare hands 

Death rains from the sky
carving our demise
realized too late
we are shapers of our fateBeside the fire I look to the distant hills
I think about the battles that happaned here in the past
On the cold air I can still feel the lives
Of warriors who bravely faced their fates

Alone, I walk through stone and trees
I feel the frozen wind in my face
At this moment, many men take the same path
To the lake of ice in the forest

The lake of ice of the distant forest
Keep, with its thousands of years
Many memories of a forgotten past
Of braves who once here lived

Around the lake of ice we raise our swords
For the honour of those whose blood was spiltVOLKSKRACHT (lyrics: Ezra, Dries. music: Dries)

Wij doorklieven de hemel
als vurige ruiters.
Verrassingsaanval bij nacht,
wij heersen over't land!

Van Hasselt tot Aken,
Wellen tot in Peer,
van Herk tot Kerkrade,
Valkenburg tot Heers!

Wij razen, branden, slaan!
Van Kempen tot de Rijn.
Wij beroven kerk en stand!
Van Haspengouw (tot) over 's Maas.

Gevreesd en berucht zijn wij,
door kerk en staat!
Bokkenrijder zijt gij,
die altijd rechtdoor gaat!

Wij bevrezen tollenaars,
en iedereen met macht!
Wij stelen 's rijken vracht,
het gewone volk tot kracht!

Eigen volk eerst,
pas dan adel en staat!
Wij vrezen galg noch rad,
en kennen geen verraad!

Wij schuwen geen gevaar,
wij vechten voor de eer!
Drinkgelag en Volkskracht,
het is 't ons meer dan weerd!

With their gold and their power.
Ride on your path,

Dominance & submission
Abolish all prohibitions
Domesticated violence
A sacred woe of silence
The safe-word is die!

Sitting on the floor by your master's feet
Hanging in meat hooks from the roof
Gorging with a ball in your mouth
Speaking only if spoken to

A mask of leather
Raw rubber touch your skin
Electricity in your nipples
The lash caress your back

Unanimous decision - No-one is conflicted

Pleasure and pain - No lash is in vain
Food for your soul - Your body is mauledOne life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said i'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'

That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks

If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You got another thing comin

In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow

Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'Seek now, brave man
To the Northland, meet our friends
And take this staff as your guide
Seek and find the Northernland

Over the hand of Elverheim
Where lays our path?
There where the sun never travels
Restless, we will be

Time is not on our side
Soon night will fall

Towards the isle of Bezeroth
Where no man returned
With our guide
Restless we will be

Time is not on our side
Now we must go

When the clouds darken the sky
And the mist impede our sight
Than we can pass by the isle
Where than the Northland appears

Rest now friends
The wisdom of
Mystis and Silenoz
Will guide our fate

The shores of Northland
How far away now?
Listen, comrades

We will be seen
Time is not on our side
Soon we'll arive
Hail friends!!!
Come on land
Hail Northman!!!!!!!It' s no good I' m fed up,
I' ve been pushed out to the limit...
This time I' ve had enough!
Don' t care, anywhere,
Just far away from here...
I know anywhere else
must be better than this!
New day: hope arrives...
When the wind takes me away
Towards all my desires!
It' s no use to stay...
When the night retreats away
Thete' s no hope for our escape!
It' s no good, I' m fed up,
Tied up with mistrust n' disgust...
It' s getting all too much!
The shade, the light,
the light, the shade,
The shade, the light
alternate in random...
I' d run, but I' m held here by a chain!
Here I still stand,
just my shadow' s bona fide...
Now my soul is free to take flight...!
Dodgy, shady moonlight...
Giving me a new sign when the day breaks at sunrise...!
Everything commences likewise:
Shadows destroyed by frenzied light!
A new day promises new hope...!
Nocturnal shadows all
disappear and leave my face!
Everything bleeds to death n' dies
that was here in yesterday!
A new day promises new hope...!
I feel dreams summon me again...
As I tear apart all my chains...!On the wings of time, I've seen everything.
From the birth of mankind until it's end.
In a battle between two worlds.

Emptiness,
Great silence,
That breaks into the noise of a material War.
Chaotic landscapes,
Dead bodies,
Blood filled waters,
Like another filthy universe.

The result - of that great fucking conflict,
between the scum under the half moon and
the sheep of god.
A new world order beyond mankind.
Earth reigned by itself.
No place for a god. No need for a god.

On the wings of time, I've seen everything.
From the birth of mankind until it's end.
In a battle between two worlds.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Corkhill, Trad. English)

Fate dwell in the field
On the hill it beckons the dawn
Eternal as the earth
It beckons the lives of men

Harmer and healer of all
Time is but a thread
Woven for men
Walking the road before them
He who wandered
He who strayed
Is he who fought and died
He who became the wind and earth

The sun shines over the hill, calling all men who stand
He who hears cannot return, life is not in his hands
Under foot, the dust and soil, lies what we cannot see
In time knowledge will come, one day all men are free

The path of proud men
Heave and horror
Pride and fear
Trust and guilt
Eternal as the earth

Fate calls from the wind
All men must yield
The answer is on the hill
In the field, in the earth, in the waves
Destiny is everything
Paths do not always lead
But must always be followed
Walking the road before you

He who wandered
He who strayed
Is he who fought and died
He who became the wind the earth

The sun shines over the hill, calling all men who stand
He who hears cannot return, life is not in his hands
Under foot, the dust and soil, lies what we cannot see
In time knowledge will come, one day all men are freeSwords of Blood 

The power of glory, fire in the sky 
The signal of the battle 
Death bells proclaim the beginning of the battle 
Deep inside I see them profiling the mountain 
The Black crow brought the signal 

Ashes in the castle 
Fire in the horizon 
Sword of blood 
Attacking my kingdom 
I invoke the master of darkness tonight 
Master, bring your wisdom and your power 
My soldiers are weak and tired 
In this journey to the eternal glory 

Fire in the Horizon 
Swords of Blood 
Attacking my Kingdom 

Bring us the power of your sword 
Shed over us the glory of blood 
March against the fire in the top of the mountain 
Riding in your black horse 
Make worth the sanctity of your black spirit 
Sword of blood ,bring us the power of glory 

Fire in the Horizon 
Swords of Blood 
Attacking my KingdomEverything is broken
Chaos in my mind
Booze is a bitch
And my passion for life is dangerous
I have a feeling
That I do everything the other way round
The inner demon broke silence
And you broke into tears
If I push too much
I won't make any difference
Feelings of guilt ...
It seems so absurd and futile
I don't really know what else I should do
I better move on
Why can't things be as they used to be?
Everyone is so grumpy tonight
Hey fucker, something's gonna happen tomorrow
And you may understand the meaning of your dull life
It's freezing cold outside
I'm staggering down the street
Beaten up and lonely
My will conforming to the instinct of war
And limbs want to destroy
Blackout caused by a fall
Broken face, body bruised
An emotional fit taking turns
With burst of laughter
I'd like to cry but I don't know how to
The only solution is sleep
Then I'll board up window
And be your cute little boyI count i count slowly but i don't know how much
It remains
I see the leaves falling i count them they re falling
Slowly close to me
But their impact to earth frosts blood

I had so many dreams,
Bit the wind has swept them so far away

A carpet of leaves covers the ground i would
Carry them away
I wish the wind could caress them again and it still
Kissed by the sun,

But now they are withered, cold
But tonight i look up and continue to countAt the dead of the night when the moon shines so bright
 And the rowan trees're alright in the dark
 When they come close to me then I breathe easily
 Hit the light is around

 Now we know where we are going
 Kind of seeds we have to sow in
 When you are ready then call me
 To let turn alive Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood

 Let me tell you the truth of the one lied to you
 Realize break it through again and again
 Turn around and you'll see what it's all has to be
 The revival is near

 Now we know where we are going
 Kind of seeds we have to sow in
 When you are ready then call me
 To let turn alive Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood

 We are Earth, Wind, Fire and BloodStones Uder The Hooves
As Hard As Ice
Wind In Ears
Freezes Every Thought

We The Winterknights
Ride Throught The Realm
Hailing Our Mighty Kings
With The Roaring Warcries

Swords Let To The Wind
Sing An Ancient Saga
Till Our Blades Meet With Flesh

Our Black Hearts
Filled With Hatred
Our Black Hearts
Filled With Might

Thy Name is Death

Enshroud Me.. In Misanthropy

Cast the Spell.. Of Eternal Hellfire

Gathering of the Hordes.. For the Final BattleCome wind, by my side.
My sin... why I ride ?

We're running over hills,
storming through deep woods,
we are using ancient skills...

...Running out of rules!

Searching nature round... we're looking down the hill,
Watching rays of light, a triumph of the will.

Grey skin of the land...
cold wind, flying sand...

Howling hordes of wolves
chilling waves of light,
it's the calm before the fight!

Searching nature round... we're looking down the hill,
Watching rays of light, a triumph of the will.Is het de lucht de dood in de ether
Of de half duistere maan
In de zwarte nacht?

Oh Germania!!!Fear comes to my head
And the shine of your eyes appears in front of me
The noise go away
And a silence untruth purify my mind

The circle of light and darkness
It's a feeling incessant that I'm nothing
It doesn't sence to be here
Myabe somebody listen to...

I've already stopped to look
But even it's here
The window reflects and lights my soul
I won't carry on

Far away you
It seems the same

The night will never end
And nobody can save me
The sky will cloudy
And the stars will fall in front of me

Would you want to change...?

Maybe in other life where the red sky and
The dance of black stars throw beams over me

Would you really want to change...?
Would you really want to change your life?

Tell me why
I can't live
Tell me why
What is waiting for me

I have die, maybe will be better this
I beg pardon to can rest
I'm down on my knees in front of you
I can't anymore(Instrumental)Freedom is why I'm gone
I live by the sword
I bow to none
A path of an outcast who lives on the run
No time to regret the things I've done

Crawling on the trail of sorrow
Dreaming of a new tomorrow

Warriors
Who fought your battles
All across this cruel world
The've died - Long before
Your fallen brothers gave their souls
And their lives - Forget them not

My heart's a poisoned well
Enchanted by dark spells
Should kill fire and thirst
Drink from it and you'll be cursed
You'll be cursed

Warriors - Forget them not(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Rapture!
Death lord... Iak Sakkath!
Embrace me, as you command your black winged horde.
Bow down before the master!
Raise your horn in blasphemy
I am demonized

Scorn the throne of blessing, and make them cry for their salvation.
Raise your horn in blasphemy
I am demonized.
Bestial torment, vomit upon their cross and burn their book of lies.

Antichrist... Rise and destroy the temple of dementia

Rapture!
Death lord... Iak Sakkath!
Embrace me, as you command your black winged horde.
Bow down before the master!
Raise your horn in blasphemy
I am Satanized!

The sky above me turns red like flames from hell
Raise your horns in blasphemy
I am Satanized!

Morbid Angel, rape the mother and child of holiness
Kill the son of god, and Jesus Christ dies
I am encircled by chaos!

After thousand of years... Upon this chaos,
A child was born.
Born by madness.
Born by darkness
Born by blizzards
Born by flames,
Born Satanized!!!(Instrumental)- DRAGONSHIP -

Ride with me on the endless sea
Across the waves among the brave
And if we die don't ask me why
Cause this is the way of the strong and the great 

Feel your eyes spiting fire and ice
Cry for your life, once you live once you die
You may live a minute you may see the light
You may face the darkness but don't fear the night

"Sail onto the Dragonship
And this could be your last trip
But wisdom and glory lies ahead
As the Ancient Gods of War have said

Hoping to find them before your death
Let the wind take your last breath
And as you leave Midgard behind you
Remember all those who stood beside you"

Sail across oceans of darkness and light
Demons are waiting to face their last time
When seafarers kill with all power and might
The skies become crimson as Valkyries fly

Odin come forth show the way feed the beast
Through red mist raise your steel armored fist
Under the veils of unknown oceans deep
Immortal all those who sail on Dragonships

On bow I stand, the wind blows my hair
As I walk through the halls of Valhalla
Let the flames burn away, like dust in the air
To a place where immortals may live foreverFrom ashes of this world
From the deep Black of Night
We are in misery

From freedom of faith
For glory of your Hate
we are marching on crusade

Marching for to search your king for kill him,
We need holy blood in our skin.
Across the gates of sky, and felling your faith,
the words as you say: Mercy!
Die!

Faith, Behold
Hell, Honor
Chose your fate

Praying for God, but
Living in hell
Faith for nothing

Die! Sit down in your Throne
Sit down in your fame
Fell my arrive
Pray! for just your life
To arrive in a "paradise"
we are marching on crusade
And you will fallFires shine, whilst shadows wane 
From frozen ground, fragile blossoms spring 
No stars or moon through iron clouds 
Beneath my feet all root and thorns 
Through marsh and bogs on forlorn paths 
Through times of for, a wondrous haze 
Young trees I've seen, skybound they rose 
To mighty oaks in countless years

Raise to the sky 
From frozen ground 
The shreds of new life abound 
Through winter cloud 
Sun slowly breaks 
New life awaits the dawnThere had winds arise
They made clouds so dark
In the storm-sky
In the black mirk

Then they had strip up
Drowsy fields of grass
And prophetic stars
Fall from sky

Open to me gates
Let me know the seckrets
Or will weakly fall
Three of Universe

Waiting is my life
Under snow of ash
Like this blood red
River my flow

Veiled dream prophetic
Will occurs like shadow
In the abysstime
It will vanish from the life

I see blood
On the grass
I see blood
In the blaze

There had winds arise
They made clouds so dark
In the storm-sky
In the black mirk

Then they had strip up
Drowsy fields of grass
And prophetic stars
Fall from skyI come into your life
I'm like a mystery to you
Like an undiscovered land
Full os secrets
The spark in my eyes
Makes you so blind
I steal your soul
And poison your mind

Sleepless night again
Darkness surrounds you
Everywhere you look
You still see my eyes

Cleave her body into twoFrom the deception of hearts I hide,
And the nature of lust that keeps us blind
By breaking the chains of the bind,
Soon we will find there's more to unlock inside...

A life spent alone is one rich in growth
The life of the introvert harnesses a fiery chasm
An endless spiritual depth, complete with wisdom
Just wait and see what patience yields for me

Deciphering the vault
Unearth treasures of the soul inside
To solitude you have been called
An enlightening voyage you will find...

Uncovering secrets behind fleshes door
A hunger for truth, a yearning for more
A desire to grow is all I long for...
Pursuit of a prolific life is what's in store...The unpleasant night arrived after the Sun's death,
the great druid began the ritual sacrifice,
forgotten rites after the christian invansion,
recovered by blood and war.

The prophecy predicted the arrival of god's death,
the end of the Cosmic Order.

Blood rivers will be born from the old mountains,
ancient cults will reign over mankind
in search of perishable tranquillity.

The woods will remain in darkness
consecrated by blood and skulls of the sacrificed ones,
in those forest the stone altar will be honoured
by human bones, wild bear fangs and animal skeletons...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Kad izdahnu iza brda vatra nadzemaljska
Zora jedna bese oplakana
Jos u suton,smiraj dana,pre Meseca
Tmurnog neba gospodara,jos pre zvezda,
Okrutnih sudjaja,stop o mraku sudbu kroje,
Avetima nocnim utrobu sto poje.

Srebrni me bodez kraj putanje ceka,
Vratim li se ziv u slavi,sjajno ce da sija
Nestanem li s' Jave,od vlage ce da rdja.

Majci svojoj zariven u nedra
Do nestanka sveta na me da se seca
Kovaca svog sto iskova mnogo smrti
A sad njemu smrt kuju!

Sudjaje me levom stranom gurale
Polu-mrtve kucke s' tropuca meni su kukale
Uplakane deve zamnom slamu su bacale,
Crnu dusu moju nebil' ukrotile!

Cetres' dana mrtva dusa na prokletiji spava,
Cetres' mi dana s' duse krvari rana-
Smrti pospesi!
Izvidaj me I resi
Ovog uzasnog bola I zivota!

Doletite orli I gavrani,
I mojim se nasladite mesom,
Dok pogledom svojim ja streljam nebesa!
S' vrha brda na kom stoji
Kamen stolovan,
Kraj koga je bistra voda vecna,
Iz koje mi preti odraz moj,
Da tu smrknem jednom zanavek..

Jos me ceka bodez moj od srebra,
Od vremena ostareo,
Ali stoji mudro s' svojim znakom-
-Jos je tu,ali zardjao!I am the sun
the bringer of light
I am the moon
the guardian of night
I am the sky
where gods have their throne
I am the sea
the depths of unknown

I am the connection between the contrasts
I am the emptiness where nothing can last

I am the earth
the womb of the mother
I am the wind
the voice of the father
I am the woods
where no way is leading
I am a glen
where spirits are dreaming

I am the yearning striving for salvation
I am the path that leads into revelationDrag my corpse across the sand to the tower of silence
Lay my body down with my kin, pile our remains up to the sky
Let my blood join with theirs, let the birds clean my bones
Let the winds carry away the demons who are freed when we die
May my final gift to the Earth be to cleanse her of my memory
If the bodies of the just are poisoned and unclean
Then what hope remains for a wretch like me?(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Spirit of war
Which is enlightened in our hearts
By the heritage of our blood
The blood of Aryan ubermensch

We shall be triumphant forevermore
Enshrine our blood, so pure and divine
Protect it for the sake of our future
The fate of those chosen in the beginning

Der sieg ist unser
The victory is ours
Der sieg ist unser
Aryan blood enshrinedTHE DAWNING 
Deep into the darkest streams of rage 
a child was raised under the sign of hate 
no one heard the whispers of his faith 
his soul was slaughtered, he had to face the death 

But proud he stood on what he was, 
as he sat down next to a myth, 
heir of the light, bringer of darkness, 
he followed a path leading to madness 

One among a million he was born 
one drop in an ocean full of groans 
great, and nonetheless, so miserable 
over and over again to be torn down 

One among a million I was born 
the last standing man I will become 
the awaited renewal for my soul 
the blackest finale for them all 

THE CROSSROADS 
One more drop in the ocean makes no difference at all 
I will decide my fate, that's the only way 
everyone shall know my name 

THE BLEAKNESS 
My shell was always my guidance and protection 
thus, I could not look outside, at this rotten realm 
harsh winds of filth feed the lungs of men 
and no one's safe at their own home 

If you can see the end coming, 
then you do not look beyond enough 
at last the night is here 
and all the whispers become sincere 

I will ignite the flame on the ones that lost their light 
betrayed origins are the depiction in the canvas of human life 
earthly is the will of man against the iniquity in their minds 
the whole divide of oneness will bring salvation at your last gasp 

The realm of the mortals is burning, into the fire 
all the bodies have begun to perish 
in the name of death I cast the spell 
so you may suffer as I bid you farewell 

THE CLEANSING 
Wake up from your sleep 
all the torments have been set free 
choose the path that you believe in 
because the future can't be foreseen 

Follow me to embrace the gift of life 
inside the grief you'll find a place for calm 
let the rain cleanse all of your sorrow 
to face the day while past is gone"Rise your head to bleak horizon - 
Sky is covered with dark blood; 
Think of all the time you've wasted 
Singing prayers to false god; 

In illusions you were crawling 
Underneath the dying sun; 
Lost in labyrinth of idols, 
But there was another one..." 

The one, who damned hope, 
Who refused to worship 
And believed in power 
Of his sharpened will. 

Cold wind whispers of the human, 
Who believed in afterdeath; 
And for saving there his mind 
Consecrated every breath; 

Crossed Black River of the Fallen 
To infinity's domain - 
He released the frightful power 
Of Tarot's thirteenth Arcana... 

"Damn the hope 
And destroy your weakness 
To obtain true power 
Of your Master's will."Oh, warriors 
of brave souls.

I'm trying to turn black into white,
Make it brighter make it cleaner

The path is paved with blood
Of others almost deadened
No time to think about
What is waiting in the end

Never thought I would be the same
Same as you, same as they're
Never thought I would join you there
A Place we all have to share

Dead-end, closed curve
Time to learn that

There's no fate
Just stumbling blinded in the dark
There's no fate
In this crate
Obscure fragments lit by the sparks
In the world of shade

Useless actions, pointless words
Who's above it, who's behind
Wrong directions, uncertain paths
Darkened souls, moulded minds
Dead-end, closed curve

There's no fate
Just stumbling blinded in the dark
There's no fate

At the end it's all in vain
Faith is lost, trust is lost

Raven whispering

Imagine... midnight wood
Leaves are falling down from trees
Let begins... election...
Sovereign to rule heathens...

Unknown man,
Lonely stranger... is coming into camp
Veiled in cape
Staff in hand... oaken branch from olden land.

Traveller, whispering:
Place I am coming from, lies many days of walk to east, I've come along the nature side.
Wood around gave food to me, it sent me rain to drink,
leaves under my head... were my scented pillow.
I see this ancient wood... full of memories...

Hunters:
Be welcome wayfarer... come and rise some pints with us!
Then... tell us, who you are... and where's your journey destination,
our tribe is looking up to those..who reach up dangerous land around.

Traveller:
Believe me... honestly
Old blood's flame is burning in your eyes
I can see your ancestors
Fortune is... standing on your side..

Ancient scrolls... are speaking clear
"...Find last independent nation..."
Help them grow,
teach them how... use their blood's might.

Hunters:
Our tribe is looking up to those... who reach up dangerous land around!That night I started what will be
A long, long journey back home
From the green and distant lands of the north
Hoping for nothing about what future or
Fate prepared for me
I packed and I rode saying, farewell!!
To the Cantabrian sea

Aswell as their men unconquerable are
Their weather and lands
To show no mercy for the pilgrims who dare
Enter their domains
The night was born, my blood ran cold
When suddenly I was
Surrounded by the thickest and densest fog
I had ever known

Lost among the trees, within the fog
Out of my head, but not alone
The night-spirit looked after me
I built a fire and I laid down to sleep

While I was lying, waiting for the dawn
Thinking about the end of the road
I felt asleep and dreamt of
My tribe, my clan, my land, my home

And then the sunset again
Brought back to life my spirit
The strength of fire to my veins and my eyes
The day was born, my hour had not come
And I received the present for being a fighting man

And then I started my trip again
Marching homewards to tell
I walk victorious by the side of the sun
Alive!
Invictvs!THE MARCH OF THE BROKEN SOULS

My body covered with blood
Walks dragging a broken sword. 
The cold burns my wounds, 
the darkness surrounds to me...  

Spirits of the forest, 
Old dead soldiers 
Show me the way 
In these hours of desperation.  

Again the fire begins to burn.  
The howls  freeze the air.  
soldiers  born again
Of ashes, ice and blood.

listen to the scream of the broken souls 
in the darkest night, they will rise

Of  shades I dye my armor, 
I raise my fire sword, 
the crows will be my guardians 
and my spirit will fly free.  

Once again the darkness
Are by my side 
and it gives me forces 
to fight until the end.

This is the march of the broken souls!  
This is my land and this is my blood!  
This is my hate and this is my sword!  

I will never back down, 
I will never surrender.(Instrumental)Satan, Belial, Lucifer, Leviathan

His infernal majesty - Enthroned to rule the chosen ones
Who defines good and evil?
Who reaps what  you sow?

Infernal majesty - Indulgence and vital existence
Infernal majesty - Wisdom, integrity, hatred
Infernal majesty - Vengeance and sins of the flesh
Infernal majesty - Blasphemy, diabolical indignation

Who judges and stigmatizes?
The christian doctrine must go

The true prince of evil
The king of the slaves
Your name is Christ
King of hypocritical traits

Where the strong will survive
And the weak will be slain
In a world ruled by justice
That's where Satan will reign

Infernal majesty - The prince of darkness
Infernal majesty - Serpent of old
Infernal majesty - Son of perdition
Infernal majesty - The monarch of deities

Infernal majesty - Vengeance and sins of the flesh
Infernal majesty - Blasphemy, diabolical indignationFrail morning light
Creeps the barren land
Fears kept clandestine
Chained in unsound mind

Cast in fire, stained with hate
Deep has rooted the lack of faith
Glowing the ashes, blinding the smoke
Tracks lead backwards and dispersed is hope

Runes carved on flesh
Yet unknown stayed within
What bloomed turned rotten
... a path best forgotten

Dreams deranged they fell a torn
In scorched heart the wisdom was born
Cursed the one with parting ways
Cursed the on who waits and stays


Cursed the oneFlapping wings, glowing eyes
Pointed teeth in a craving smile
Clutched by sin, I will lie
With the lady I obey

Dark clouds passing by
The full moon's wary eye
Observes as we fly
In gloomy midnight skies

The nightflower will flourish just for me
Entwined so deeply in its sumptuous leaves
A blossom in moonlight, carved by its liquid shine
Gaia, Maia, unearthly womb
I crave to vanish into her tomb
Whore of Hades, wench of night
Sinful mistress, nocturnal bride
Her scent of witchcraft, I admire
On crimson lips I'll quench my desire

My damnation I shall find
Temptress of all Demonkind
Amidst the burning pentagram
She unlocks her dark dominion
So take my soul, where no mortal eyes can see
Unveil to me all hell's mysteries

My sweet betrothed, Ill be your groom
Sinister bride, my harbinger of doom
The darkness, the shadows, the power, the glory
Forge them all! I sense my swelling greed
Temptation, Damnation, ecstatic sensation
Her gate is open wide, promising everything I need

You're the only one for I will fall
Whore of Babylon - eat my soul
Heave in sinful shivers, feel me deep
Liquid fire's emanating in thee

Queen of lust, Darkness I entwine
Succubus, lure me in a love malign(Instrumental)On the winds of battle fresh in the sky
Loosened and free
Drawn by your dark destiny

In the halls you swore that you'd earn your names fame
But the chances are slim
Of fighting a man you can see

We will meet your eyes
Ours to hypnotise
This begins the end
The end of mine and your songs

On the winds of battle fresh in the skies
The moment is free
Our master is your destiny

Flames and blazing fire
All around devoured
This begins the end
The end of mine and your songs

I will serve no master when unstrung

Face the iron-tipped shower
Raining on our shield wallDefend the weak - Fight for the right
Justice we serve - Live like a knight
Honor gives strength - Truth fills with pride
Immortal on our lonely ride

Noble armor of chivalry
Alone you walk - Alone you pass
Through night or bright day

Embraced by the duty
For a better world
United by the code and the creed
Noble armor of chivalry

My heart my armor - Tall and strong
To tell what's right - To tell what's wrong
My words are sharp - They cut like steel
My sword - My principles - My will

Deceivers and traitors
Deceivers crawl under my feet
Disciplined
Oath-sworn to the codeWe gather with excitement
Can you feel it in the air ?
The toll of many journeys
Has been frozen in my stare
We travel darkened roads at night
A longing for a welcome sight
The evening sky ignited by the glare
Close my eyes
And it takes me away
Shade my eyes
And I'm finding my way
Give to me warm winter nights
Lead me home,northern lights
Give to me warm winter nights
Bring me home,northern lights
The memory burns with faces
Can you still recall the names ?
The souls we had to bury
Who could not survive the game
We come into your stomping ground
Fixed onto the midnight sound
No longer can refer to us as tame
Close my eyes 
And it takes me away
Shade my eyes
And I'm finding my way
Give to me warm winter nights
Lead me home,northern lights
Give to me warm winter nights
Bring me home,northern lights
We search for hearty presence
Will you join us in our quest ?
The music flows with urgency
To find a soul obsessed
Untangle you from earthly ties
Provide you with your alibis
We've chosen you
To take the noble test
Close your eyes
And we'll take you away
Shade your eyes
And you're finding your way
Give to me warm winter nights
Lead me home,northern lights
Give to me warm winter nights
Bring me home,northern lightsRed lights shimmering on the streets in the city

Where is light is also darkWandering through the night. Seeking an absolution. Searching for the truth unknown. Past but faded memories. Time seems to stop. Wolves from an unknown origin. Chase the stars from the skies. I look to my past, but find only mist. A deep unforgiving wall. Although the war inside me marches on. I fight only the thoughts of time. Without the happiness of life. I exist no longer. An image defined as faded. My journey ends, where I began. Death only a dream now. A peace I reach for in vain. Immortality a curse man begs for. Until he finally gets his wish.Germania in chains, ravaged by wars
Life and death, governed by steel

In these times resistance is spawned
its grimness corresponding to the land

Death prevails on moonless nights
When men are turned to wolves
With blackened shields and swords
Harjaz from the underworld

The end is near when the night is black
and hailstorms scourge the land
When demonic warriors arise
Ghosts without a past

Eredication is at hand
When terror fills their hearts
and an icecold staggering gale
will carry their souls away
Rising from the soil like fog
Demise lurking in the dark
Warriors of Teutonic blood
Sworn to the gods of war

Germania unchained, eager for war
Their demise, delivered by steel(Instrumental)10. Roth Cingetos Taxonaria

It's riding, it's riding,

In the circle of moonlight;

Mortal's fate is a star 
But it's glow fades in twilight...

We are bound to Death 
And our watch is eternal."Aanhoor allen t verhaal

hij gaf zen leven voor de kwelling van zijn volk
verguld zijn sporen
van hij die t land leegzuigt
maar bij de brugsche metten oogst men zoete wraak

Mijn lans vol bloed met bruut geweld
spies ik ze neer aan 't doden veld
met m'n hellebaard 2 hoofden
neer het regent bloed
vervuild het meer

styxen en hellebaarden

oog om oog tand om tand
de franken in het zand
lijdenswegen in de maalstroom
waar de wroeging hen veracht

mistige kerktoren hoog boven de hemel
als een misbeeld van et geloof
geen hand voor ogen, geen grond in zicht
en geen zon die mij verlicht
vazalen, tempelieren, miskramen en schavuiten
verlaten et leven en bevaren de kajuiten
betaal de oude man en zing een lied als je kan
Andes doolt gij voor eeuwig als een schim in de maalstroom

De veerman neemt u mee
Naar de poort van kreberos
Waar geen nectar ambrozijn of adem is
Obolen op uw ogen
Voor Charon te vergoeden
Wees welkom in et donk're schimmenr(Instrumental)Mountains of madness, fret-darkened sky
Deepest suffering of your mind

Sprinkles of ice are piercing my eyes
Winter drought to every bone rooted in
Aeons ago, frozen cold has cut my inner shield
Son of man, fate of rich sacrifice
Fight my friend when giants rise from the caves
Light your fire when tyrants are at the gates
A tribute to our venerated elders
Wonderful place on the warrior's trail

The moisture of trees, their wisdom was drained
Fire blazed up, glory was burnt
Where wind blows, punishment was coming forth
I have touched the soil, break the lore

Bleeding for a warm dime
Every day curing wounds
Until fire will return sun
Statues shall see, when strength returns to me

Sprinkles of ice are piercing my eye
Winter drought to every bone rooted in
Aeons ago frozen cold has cut my inner shield
Son of man, fate rich of sacrifice
Fight my friend when giants rise from the caves
Light your fire when tyrants are a the gates
A tribute to our venerated elders
Wonderful place on the warrior's trailWithering and as ugly as sin
What's right or wrong
Who am I to tell?

This dreadful sight
This atrophied body
It is me, lying on the ground

Needless flowers of speech
I cannot endure this shape
Needless flowers of speech
But they can't see inside of me

My own mind...
My mind is my prison
I have lost touch with reality

Mental breakdown: the insight, then the fall
And now deadness is ubiquitous

They dissect me without understanding
...Only a disease
Not a human being

Needless flowers of speech
I cannot endure this shape
Needless flowers of speech
But they can't see inside of me

My own mind...
My mind is my prison
I have lost touch with reality

I can resist my inner demons
I drown in the sea of forgiveness
But somehow I die with thirst

My own mind...
My mind is my prison
I have lost touch with reality

My own mind...
My mind is my prison
I have lost touch with reality(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hordes of faces
Empty eyes
I see nothing new
Seasoned schemes of slimy curs
Offer up their flu
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you
Am I demon
You need to know
Faces of a million hells
Rage inside these veins
Pounding out desrved pain
To anyone in need
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you
Am I demon
Need to know
Am I demon
Need to know
Every world
And every limb
Torn asunder base
Everything I need is me
Everything I am
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you
Am I demon
You need to know
Am I demon
Need to knowWatch'em floating in the night
Animas who don't realizee deads
The hiss of  igniis fatus
Call a myriad of bats

Sometimes they appear in dreams
Or so dreadful in countryside
In this limbo trmbling with fear
Animas who grieved caress they grave
Dead children cries from the coffins
Spectres who suddenly move things
Defuncts through ruins

Sometimes they speak in dreams
Revealing mysterious facts
Infusing cold in soul

Deads summon back,by necromancy
Candles...violet drapes
Broken urns,bones and skulls
Anima...disincarnata

...you can see unburieds roams
Near the corpse...
Tormented by the slime ghosts
Of the abyss...
Voices in the smelly damp
Ossuary...(Instrumental)Let me go and I will be fresh wind ,
To touch your hand at dawn,
overcoming kilometers
Forever be with your soul together.

Take me out of the broken body
Let me forget about the fear of parting .
Never before did not want to
Crush a lights of desires.

I have no luck in this shell.
And in eyes that burned with tears
You will not see dying fire ,
You will not see horrific emptiness .

Death is not salvation and not the end
Not the end of the novel that we are writing.
I will get up from my knees until
until death divides soul from the body.

I will die and I will be fresh wind ,
Having filled pages of the book of fate,
I will overcome miles,
And I will be with you forever .(Instrumental)As I stand at rhe temple at Sounion
I gaze upon the sea
Behold the throne of Poseidon
Eternal, wild and free

The wind blows, holds secrets
To the ancient war methods
The Athenian fleet burned
The persians at Salamis !

Apollo's sun burns bright in the sky
As I journey in the heat
To find the gates of fire
Where 300 fought off thousands

Their bronze still shines in
The gleam of the sun
The Gods in the ancient sky
Witnessed the might of the Spartans !

The spirit is one with the blood
The ocean, the sky and the sun
HELLENIC WARSPIRIT, conquerors for milleniums(Instrumental)Cold was the winter when my father gave me my first sword.
Steel and wind they nearly froze my hands.
But I was so eager to learn and fight the cold was of no 
matter to me.
I fought for the proud look of my father the most important thing in my life.

I grew stronger and skilled in the art of the sword.
I was ready to fight my first battle so father took me on raiding.
I had no care for gems and gold I wanted to smell the blood and see fear in the eyes of my enemy.

Experience the kill.
Then came the great war. The time had come to serve my king. I prayed to Wodan for courage and a brave death when my time has come.

We went in great ships and gathered at the island.
We stormed the enemies camp at night, our faces painted white and red. Blood flowed in mighty streams as if the earth itself was wounded.
Many brave men they sadly died that night.

The cold it froze my limbs and a stinging wound tormented me.
The second night we attacked again. That night I saw my father die. I remember how tears took my sight but my father's spirit guided my hands. We killed many that night!
Our king betrayed us! He collaborated with christian dogs and forced upon us the faith of merciless cowards!

I killed my king that night! Now I can never return home, but I still have my pride, my brothers and gods!
And I still carry with me, my father's sword!Everlasting valleys
cut through giants of stone.
Times don't harm your mountains
nor your grimly spirit.

I walk on the top, my dear home below.
Neither stormwind nor ice will bend
nor invading scum from overseas
will stain the glory of the past.

You enclose me while nightfall,
guide my spirit through the times,
guard the door of the great hall
where our brothers may dwell.

Let's raise the swords buried deep into the mines
to show the cruelty of our ore.
My brothers side by side - united we stand
proud of our roots - Erzgebirge.Er komt een nacht waarin maan noch ster de hemel verlichten zal met donkere stralen van rouwig onlicht
De wereld in diepe rouw ter gedachtenis aan de heksenvrouw

Herrijs uit stil graf en aarde rust,
proef de wind van een vergeten dageraad
Niet het zonlicht beschijnt uw graf,
maar het verwoestend heidens vuur

De gloed van haat, het vuur van wraak
We smeden ons staal in de vlammen van toorn!

Moeder der heksen, moeder des levens
Uw onvergetelijke pijn zal worden gewroken!
Kosmische winden hoor ons aan en laat het recht zegevieren
Een cirkel van kracht beschermt ons allen sereen tezamen gekomen
Takkenwoud verhult ons wel,
een wens een vloek neemt het vuur mee

Voor alle verbrande heksen, voor alle verwoeste plaatsen
Voor zovele eeuwen van goddeloze Christelijke haat!


Draugluin ' 99A shore...and the shore brings an ocean
Bathed by the trees of an endless forest
That stands like the gods of old
On the road once they forgot
Now from above a glance guards the land

Upon the sky covered by a curtain of darkness
The lord of the nightskies fly on and on

A night...and the night brings a legend
And one name...Shamhain
Eve of witchcraft and fires at midnight
Night of lust and pagan rites

Upon the sky, throughout the trees wisthles the wind that
Helps the barn owl to advance

A folk, communed with the night
A spell that shall forever be alive
And will bring our blood beyond the night (In the eternal night)
And into dark woods and dark hearts will dwell

Upon the time, legends were lost and then were found
Hidden where only we can findI sit down in front of the hollow screen 
Well prepared for this procedure 
Long time I've waited for this in my dream 
Now I begin my coadventure 

I connect myself to the machine 
Begin to feel the data stream transmitting 
Bits and bytes transformed to a soft impulse 
Building up an image - my new living 

Oh does that look great! 
Let me see what I can do now! 

You can create 
You can change fate 
You can be your God 

Fading sorrow 
Your own world 
Self-discovery 
Progress 
The price is paid 

As I enter this brand-new site 
I begin to install my controlling tower 
Streets and houses are planted without effort 
Company founding - one man-hour 

More and more customer satisfaction achieved 
This city will be build exactly in a day 
Then I will reach my desired goal 
And outplay the best in history 

The price is paid! 
the service must be performed! 

The price is paid, the service performed 
This place is mine, I can do what I want 

Infinte possibilities 
Illusions raised 

- Your world, your imagination -I see around me the sparks of life
The power to rebuild and avoid the mistakes of the past

Here comes a new kind of men who respect nature ant the pagan spirit
This is the rise of a new age, a new chance for Mankind, a new seed of life

In the first day of this new world old survivors rise and say that
"We must now erase the proofs of the past of the ancient world"

The power to rebuild and avoid the mistakes of the past(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Weide Deinen Leib 
an den Fluten der Gegenwart,
im Antlitz Deiner Zeit,
am Grunde der Unendlichkeit

Gestern ist ein Schatten
verblassender Erinnerung
Morgen nur ein Schimmer
am fernen Horizont

Weide deine Seele 
an den Fluten der Gegenwart,
im Antlitz Deiner Zeit,
am Grunde der Unendlichkeit

Achte Deiner Zeit,
ein Leben ist genug
Tauche tief hinein
in staunende Lebendigkeit

Weide Deinen Geist 
an den Fluten der Gegenwart,
im Antlitz Deiner Zeit,
am Grunde der UnendlichkeitWhile the barley of Huginn
Lies unburried still;
Their bones picked clean by ravens
The liberator of Germania was betrayed

Wuotan gives and Wuotan takes!

A fate worse than death was her share
Thusnelda, a trophy for Germanicus
So Thumelicus was born
A slave of noble blood ...

Wuotan gives and Wuotan takes!

Able to meet his end
with the fire of Wuotan
clenched firmly in his hand;
the final path to Valhalla
There is no place for personal fame
There is only the thread spun by the maidens
Who dwell by the well of Urd
Steering your fate, towards glory or disgrace...i penetrate your open orifice with steel.
such sadistic tendencies must make you despise me.
i sever mine own phallus with glass.
do i threaten you?I will return
Im a creature of the night
I am a vampire
And I bite
At night I will come to your house

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself

I will bite into your neck
To suck your blood
Out of your vein
Soon you will be dead

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself

Stick a pale into my heart
Then you have saved of your life just a part
Hear my evil symphony

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourselfSunrise here we go
To start the show
Arrows let them rise
The springtime comes
Leda now you rule
We hail to you
Sunrise spirit comes
It's born by you

Rising Arrows

Master here you are
The Radiant
We are looking for
A light of your land
Arrows let them rise
Into the skies
Fire in my eyes
I see your shine

Rising ArrowsThe knife slides into your brain corroding again and again
I can't believe it, it's all the same
Don't wanna hear it, twice the pain

Holocaustic deafening

Same trash falls in your face exploding with no taste
I can't believe it, it's all the same
Don't wanna hear it, twice the pain

Holocaustic deafening

Look out! one final time someday you'll pay for this crime
I can't believe it, it's all the same
Don't wanna hear it, twice the pain

Holocaustic deafeningIt was a cold dawn so pure
when the seeds were sown
her skin moaned scars
my daughter wedded with rot
she was purified through flames

But decay claimed her soul
faith vigilance breeding
as November invited starvation
our morning widows

They laid with pestilence

Chivalry drowned in blood
These borrowed ephemeral moments
under the aegis of horned deities

I ushered brethren to their rest
jewels of lost faith beneath me
numerous like masked stars above
falling white shrouded their memory

No kindred to bury my husk
allegiant venom burning deep
obeisance never crowns my grave

Plague that spred through northI've stared into the flames
Of ancestral memories
Emerging myself within
My unconscious
With scarred eyes I've seen
The light and the darkness
My gods are true and pure
Once forgotten and now remembered
My honour commands loyalty
Voices of divinity grasp me
Into the ranks of the chosen warriors
Emerge!
Moral guardians of earth
Fight for your homeland
Stand and emerge.... For warFaces fall off
All barriers down
It's time to confront her
She sees right through me
Deduction the lies
Expecting an answer

I can't find the words
a blank page in my mind
There's no easy way
I feel my heart burn
Cold sweat in my hands
I can't deny how it feels

For the first time 
I'm letting you go

Scream in silence 
Screaming violence
Worlds apart
Scream in silence 
Screaming violence
Defining our hearts

Feeling the surface 
No more disguise
I'm nearing the end 
Taking the final step
To be cleansed
To be humanized

So, I'm letting myself down again
But the truth is I never cared

Scream in silence 
Screaming violence
Worlds apart
Scream in silence 
Screaming violence
Defining our hearts

Trust in night 
Seek to hide
Trust in darkness
Curse the light
Trust in no one
I close my eyes(Instrumental)Dive your hand in the lake of shadow
seeking the pleasure you've never had
Oval mirrors of the truth will show
your real face you've been hiding for ages
Your unequivocal personality
demands you appease cruel soul of yours
Desirous of purgative suffering
seat of serpents from paradise expelled
Masochistic soul
Vampire come to me
Masochistic soul
Plunge your sharp teeth

Flog me, flog me hard please, use this uncommon whip
By the sweat of your brow let my desire grow
Put on your leather clothes, be aggressive, unbridled oh
Hold this tireless whip tight, it has soaked in my blood

Chain me to the bed, be naughty, be real bad
Tighten those cords on my legs, temptation says more, she begs
Make our unrestrained lust blend and my body will rend
When you drive in your nails into my chest

Lash me lash me hard please, be an unity with the whip
Flow softly, slowly in the air, then fall absolutely (faster)
Hit me sorely that I'm hurt, wound of scream has opened
Kill me - this is my last wish, satisfy me - do it for my relish

Gravediggers are dragging coffin with the corpse
Funeral pyre is burning, in fire is the cross

And there she is embracing the grave, grinding her claws on the tombstone
Preparing the way into heart of fire where her lover devil's enthroned
Now she will take me to her world - undying world of deathless life
And I'll go to her unfreezing world and I'll stay in her thorny arms

Coming down to the gates of hell, Feeling hot, pleasure and pain
Ecstasy tears my bleeding mind, Devil's whore, Heaven's bride

Her ravenblack beautiful hair smells so well in the air
I didn't even suppose when she stifled the cross
That source of her never ending life - blood being sucked from thousand veins
Brings such an unspeakable pleasure... Sadist's been born this way in me

Sadistic soul - I can give you pain
Sadistic soul - Vampire princess my love
Sadistic soul - I will open your veins
Sadistic soul - All before the day

I will lay my head on your thighs my dear, I will suck you out.
I will bring you misery my dear... All this until the light.

Night used to be my love some day - for her grace I implored.
Now I am possessed by the sadism beyond the night adored"Erzittre Welt, ich bin die Pest,
Ich komm' in alle Lande..."


Based on Hermann von Lingg`s poem "Der schwarze Tod".Water and salt is giving birth 
 A true power from the depths of the earth 

 There is a cycle, there is a chain 
 We're are the followers, who wait for the pain. 

 Dying in the oceans 
 Full of emotions 
 The nature is calling 
 A creature is falling 

 A new beggining is the way to a drama. 
 The sickness is life, the sadness is karma. 

 An eternal hunting between death and life 
 Cannot bring a change. This is the fire. 

 Dying in the oceans 
 Full of emotions 
 The nature is calling 
 A creature is falling 

 Feel the waves of power 
 Become a drop and fall from the tower 
 Cannot escape from destiny 
 If you could fall, you could walk to eternity.Awakening of paganism
                      Do you see the frozen nature?
                      Do you see the mirror on ice?
                               Yes I see...
                     I see the ravens in black sky...

                          To feel fire of war...
                    I see the burning man with horn -

                God of sunlight, God of life & reality...
                          This God lives in me -

                        And he dies every night...
                        Khors will come to shine,
                       My soul will see the light,

            One day the nature of our ancestors shall rebirth!
                    I will burn the flame, one day...
                        And SunGod, listen to me -
                  light your powerful flame, and please,

Nobody seems to be here
Black ice covers the floods
Cursed the count, show no fear
The knives of revenge are waiting to kill
At darkest night the blood to spill
Enemies are slaughtered, never to be found
Their mutilated bodies buried in the winterly ground
See fear in their eyes 
Thats the reward for your lies
Your fuckin hearts I pull to pieces
I love your death screams sound
I broke your bones and cracked your heads
The Pagan madness heres around
I eat your guts and soak your blood
The first time it colours the snowy ground
First winter of bloodred snow
Victory for us or the grave below
First winter of bloodred snow
Join the Pagan killer show!!!Don't you go down without a fight
Don't you forget what stayed behind
Stay strong, carry on
You'll see our kingdom burning
If you fall, it was all for nothing 
Give meaning to our sacrifice 
If no one pays this price, all is lost, all for nothing
I have faith in you, though your task is hard 
Know that all their joy will turn to ash tomorrow
In order to build a new, perfect world
We first have to destroy the old one
That's the only way, it is the will of the gods
Stay strong, carry on
You'll see our kingdom burning
If you fall, it was all for nothing 
Give meaning to our sacrifice 
If no one pays this price, all is lost, all for nothing
In your hands now 
Tools to build a new world
This world shall be cleansed by fire
All pain and corruption will be gone
And from its ashes shall rise a new, pure, flawless one
Stay strong, carry on
You'll see our kingdom burning
If you fall, it was all for nothing 
Give meaning to our sacrifice 
If no one pays this price, all is lost, all for nothing
All for nothing!
Chosen one, lizard king
Unleash the dragon kin
Fire-breath, wings of death
Gods of destruction
Burning hearts, for revenge
They will pay the price we paid
Tenfold, Invincible
We will rule forever
In your hands now
Tools to build a new worldWar or death
birth or marriage
rite of passage
the dead will listen before burial
lamentations begin before funeral

the body of a sinless white
wishing reincarnation as a swan

called as a living body
kept in the cabin on the board for two days
talked and sang
weeper sitting on a stool at the head of the body
and to keep the cloth in hands
sometimes with eyes
sometimes in front of the mouth 
wondering of the deceased to live and remain in silence
dressed in white for departure
wake up cry begins at midnight
pondering why the deceased doesn't rise
lamentations for the coffin maker
what is created can only
lead to one assumption... death

on the third day saying goodbyes to the dead
the coffin was raised and all the chairs
in the house were repealed

funeral cries with hopes of a ease for the spirit to rise
no stones
just leaves on top and a small
hole from the surface to the coffin
so that the spirit may have passage

after the burial weepers come and look for the dead
behind the shed
in the woods 
then look for inside a house 
perhaps arrived as a bird to home before others
no more cries on the funeral meal...I was born in the shadows of darkness
I was born in a blackened chasm
I was born by an angel
:the angel of hell!!
Am I the son of Satan
Am I the source of evil
Am I the only one with horns?
Am I the lord of chaos?
IF I seek will I find my strength
Oh, Satan take me where I can find my will
I turn the cross towards hell
Give me thy benediction to destroy all holy
In your name...

Infernus spiritus Tiamat
In nomine Satanas
Nocternus spiritus marduk
Dominus spiritus Satan

Ego vos benedictio in nomine
Magni dei nostri satanas ave
Satanas domini inferni

I spread my wings and fly into the night again
And create confusion and chaos for my unholy immolation
In nomine dei nostri satanas
I raise my horns into the night again
Take my hand and fly with me into the flaming hell

Can you feel his pride upon us
Can you feel his strength are growing
Rapture!!!Do you see the people all in fear?
do you feel the shadows coming near?
do you know it's all a hopeless fight?
do you hear the rush of the coming tide?

And when it's time do you know where you can hide?

Do you see our world falls to decay?
do you know we're going all astray?
do you feel the heat of the burning land?
do you see the chaos in which we'll end?

And when it's time are you still able to stand?

When all who you know have all gone
and you alone must carry on
when all that you have has no more worth
what is your purpose here on earth?

And if these times of darkness will come
if the moon eclipses the sun
if a tide breaks into the land
this is the dawn of the end!IIch weiss, ich bin nicht fair,
ich weiss, ich verletze
Ich weiss, ihr hasst mich,
Ich weiss, ihr hasst mich,

ich weiss, ich bin nicht volkommen
Ich weiss, das ist niemand.
Ich weiss, ich mache Fehler.
Ich weiss, ich mache Fehler.

Ich weiss, ich habe Freunde.
Ich weiss, nicht mehr lange.
Ich weiss, mach ich so weiter,
bin ich allein.

Ich weiss, nicht sehr viel.
Ich weiss aber genug.
Ich weiss, was ihr nicht wisst.
Ich weiss, ich bin verwirrt.

Du gehst Deinen eigenen Weg, ich geh meinen.
Gehen wir "zusammen" ist keiner mehr allein.
Helfe mir, ich helfe Dir.
(x3)Dawn, the sun will rise in silence
Pouring down its blazing light on the shades of the world

Now that I've walked in the cold through the misty forests
Frostbitten in my heart and my soul
Now that I've followed the wings of the Ravenlord all night long
Now that I've climbed to the highest mountains
At the gates of the passage leading to the clouds
I have arrived to the top of the world to be enraptured by the dawn

The frozen moors slumber in obscurity, awaiting the morning sun
Daylight in nordic and azure infinity, thou rise

Now that I've walked in the cold through the misty forests
Frostbitten in my heart and my soul
Now that I've followed the wings of the Ravenlord all night long
Now that I've climbed to the highest mountains
At the gates of the passage leading to the clouds
I have arrived to the top of the world to be enraptured by the dawn

The nordic dawn shines through the dormant woods
As the mist disappears
Daylight in nature and peaceful infinity, thou rise

Swamps are bathed in nordic rays
The dream of one brave man was to embrace this precious dawn, O'MineBlack clouds appear in the sky 
Hide the sun
Snow freezes the fields and brings the death
Terrifying shadows haunt the whole north
The nine Kingdoms doomed to the end

The tree of life burns on its base
In the signs of war about the dark
Under flag of war all the north
Odin calls all realms for the clash

Oceans violently
Drowns the north
The snake overflows the seas to the lands
Spewing its deadly poison
Everywhere
Pests contaminate warriors

The tree of life burns on its base
In the signs of war about the dark
Under flag of war all the north
Odin calls all realms 

The gods fought with honor for existence
Forever die for this world
The heroes fall with honor for existence
Forever die for this world

The burning tree
Warriors gather from all over the north
The master falls before the jaws of the wolf
The flame of Ragnarok swallows all the kingdoms 
Is the fall of the heroes

The tree of life burns on its base
In the signs of war about the dark
Under flag of war all the north
Odin calls all realms

The gods fought with honor for existence
Forever die for this world
The heroes fall with honor for existence
Forever die for this worldI see the bad moon arising.

I see trouble on the way.

I see earthquakes and lightnin'.

I see bad times today.

CHORUS:

Don't go around tonight,

Well, it's bound to take your life,

There's a bad moon on the rise.

I hear hurricanes ablowing.

I know the end is coming soon.

I fear rivers over flowing.

I hear the voice of raze and ruin.

CHORUS

All right!

Hope you got your things together.

Hope you are quite prepared to die.

Looks like we're in for nasty weather.

One eye is taken for an eye.

CHORUS

CHORUS(Instrumental)Under the cover of darkness we ride
Nothing to be spared, only ashes and flames
Fulfilling the will of my gods
Purification from the scourge (eternally)

Black is the night
Dark our way (towards the night)

Wraith in me...
The hunger for devastation (against them)
Desecration reigns supreme (in their holy temples)

My heart, it cries for vengeance in my fathers name
Pain that rottens inside... (and shall never give me peace)as do they pass only winters 
as a summers after the time 
as don't be you nevermore 
heap up blind's forces that the world 

in you conscience 
you scream - "i forget"... 

you heal your ill soul 
it begines next act of 
cruel dramas. you coward 
look on destruction 
you hide a hope 
as a gem. under feet 
earth she falling through 
look of destruction 

soul from body withdraw herself 
sun of life sets it and she rejoice 

in you conscience 
you scream - "i forget"... 

as someone forgot 
soul from body withdraw herselfYou speak of good and evil, 
As if they exist, 
These judgments of perception, 
That is all it is. 

You speak of right and wrong, 
As if there's only one, 
Many paths to the same conclusion, 
This is what I've found. 

There is no right way,
Been corrupted by wrong, 
All good people, 
Much evil have they done.

I've given up on humankind, 
I care not for these fools, 
Turned and walked away, 
Let them suffer in this world. 

I've gathered those I care about, 
Packed up what I can, 
Count me out of your pseudo revolution

This is where I stand. 
This is where I Stand!(Instrumental)...In a old place of mighty
To call the rain...
A child and his skull
Lay down upon the altar
Among slightering serpents
Symbols of knowledge

This is ancient ritual
Gods demands blood
Blood who allow us...the life

Skulls now lay down
On the consacrated mud
Wizard summon winds
Shut in cave dungeons
And cut the child's throat
Sddenly heavy rainfall

Thunders crush the sky...it'
lashing...
For our prosperity

Bloodshed in tophet
Mediterranean rites circles
Against demons drought

12 skulls,Blood & Serpents

Another Black Metal whip!!!(Instrumental)Slash, cut, steaming in blood
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Cleave, slash, bleeding flesh
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Stab, maim, rabid dogs
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Rip, kill, croaking throes
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods

Crack, break, breaking bones
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Split, crush, dripping gore
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Tear, gash, open wounds
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Smash, hew, spilling guts
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods

Fire, burn, searing flesh
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Scorch, choke, boiling blood
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Roast, scald, smoking hair
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods
Rage, gall, charred remains
Behold the feast of
The slaughter Gods

I clasp the hand
Of my warrior Queen
'Neath a sky cold and pale
Unearthly winds
Stir and sigh
In this mournful farewell
Like naked souls
At judgement morn
Lost in death's night
To reap the harvest
Of bleak despair
veiled by radiance bright

We Gods of thunder,
Take faces
In a phantom mist
Shapes of terror,
In death we exist

Can you see the dead
In the fleshless mists
Of winter's icy veil,
This is what war does
To shroud the land
With a wrinkling frost
That cuts into the hollow guts
Of the earth
Fettered by clay,
Cold irons to the very heart of darkness
And the ripples of the dying
Fade into reeking silenceThe sun is fading into black 
The night dictates my way to feel
Cloaked by history's dusty gown
Old myths appear to me so real

From the ruins, ancient shadows crawl to greet the dawning day
Never heard of, never noticed, the sunlight soon wipes them away

Out of gloomy, haunted keeps tales were told, but never heard
Stories of forgotten times, but no-one wants to read these words

Fairy-tales of merry dances, 'neath the silver full moon's face
Nothing now remains, but memories of the glorious Pagan days

The Earth Mother's sucklings starving on her wrinkled bosom lie
A crone in ragged mourning gown, waiting for her time to die

Children of the mighty ash-tree, world-encircling Yggdrasil
Everlasting leaves have withered, ageless wood has ceased to be

Sun-God Lug, thy rays were burning - say, which raincloud covered thee?
Are thy warriors really beaten by those who love their enemies?

The Horned Hunter sounds the bugle for all heathens' funeral march
As they pass in chains, with heads bowed under Christ's triumphal arch

Subjects to the Pain-Emperor, servants to the thorn-crowned king
Oppressed 'neath the Usurper's throne in eternal suffering

An Anthem to those
Who have been nailed to the Cross
And left there for aeons forgottenEguna, Briwo
Kant-abr, Balcos, Galeus
Silom kwu Kandamos
Vindium deiwos
Sego!Run through the forest 
entwined
Scattering wings
Lost in the dark

Hunted by nightmares
Spectres of true death
Now smelling blood squeal 
and bark

Slip free out of the old trees
Clearing of earth
Last of the sun

Wand scribes in dirt
Circle of sanctum
All that is false be undone

Chorus

Bind this circle in shadows
By rite of pact
To my will be wed

Close this circle of shadows
Breath of the living
Voice of the dead
 
Cursing stopped at the rings 
edge
Horrors' sharp wail
Thwarted they rave

One of them speaks
Sniffing the air
This ward is breached by a 
grave

Chorus

Hidden under the soft ground
Mortals' bare grave
Lies under my seal

Bones of the dead
Long safe below
Now shine in twilight 
revealed

Obscene ghouls begin howling
Over their fear
My spell is spoiled

I brace for death
But as they come

 
See corpses climb from the soil

Chorus

Bodies stand forming a circle
Palor of wax
Colder than snow

We are called
Out from the shadows
Evil outcast this circle we 
close

Chorus(Instrumental)No more vengeance, no more pain
I know your soul bleeds again
I know I've lost the game this time
Because your fear is mine...

Somewhere between night and day
I witness your light fading away
That look in your eyes is trying to reach me
While the demons tear you away

Please... come back... again
I'm lost... without you

Please come back into the light
We'll embrace your soul tonight
We can still make things right
All grief will fade away

No more vengeane no more pain
All hate is quiet again
And as my soul yearns for peace
I know I've lost you againBetween mountains
My spirit flies free
And sings the sound
Of my forefathers

In the battle filed heard
Thousand voices from
My forefathers

Whose guides me through
One more victory in the battle
From my forefathers(Instrumental)Far from beyond the humans' wrath
Caught by the spirits holding hands
Wandering on the icy paths
I hail the whitest lands

Invaded by this timeless infinity
Gazing at the shades surrounding
I enjoy the silent show you offer me
Above benighted souls arising

Summoned by peace, quiescence and( pure majesty
Drag me where the fullmoon enlightens the snow
You are the wizard and i am your servant
May i be there for endless times

The purity of your white creation
Among the deep landscapes of humanity
Comforts me with the strength of salvation
Against the darkest enemy

What can i reach beyond white plains?
Forever seeking the essence of mine
Blessed among the cursed forever stained
I will walk on the paths of thine

You are the wizard
And i am your servantBreak down all the walls
It's time for violence tonight
I've seen your Lord fall
Now the rest of you are in my sight
Killing and looting and hatred
Burning and bleeding and rape
This is all that's coming
This will soon be here tonight!
Your kind is through with the power of Satan
We'll take on the world and bring back true evil
White hot fire is all that I see
White hot fire for all eternity
As midnight strikes the city's in flames
The dead they will rise to stake their claim
It's a total disaster no one will get out alive
Serve to me as your master it's the night of long knives
To serve your Heavens it gives me disgust
To burn on this earth it gives me such lust
There's no tomorrow just wait and see
Your Dog has failed you now he's ruled by meBefore the storm
Before the shadows will swallow the sun
One last glance and I'll be gone
One last song upon my sword

Before the war,
Before this vision of beauty be gone
Suddendly silence falls
And just before the charge
Your mind is blank, but you
Follow the beat of your heart
Echoes of fear will call
Out to your very soul
Leaving you lost
Lost in the eye of the storm

Strong winds run cold
Across the hilltops 
Through long manes of gold
One last day and we'll be gone
One last stand before we fall

After the storm
After the shadows have captured the sun
Down on the valley's end
We die with sword in hand
Feeding the fire
That slowly devours the soul
Victories lost and found
Upon a bloodstained ground
High on the mound
Where torches eternally glowI've got filthy habits
I've got to have my lust
Reach down and grab it
It's something you can trust
She's born to please don't care about disease
She's born to please and brings me to my knees
Endless slut she's got what I want
Endless slut she knows how to use it
Time's getting nearer
Devil's daughter takes control
There's nothing to fear
As she sucks my soul
The deed is done
And she's had her way
I'm Satan's son
And she's one hell of a lay(Instrumental)Oh, warriors
of brave souls.

 I see invasion of clear mind 
 Awaken ghosts of renaissance 
 the key of wisdom lies behind 

 All natural beauty shines again 
 The scripts have risen from the dust 
 And celebration of Insane 
 Is gone away to tecnopast 

 I declorate New Age of Man 
 The renaissance of God in flesh 
 Altar of Pride Will rise again 
 embodiment of plebeian crash 

 All mystics of the human mind 
 Reborn from chaos of the faith 
 doctrines of rotten church denied 
 The only law is might and grace 

 The walls of Babylon rebuilt 
 And towers grow to reach the skies 
 Renewal by supernal wilt 
 After millenium of lies 

 I declorate New Age of Man 
 The renaissance of God in flesh 
 Altar of Pride Will rise again 
 embodiment of plebeian crash 

 Awake! 

 Perceived Divinity of being 
 Which holds the power to create 
 Revolted mind will spread the wings 
 To be the masters is Our fate(Instrumental)Attack the holy make them die in pain
We'll rape your virgin whores again and again
Call forth the demons, wizards and blasphemy
We need no reason to let our spirits free
with cross held high
They'll bring the blood we'll bring the fire
We'll make them see their god is the liar
Call forth the violators, mistresses and all
We'll take the holy down and watch them fall
with cross held highSolen svartnar...(Instrumental)And I hear voice from space
Theatre of dead shadows
Cold as burnt out candle
Trapped in human bodies (then)

And I hear voice of earth
Screaming children of the night
Creeping worshipers of moon
Steps of approaching foresters...
They're coming!

Deadly human shadows!
Fleeting cloud of fear!
Children of the night!

Deadly human shadows
Fleeting cloud of fear
Children of the night
Screaming worshipers of moon

Burning hordes from above
Fire of damnation burns
Bloody waves of merciless flood
Are coming, are coming!

And I hear burning hordes
Shining with hellfire
Coming from eternal pain
Born from their desire

And I hear Devil's voice
Laughing from their fate
Purity of mad innocence
Is now to be destroyed

Deadly human shadows
Fleeting cloud, fleeting cloud of fear
Children of the night
Mad moon, mad moon lights 

Burning hellish hordes
Fire burns, fire burns in souls
Bloody waves of flood
They will come, they will come very soon.

And I hear human yells
Crying of despair
Captured in their own cells
Suffering from eternal pain

And I hear shouts at night
Screams of terrified ones
Moon has just risen
To meet his deadly crowd 

Deadly human shadows
Fleeting cloud, fleeting cloud of fear
Children of the night
Mad moon, mad moon lights

Burning hellish hordes
Fire burns, fire burns in souls
Bloody waves of flood
They will come, they will come very soon!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)once when many ghastly wars
were desolating seas and lands,
blood red turned rivers and lands
jeopardized were home and peace.
numberless arose the invasions
riding fiercely from uncharted lands
to plunder and burn every realms
and crush down our own belief and gods.

by Freya and Thor we thank you to be born
through eternity we will trust in your fate,
rooted in our heart oh eternal brave warrior.

like a wave alone in the sea
crushing wildly against a rocky cliff
you keep moving on your grim aim
provide your enemies with grief and death.
through constant obstinacy and wisdom
you spread great awe around our kingdom,
far beyond the path of mortals
your bravery defeats fear to fall.(Instrumental)Mightiest am I, but I am not alone in this cosmos of mine 
For the black hills consists of black souls, souls that already died one 
thousand deaths 
Behind the stone walls of centuries they breed their 
black art 
Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold 
Far up in the mountains, where the rain fall not far, yet the sun cannot reach 
The wizards, my servants, summon the souls of macrocosm 
No age will escape my wrath 
I travel through time and I return to the future 
I gather wisdom now lost 
I visit again the eternally ancient caves 
before a mighty Emperor thereupon came Watching the mortals "discovering" my chronicles 
guarded by the old demons, even unknown 
to me 
Once destroyed their souls are being summoned to my timeless prison of hate 
It is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls 
that was destroyed in my future 
How many wizards that serve me with evil I know not 
My empires has no limits 
From the never ending 
mountains black, to the bottomless lakes 
I am the ruler and has been for eternity's long 
My wizards are many, but their essence is 
mine 
Forever there are in the hills in their stone homes of 
grief 
Because I am the spirit of their existence 
I am them.(Instrumental)Music & Lyrics by
Pierre -Luc Paquin

Magician specialized in human manipulation
You are exactly the opposite of brotherhood
Now center your orbits on the universe you shall create
Cause an imminent disaster is in sight

Thrusting deeper & deeper the knife
Rejoycing yourself at the world outcome you're devasting
Leaded as a puppets in chains
Using your powers on our existence

This last piece is the cause of all wounds
The clan of bards have master pieced our sequestration

The opus of those virtuosos,
A prestation without compassion.
The opus of those virtuosos,
The action of degeneration.

My Mother Earth withdraw her bows from our violins
My Mother Earth stops this concerto in eternal crescendo

Selfishness has possessed your corpse 
And It has inserted his principles,
Of polymorphed egocentrism.
I feel my mortality showing up.

The tempo is rising
and leaves me In never ending sufferingsSpirit born of this world 
as an ageless oak afeith my soul to land and sky 
we stand to defend, no enemy walk upon our sacred ground 
no foe to tear these roots of pride 
to stand and fight 

yet not forgotten.... 

As echos of battle, we ride on forth 

Spirit of dying elm 
from whence I came, I shall return to these skies of fire 
we stand to defend, no enemy walk upon our sacred ground 
with fire burning in our eyes 
stand, fight and die 

(instrumental section) 

Stand... 
look not upon the growing storm 
face... 
with honor thy fate... 

(instrumental section) 

When all is lost 
and countless lives cast asunder 
face the realm 
now fields of orchids in the blood red dawn 
no pride in wasted lives 
our land soaked in blood 
as spirits to wander the earth(Instrumental)Now is the time to change my ways
Claw my way out of this wretched fucking grave
My corpse arises, embrace the darkened sky
A chilling spectral wind bites at my peeling flesh

An endless sea of headstones shrouded in ghastly fog
I feel I am myself, not fully in control
Voices speaking ancient tongues resound in my head
A silhouette in smoke emerges 
Breath of decay, green glowing eyes transfix
Me, where I stand
The sorcerer calls out to me
There is no escape, you're trapped for eternity

I'm out of time to change my ways
Now that I've dug myself a deeper fucking grave
Deceitful Magic guides me through this realm
I feel the burning touch of the sorcerer's spell

I will release you from your failed existence
I will deliver you from pain
All are conditioned here to suffer eternally
If not for me then someone else, I am not to blame(I get into the...) forests...

The Search, the seek for vast universes,
millenniums through evolving journeys
by occult ways
in search of wisdom.

The pagan blood running into my veins never
extinguishes the old ways flames
of ancient times in my brave heart.

To the battle, noble hosts of pagan warriors!!!
Through our Paganheart we'll dethrone with courage,
by the (hot) fire and by the (cold) steel,
fighting against those opposing our ideals.

By the magic of our words
and by the strength of our swords
with wisdom we'll fight,
like honored warriors fighting
for the (great) pagan flame!

The Paganheart leads us ahead,
with open chest amongst the battle!

From the top of a hill
(I) look through the horizon
and see the vast infinity of Nature...
And with it my warrior spirit will continue his epic
through other worlds (Through eternal
infinite nebulas of the vast cosmos).Psychopathology - I'm inside your mind
I dig through your future and past - I dissect your soul

Wuotan! Cast your spear!
Over the Vanir host
Wuotan! Cast your spear!
And bring war into the world!

Our soul now awakens
From a deep lethargic sleep
By the light of a new age
This dawn is a call to war!

Their lies are rejected
Nothing can hold us down
We now claim what is ours!

A return to savagery
No longer are we numbed
Broken are the chains
Forged by the chosen few

Our dishonour of the past
Washed away by blood
Gushing from their veins!

Wuotan! Cast your spear!
Over the Vanir host
Wuotan! Cast your spear!
And bring war into the world!Nastupit vremya sumerek i sna

Chertogam chuzhdoj very na krovi.
Tam net priyuta kupolam i hramam
Lish' dremlet krasota rodnoj zari.

Ya ne zovu volhvov na pokayan'e - 
Razlichiya teper' sred' mertvyh net
Pomirit nas zemlya syraya
Soboj pitaya tysyachi kornej.
Dayushchih zhizn' vsemu.It's within reach
Just a few more steps and I'll be free as a bird
Everything's moving on the edge
It takes a little and hopes vanish away
Im at the threshold
Entering the paradise of my wishes
But does future hold for me
I'll just let it flow without worries
So much has changed, so many have left
Chained by the emptiness of everyday
Slaves to cozy homes
I'm still here and the flame of youth is burning
I'm not gonna devote my life to watching TV
To the rat race, feeding my family and humble obedience
I cant make peace with my failure like you, father
Everything I do guides me towards my freedom
Running a risk of drowning in feces
If it doesn't suit you baby, you better go
Pain does not last forever
Out of sight out of mindCross the silence of your sad darkness
Where the spirits roar in pain
A timeless wandering to reach the knowledge...
Too many answers... Too many secrets...
Let me see the path of the gods
What a strange world out of my horizons
Immersed in a beautiful fog of mistress
So cold and pale
A shrine is broken
My chants are nightly screams
Wolves surround the circle of ancestors
And dares me and dares the world with ancient pride
Alone, in this mighty forest
Drowned in a sea of quiet streams
Falling into a distant slumber
I've been giving up to rise again
Howls crown the hymns around
A rebirth from the heart of the goddess
Blessed by the old ground of the fatherland
My home is the throne of her elder wisdom
Ghostly and grey
Marble and pure
Brave and strong
Brave and strongConjure unto me the sorcery
The foul black winds of extinction
The carnal bestial lust of the war-whore
The burning flames of Holocaust

May massacres befall the riddled flock
Let murder rain from allfather's sky
By Aryan will, Aryan warrior's might!
They will forever be thrust on Death's blade

(chorus)
Hail genocide!
Aryan will, Aryan pride
Hail genocide!

I pray to the olden Gods
To send forth legions of hate
That we may stand side by side
In the war against the Jewish plague

Hail genocideIt was fall, the year was nine,
And in the sky there was a sign,
For today there would be war,
Against foreign conquerors, coming from afar.

Germanic leaders met in secrecy
To form an army, to defend their glory,
The enemy thought they were unprepared,
The Germanic army knew that no Roman would be spared.

Arminius
Leader of the army
Arminius
Lead us to victory
Arminius
Defender of our lands
Arminius
It is he, who commands

Now the tribes unsheath their swords,
As the enemy draws near,
Unleash the Germanic hordes,
Upon the Romans that appear.

Now the arrows fly, hear the battle cry,
Many swords are crossed, and many lives are lost.
For our homeland, we will fight until the last breath,
Homewards with victory or to Valhalla in death.

Amidst the battle, the valkyries ride the sky,
In the wake of Germanic onslaught, many Romans die,
Sounds of battle are heard all around,
Arminius and his army stand their ground,
From the battle so glorious,
The Germanic army rises  - victorious!Her ashes burn our eyes
Black lines on solemn faces
Concern'd we are by our necessary deed
Moved by the pathetic begging of the witch.

So cruel our duty, yet so joyful in the Lord!
For Alas! Ye poor sinners there's devils everywhere!

In shades they lurk and on meadows fair.
They may obsess your neighbour, your friend, your lover
For the hearts of the weak are their favour'd lair.

Devils everywhere!

In evil eyes they dwell and in women fair
"As the Devill is a Spirit and a Prince of the ayre
He appeares in many shapes by joyning thickened myst together

And the Devill is cunning.
By drawing out of Teats
He doth really enter the body as reall corporeall substantiall creature and forceth that Creature to his desired ends
Useth the organs of that body to speake withall
To make his compact up" [Matthew Hopkins: The Discovery of witches]
With his hideous agents
The heretic, the heathen, the witch

His genital is sore and scaly
And his semen cold as ice.
Maybe she was stirred by our painful interrogation.

For God's compassion she yell'd
And lo! How mercyful we were!
The burning flames of the stake
May slacken her torture in hell.

"There is no peace," says the Lord, "for the wicked."
[Isaiah 48:22] 
We'll have no peace 'til they are all purged.
"There is no peace," says my God, "to the wicked."
[Isaiah 57:21]
We'll have no peace 'til they all burn.

The wicked are like the troubled sea
Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
[Isaiah 57:20]
We'll have no peace 'til our country is cleansed.
"There is no rest," says the Lord, "for the wicked."
We will not rest 'til ye are all purged.Fly on your broom to no man''s mountain, let
me foresee what tomorrow will bring, bring
me some fluid out of Belial''s fountain, for
I am a witch and for magic I sing:

Volle maan in donkere nacht, oost en zuid en
west en noord, hier zijn wij, wij roepen u,
luister naar ons woord

Wierook zweep mes en koorden, heksenlemmet
met je krachten, kom! op mijn toverworden,
kom tot leven met je machten.

Bij alle kracht van land en zee, bij alle
macht van zon en maan, zoals ik het wil, zo
moet het zijn zoals ik het wil
wordt het gedaan.

We''ll never believe in the wAY oF tHE cROSS,
for we have suffered even more, bring me my
pentagram and iverted cross, it''s the evil
I want to adore.

In silence I sleep, in violence I live, the
secret I keep, and I''ll never give...

Beware for your faults, you''re dead when you
die, for I am a witch, and I''ll live forever
Beware, Beware, Beware...(Instrumental)Horses running so far
Taking you to battle and war
The only thing you have to know
Blood is the only law...

Disciples of Wotan do you hear the call?!
You, Warrior of the North are u ready to walk
All over lands through plains and mountains
Heathen crusade invading stolen domains

Horses running so far
Taking you to battle and war
The only thing you have to know
Blood is the only law...

To lay in Valhalla you must be victorious
Born to be almighty on feeble Christians' dust

Ablaze churches in the northern landscape
Betrayers can run away there is no escape

The foghorns resound in our heads
To drive the hunt once again(Instrumental)Come come to the sabbath 
Down by the ruined bridge 
Witches and demons are coming 
Just follow the magic call 
Come come to the sabbath 
Down by the ruined bridge 
Later on the master will join us 
Called from the heart of Hell 

At first we light up a fire 
And then we hail our Lord 
Two candles, a black and a white 
Are placed upon the altar 
North, south, east and west 
And so we clean the air 
High priestess invoking the Devil 
Infernal names are spoken 

Come to the sabbath...sabbath...sabbath...sabbath 
Come to the sabbath 

The ceremony's proceeding 
It's time to grant your wishes 
An evil curse on the priest 
Who took the life of Melissa 
Now we must close up the ritual 
Read the Enochian key 
And so it will be done 
Amen... now come 

Come to the sabbath...sabbath...sabbath...sabbath 
Come to the sabbath...now here we come

If you say Heaven, I say a castle of lies 
You say forgive him, I say revenge 
My sweet Satan, you are the oneFrom distant cold cruel moon
Roaring deathwinds desolate
Ripping flesh, crushing bone
Killing off the human race
In the night, cold and cruel
My life was taken by the winds

Crushing winds from the cold moon (x5)

From distant cold cruel moon
Holocaust winds roar endless
Crushing your helpless body
Cruel distant moon i worship you...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The full moon rises above our cryptic land
A night as still as death
We set sail towards foreign lands
To honour a tyrant

We fight for what is theirs
Bloodstained steel held by
A horde who show no fear

As we reach the shores
I hear her shrieks, her cries, her moans
At the cryptic waterfalls
This is the eve of battle

We fight for what is theirs
Bloodstained steel held by
A horde who show no fearThis song is about some kind of a myth from
the Inka''s. It tells the installation of
Pariacaca and things around.This is the only lyrics for this song that has been made public for this song


Scum is extinct 
The reds are gone
Our work here 
Can be considered done(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)On frozen lands I seek my home
My end I feel is near
My fate was told so crystal clear
I'll meet no one to fear 
Through all these fights I only felt
My mystic powers unfold
I here now stand so brave and strong
But faithless in my soul

So now the gods will claim my sword
My armour and my shield
For all these years I only longed
My bloodlust to reveal

When the night will flow
Like a stream of blackness, I'll be there
By the northern shores
White ships of Avalon set sail again

Where is my faith, beneath that shadow
that lies floating on the floor
Trying with all my mental powers
Shall be lifted nevermore

Beyond the earthly planes of pleasure and decay
Beneath the abysses where idols rest untamed
My mind's eye gazed in fearful times
the Echoes of a faith once mine

Down secret corridors where sacred bells resound
Pale visions of my olden glory I had found
Behind the doors of death and life
Where no one dares, there I'll ride

When the night will flow
Like a stream of blackness, I'll be there
By the northern shores
White ships of Avalon set sail again

My mind is stormed by thoughts of thunder
My sword tight within my hand
My soul grows stronger starts to uncover
To resurrect my faith
There is my faith, beneath that shadow
Coming down with the rush of storm
Trying with all my mental powers
Faith arose for evermoreI see again.
days of Thunder, my last days of Earth.
eyes of blood, visions of madness, lust and sadness.

Another chance is given, but another lie
is told about the Earth.
I gave my life, I sold my soul.

There's no chance to change your life,
can't you see your god?
Can't you hear him?

You trust him and he failed,
you believed, betrayed.

Bastard sons of lambs
beg for your mercy,
truth was hidden from your heart
ambitious thoughts inside your mind.

One day, one man, a great man
came from the deepest dreams of pain.
We choose to follow, 
we feel the blade cutting our flesh.

I want denied before ou die,
I will defy, don't need to cry.
But why?

They want to drink your blood.
They want to impale your soul.

Another BlackSun, there is a sign
Clods, dark clouds cover the sky
like a veil of death.

Christian Reign begins to fall,
cold winds from the last storm
freese the holy cross.

Ancient dreams wll rise again.
Hate and bleed fall on knees,
Scream and revenge until the end.

No hope for the future,
no one will survive!

Pagans unite to the end of all.
Embrace the fate is for us all.
Blessed be the storm.

Shadows of fear cover my heart
and save my soul.
Be my guide when the sun blind my eyes,
ariver of vlood now flows
through thy face,
bleed for thy kingdom, bleed for me.

Where is reality?
Final destination, the legend of a god
who never exist.

From the ashes of mankind, 
embraced by the hands of doom
Someday will rise again!Can't sense the end is calling near,
Awakened fate, the gates appear,
Now summoned of the calling,
The claws of time stop crawling,
With brittle cheer, a silent fear.

The light - 
The mystery has come to be!
A chosen face for destiny!
Moving forward on to be,
Dreams not dreamt, this is for real!

Swept into the calling breeze,
Fate stricken sight revealing ease!

Fate strikes adjourning this appeal,
Final flight chosen course conceal,
Oppressing fortune to be free,
On due escape farewell to thee,
We're on to be...

Fate's brought us here tonight,
And now I see the light,
In through the gates we go,
On to the end where we don't know,
Our destiny finally told!

The fog now clears from lands once feared,
Forsaken fate, gates re-appear,
Last rites are brought before me,
Fate strikes, no final warning,
Forever never endlessly.(Instrumental)My soul decays with the rotting body.
The life raped by tears and death.
A sword crossing your eyes.
My life and my universe feel the blood.

I feel (that) the hand that feeds me,
Nourishes obscurity.
I feel (that) the hand that feeds me,
Nourishes obscurity.

The darkness envoy will burn you.
Will feed off your skin,
tearing it apart
with its sharp wolfen fangs.

(chorus)

Asphyxiation corrupts the silence,
the ambient is taken by dark tones.

(A violet reflex rebounds to the center)

The winds take away
the stench of blood,
rottenness, but they
return...(Instrumental)Look beyond the twisted belief
You will see the sister of man
Shrouded in the darkness of devotion
She will do all that she can to
Set the world on fire
Hidden behind her might
She bears destruction  of all mankind
She feels her cause is right

Tearing away at the fabric
Of the just and the free
Distorted by a hatred
She delivers vengeance unto thee
Buried underneath the nightmare
Is an innocence lost
Where once a child walked this Earth
Her soul now pays the cost

Set the world on fire
Hidden behind her eyes
Is the pain of her forefathers
Forced to fight their fight

Tearing away at the fabric
Of the just and the free
Distorted by a hatred
She delivers vengeance unto thee
Buried underneath the nightmare
Is an innocence lost
Where once a child walked this Earth
Her soul now pays the cost

Buried underneath the nightmare
Is an innocence lost
Where once a child walked this Earth
Her soul now pays the cost

Look beyond the twisted belief
You will see the sister of man
Shrouded in the darkness of devotion
She will do all that she can to set the world on fireUnproven ground
Yet old is the woe between us
Cast in bone
Is this the sum of hatred crossed?

Thus
You pile them high, your sired sins
And they rank a legion
Wretched whores you shrove
To the very heavens
Arched red rimmed above

Ramparts raised
As mask held before the fate
Argeirt draped
Yet hounds they bay forsaken gate

Thus
Braced walls of lie, your vesper skins
Fear holds swords leaden
Come the dark, horizons low
From the very heavens
Ash to fall like snow

None stands with you
None falls with you
None...

Alone you will stand
Alone you will fall
Alone...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)An eternal darkness has come to us
All light on earth has ended
The new age has come... this is our diabolical age

An invocation to Antichrist, we hail!
Thou let us fall upon thee
And thou made us be as one
Times of hate, war and pain is now here
We have built something strong together...
Our diabolical age has come to be!

In a castle so deep we stand so proud and strong
We raise our blackhearted souls and greet
This everlasting and eternal age of darkness
This is our diabolical age

Face us, come into our souls
Feel the blackhearted darkness
Feel the hate, feel the masters of the diabolical age
Worship us, worship our new age

See the hate, see the pain
See our mighty and dark rivers
Where sacrificing blood flows in streams
We sacrifice for our new age
We sacrifice all we want and all we need
Do what thou wilt now

Oh, so darkly and proud
Oh, so black and hateful
Oh, so mighty and strong
Oh, how we hail thee
Hail the diabolical age.. Hail!Dyvim Tvar - Keeper of the Dragon Horde - Lord of Fire

At your command, destruction unfolds
For the glory of Chaos, the Fate's horn calls

By the sacred caves outside Imrryr
In a place where no mortal should dare
Lives a race as old as time itself
Ancient allies to the powers of chaos

Bringers of fire and venomous death
Eyes cold as a frozen desert

Almighty leader of dragons of Melnibone
At your command, destruction unfolds
For the glory of Chaos, the Fate's horn calls
In the Wake of the legions of Dyvim Tvar

Remnants of a perpetual war
In a vortex of cinders they soar
Beastly heirs of lost kingdoms, behold
Where they came from, no one can recall

Great wings are beating with thunderous force
Stendors of knighthood unfurl
Riders with shields and spears mounting the horde
Champions of eternal war

Ancient kings of the sea
Heed the call of Dyvim
You who conquered this world
in olden days
Only few of your elder race remain
Sacred kings, hear my voice
Spread your wings on the waves
To defend with your fire
The gates of Melnibone
When the omens are drawn
And the dice is cast for warLyric by Igniis Inferniis

I follow uncertain ways
In the winter shadows
Through the dense forest of past
Conquest...

A thin layer of fog
Hides the verdant fields
Visions and thoughts appear on it
Evoking remember memories

In this cold night of eternal feelings
Angry souls celebrating the flesh
Pain and suffering lost in time
In thousands of decomposed bodies pits

In my mind, any doubt
Men women and children
Rot in this ground of forgotten glories

Noble people who fought for their ideals

I see in their eyes the pride lived at that time
And I feel that I am part of this clan
Because everyday I live this glorious past

In this unique and magic night
I hear the howl of our brethrem wolves
Announcing the return of the dark winter
Nocturnal beasts invoked by the spirits of the south

Which fight like our ancestrals
The eternal feeling of winter shadow will never endSick senses and the arms straight out in the dark
His silence, screaming without a sound
Bowing his head setting the crown on the right, slowly turning
The eyes of glory, the old one you never knew, the eyes you never knew

Gazing from the shadow, crippled hands towards your skin
Moving in for the slashing, rushing through the light
The man is silent, yet the chaos overwhelming, serving the greater
The man you knew so well

Forcing your eyes to open, where lies remains of the harvesting of the damned
Madman serving hellish winds, the old man drooling, on his once own blood

The eyes you never knew

Ripping your wounds, who is the tailor of these, macabre, senses of death
Rattling your bones, from what raises the spells setting fire to the flesh

The eyes you never knew

Forcing your eyes to open, no remains beyond the harvest
Madman serves the hellish winds, old man's ancient crown of glory, glory SathanasOur past goes with the light to the great nowhere 
The radiation of our thoughts and visions 
Ride the fourth dimension to get the center of Sansara 
To enter the house of forgotten times. 

I wander blind in sands of time 
And grope illusions to adore 
Amid the wail I yen to hear 
Yet challenging... 
The call of Yore 

Past leaves with the light 
Millenniums to radiate 
The wheel of Sansara I ride 
Reviving the dead 

Begotten by the Age of fall 
I choose to drink the cup of scorn 
In void of present I recall 
Yet challenging... 
Descant of YoreBuilt upon many frozen mountains of blood,
Immortal gods of that mount rules this frost,
In the blackstorm crypts of eternal grim horizons
forged candle nightworlds under ice mysticism, 

Dancing through such hostile frozen skies
across the vermilion lakes that cradle their iron cage,
Demonized divisions to the unholy warlords in winter ice
that has sailed this dead oceans of blood, 

Everything here seems so bleak with no remorse
but yet I still sense a solemn embrace
by the return of winter skies,

This eternal and Nocturnal winter odyssey
freely shifts through the sorrow of darkness,
Full-filled by the midnight phases.

Passing of the highest order
that surrenders to the will of Immortal Gods of Frost....
The heavens ensparked sorcery of winter
wizards that contemplate the stages
that I cripple on the 'forlorn' path,

Wandering frostbitten through the artic desert
clouds the manipulation of deep lacerations
that cyclones of the frozen fester,

Nearly dead my breath-by aged lungs
in another place where funeral mist beacons 
the previous circle of dawn,

Passing of the highest order
that surrenders to the will of Immortal Gods of Frost



(All lyrics are property of Ravenelm/Munnin)Born in a time of violence
Raised with sword and fire
Told to fiercly stand bold
Against all the odds
To witness the coward murder
Parents as a young boy
Breeding hatred and vengeance
For the christian believers

Feeding the sense of justice
Deep inside his heart
On the forest graves
He promised to the gods
To grow to be a warrior
Mighty and strong
To fight for freedom
And get his own revenge

Gods watched over him
For the next nine years
Then in the autumn twilight
He rides with a torch
To burn the holy temple
And slaughter the stupid priest
Gods are satisified again
And legends will be toldSlzami zmacana zem otcov
spocinula v naruci hlbokej tmy

vztycene k nebu ako hroty kopii
v nemej ucte k zemi sa zohli

by the mines at the earth's core
A blade of fire was forged
That shone with the light of Sun and Moon
Banishing darkness and fear 
By the Second Age's war
in the year 3441
a Last Alliance was formed
That night, on the plain, were elves and men
and Narsil, the sword of the King

All leaders fell, but Sauron's spirit fled
The remnants told the tale of the broken sword

The shards, preserved
were kept in Rivendell
awaiting for the heir
Numenorean, Eagle of the Star
Chieftain of the Dunedain

Elrond foretold
The sword wouldn't be reforged
Until the ring was found
and the Shadow returned
Then the blade of Elendil
would return to Minas Tirith

The day has come! We're marching off to war
Up from the ashes, your light shall guide us

Flame of the West, soaring unstained
Unextinguishable sun of wisdom
Reforge the sword, as deadly as of old
Your seven stars shall gleam in battleA trip on psylocibine
Hypercommunication supreme
Another toxic god, another toxic dream.

Symbiotic relation
Between nti si tho and human creation
The epitome of the transgalactic generation.

Invisible and Incorporeal
Seeing but not seen
An excursion to aeons of time and space
In the kingdom of psylocine.

New religions, televisions
Frustrations, depredations, this damned place
Would you give it all up
just for the little of bemushroomed grace?

"What today is resolved into the effects of a mere drug
a tryptamine or lysergic acid derivative, was for them
a prodigious miracle, inspiring in them poetry
philosophy and religion."

Phantasmagorical scenes
Beyond the veil of low-life schemes
A quick fix of madness and eternity juxtaposed.

Hollow creations, legislations
Caught within the social maze
End it up, give it up
Welcome to biosynthetic space.

"In truth, he is the five senses disembodied
all of them keyed to the height
of sensivity and awarness
all of them blending into one another most strangely
until the person, utterly passive
becomes a pure receptor
in delicate, of sensations.

As your body lies there in its sleeping bag
your soul is free
Loses all sense of time,alert as it never was before
Living an eternity of night
seeing infinity in a grain of sand.

What you have seen or heard is cut as with the burin
into your memory
Never to be effaced."

" Then, indeed, as you lie there bemushroomed
listening to the music and seeing visions
you know a soul-shattering experience
recalling as you do the belief of some primitive peoples
that mushrooms, the sacred mushrooms
are divinely engendered by Jupiter Fulminans
the god of the lighting bolt, in the soft mother earth."Ons Noodlot draait het wentelend rad

Carve into the tree, herald
And shout out, he has come
Carve into the stone, her
And shout into the space, he has come

Ancient scriptures
So old
Keys of Lemegethon
Are lost
But so many
Awake with usWolf and Serpent

Cursed remnants, leper seeds of raped soil
Echoes of forgotten wars came throught the ages
Each time when storm clouds are condensed
Over the earth amazed with happy blindness, our time comes

In a dim light of candles shades are dancing on a ceiling
Silent monotonous chanting and flames crackling

The icon of the Pan looks from hardly shined gloom
At the stood figures in robes gathered in a dome-shaped hall

The signs of Wolf and Serpent
Over a floor covered with nails
Ladder steps with the dried up brown stains
Lead to a scaffold with the sacrificial well filled with snakes

The maiden drugged by sweet cures
Unsteady steps rises on ladder steps as if delirious

Falling down orgiastic culmination
Slippery cold creatures coiling on a snow-white skin
Thousand poisonous teeth are greedy stuck into a virgin flesh
Filling her belly with a cold snake semen

Orden of the Wolf and Serpent
When flesh meets steel in a pagan darkness
Sacrificing the innocence
In a hour of a blood-red fullmoon

Sacred signs and symbolds arising from the past
Shades are condensed again at the abandoned dolmens and cromlechs

The darkness of night is disturbed by whitish flashes of torches
And the Orden of the Wolf and Serpent sticks canines into a gentle flesh of the victim againWhere is silence? 
The voices force me down 
When is silence? 
The voices make me drown 

They want to take my soul 
use and abuse it 
They bleed my life 
torture and destroy it 

Touched by temptation I feel the colour of loss 
Touched by temptation I smell the taste of my flesh 

Where is silence? 
The voices force me down 
When is silence? 
The voices make me drown 

They want to take my soul 
use and abuse it 
They bleed my life 
torture and destroy it 

They reach closer to my side 
No way out, no place to hide 
There's no chance to win the fight 
No way out, no place to hide 

Touched by temptation I feel the colour of loss 
Touched by temptation I smell the taste of my fleshFloating in spheres of menacing silence
Suffocation and mental pain are equal
Surrounded by transparent bodies which infiltrates into me

I can't control my movements, my soul is trapped
In this body, wake me up!
The subconscious is shouting at me all the time
"Face this issue or you'll die!"

Shadows of trees are covering my naked skin
The moonlight discloses a carefully guarded secret
Uncovered gashes

So many years had past but still I am struggling
Deep black colours devours my fragility
Skewed faces of people I used to love turn into faces of demons

I can't control my movements, my soul is trapped
In this body, wake me up!
The subconscious is shouting at me all the time
"Face this issue or you'll die!"

I can't control my movements, my soul is trapped
In this body, wake me up!
The subconscious is shouting at me all the time
"Let this end... let me finally die!"Wir rufen Deine Wolfe
und rufen Deinen Speer,
wir rufen alle Zwolfe
vom Himmel zu uns her.

Wir rufen Dich vor allen,
nun kommt die wilde Jagd,
nun lasst das Horn erschallen,
um keinen Toten klagt.

Der Feind ist schon verfallen,
eh dass der Morgen tagt.

Das Wild hat keinen Namen,
der Feind hat kein Gesicht,
das Vas hat keinen Sammen,
gerecht ist das Gericht.

Die Ernte ist vaergangen,
die Spreu ist taglich feil,
die Raben jetzt verlangen
ihr angemessnes Teil

Die Jagd hat angefangen:
nun halt uns Herr, Dein Heil.

(Lyrics written by Friedrich Hielscher)It`s a quiet night, the night before battle
Candles are burning with infinite light
Wizzards and Witches gathered together
Knowledge and Magic lightens the night
The great wizzard casts a spell 
A spell of immortality and eternity
Fire is burning, screams can be heard
We`re calling for Gods
Hear us Mond
Gods of War hear us
Gods of light hear us
Goddess of future hear us
Guide our souls to braveness
Guide our swords to victory
Guide us to freedom
Guide us to war(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Alone I sit, I wonder why
You dream of love and so do I
But in your sleep you cannot see
This pain which is always haunting me
What I need I'll never feel
This world is for me unreal
So I drink to darkness with a candle lit
And through the whole night alone I sit

CHORUS
The sleeping beauty
She stops the bleeding
She stops the bleeding in my soul
She is fresh air in this stinking world

The more I drink, the more I see
That suicide could be the key
To the place called paradise
Where pain not dwells, not hate nor lies
But if I look beyond all this
I reckon something I would surely miss
Because in my dreams I rule my life
And the sleeping beauty is my wife

CHORUS
The sleeping beauty
She stops the bleeding
She stops the bleeding in my soul
She is fresh air in this stinking world(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Bodies fail in speechless tatters
Pools of black, pools of red
A predator among the flocks
A hint of smile, the grinning dead

The cracked and hollow seeping sky
Folded wings, murdered crows
In among the saints and prayers
A hint of smile, the warm blood flows
A hint of smile, the warm blood flows
A hint of smile, the warm blood flows

Ice cold rise
In rotted air
Hate made flesh
Submit and despair

Unclean lie
You cannot see
Your god is alone and
In death prays to me

Sin for sin
Zealot's slave
Unholy ghost
No one shall be saved

 
Butcher all
As I desire
Or wake in hell
To light your own funeral pyre

Martyrs wail
Prophets cry
Elysium waits
Leave no one alive

Hope is lost
Passions played
Innocents burn
For a god that I madeunholy night calling me
the spirits of night air
unholy night calling me
im inhaling the night air

unholy night calling me
im drawn to the night
unholy night calling me
im inhaling the night air

unholy night calling me
i stand before the moon
unholy night calling me
im inhaling the night air

unholy night calling me
the spirits of night air
unholy night calling me
i breath and then i die oh

this is what i owe to you
i breath in the air of nightWhen you die
The past brings shame
And for your life
Nothing is given

A false chance for bliss
Brings us failure
It was out of my reach
And still i thought...

Why do we stay?
What is my purpose?
And still i thought
And still we live
And still i hate life...

And as you die
remember all the times
We are pathetic in every way
There may be feelings of worthlessness...

There may be feelings of worthlessness
That controls your thoughts and mind
You see the feeble forms of yourself...

Rotting... from inside out
You begin judging your every move
Constantly critiquing and unsatisfied 

And you realize you are nothing...

And your end is imminent, within your grasp
That control your thoughts
See the feeble form

...And the end is imminent, within your grasp


Karmageddon- Guitar, Drums, Lyrics and vocals (Second half)
Hrodvitnisson- Drums, Lyrics and Vocals (First half)They are the kings of terror
And pain, the people will whisper
Their name. Spreading by the light of the moon,
Pyrotechnical wizards of doom.

Language of tolerance they dont't understand,
They are killing for our nation,
And dying for our land.
They are on the street,
Like the shadow of the night,
Waiting their enemies to start up a fight.

Revolutopnaries!
Revolutopnaries - is their proud name!
Revolutopnaries!
Revolutopnaries - the boys with the flame!

Enemy's life has been burning inside,
Till he dies, it'll burn in his eyes. Hostile
Shelters shall be vanished in flames,
And molotov cocktail will proud like the rain.

They don't have a problem
With the point of view, theirs hatred
Does not understand the loss.
Beating and kicking? Yes, of course,
They have no mercy,
And no remorse.

Revolutopnaries - is their proud name!
Revolutopnaries - the boys with the flame!Black Hordes

The Dark clouds announce the storm
The rain comes to clean the blood from the battlefield
Warriors go to their conquers
Their pagan spirits walk In the Night

In a mortal pact with the emperor
Going to the infinity...they go to conquer lands
In the horizon the dark sunrise
Cults in adoration to the pagan practice

Black hordes of the night... warriors go to their conquer
Black hordes of empire... the dawn of immortality
Black hordes of death... reverence the night's emperor

Black Hordes...By the silence of night
Black Hordes...Spirits of the forest whisper
Black Hordes...Giving the signal of the evil's lord

Look the death's mountain
Reverence the night's emperor
Dark clouds announce the storm
Giving the signal of the evil's lord

In a mortal pact with the emperor
Going to the infinity... they go to conquer lands
In the horizon the dark sunrise
Cults in adoration to the pagan practice

Black hordes of the night... warriors go to their conquer
Black hordes of empire... the dawn of immortality
Black hordes of death... reverence the night's emperor(Instrumental)threads of faith unfurl 
here in this dark 

as pale usurpers exhort spite 
the braziers die 

reviled and crownless 
bled to white 
fell what we could not disinter 

feed and fear all things 

below the eye of the wild 
we are suffered 
to crawl in purity 
when soiled wings 
would bear us farther 

unveiled and faceless 
in respite 
fell what we could not disinter 

bear me flesh he grey of raiment 
walketh closer to abyss than man 

defiled and faithless 
raven-eyed 
fell what we would not disinterFrom the brown infested clouds
 Painful death is unleashed
 Toxic rain upon your skin
 Now you are diseased
 
Pus filled wounds begin to form
 Inflamed bloated mess
 Internal organs sizzle and corrode
 Contaminated blood flows with death
 The features are slowly rotting
 Off your deformed face
 Now you are just
 A twisted mass of burnt decay
 
Retching violently
 Heaving chunks of burnt toxic decay
 Hair falls out
 Bowels expel their rotten stinking waste
 
Body and mind are dubbed a fate
 So horrendous and sick
 The safety of the womb is gone
 Bloody pus oozes from your dick
 
Unformed offspring
 Meet the poisoned air
 Ejected fetuses litter the street
 Men and women cry
 For themselves and their young
 A twisted monument
 Of mans defeatJourney back from the Past
Arrive to an unknown land of shadows
Forgotten sound of the ancient faith
The sound of the ancient faith

I feel the Power again
The power in my blood
I am shining in this rotten dusk
Which is surrround me

I will wake up and crush this reign
Reign of liars reign of decay
I will wake up from the dream of heaven
The frostbitten past will back again

 Forbidden words thundering
And bring the Night
Bring Havoc for the new faith
And glory for the Past

Icy windsripping me
Blowing out the dismal landscape
I'm just the child of roaring storms
I have my freedom(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Deep in the trees are might crows
They are the spies, the eyes of old age
Watching changes happening in ancient culture
advertising the coming of a new oppressor
In the clearing we heard screams of our brothers
Dying by the greed of who want to be a king
Bloody swords sang in the night
The death of our people by the great lie

Hail! Our horned god, king of all forests
The ancient one against liars
Now is time to burn the church
Raise your sword against the symbol of oppression

Old men prophets begins the work
Sulphur, blood and candles burned up
Invoking ancient spirits deep in the trees
The pentagram open the navel of the goddess
Might horned god I evoke your force
The whispers of ancient trees sang the wrath
Keeping old rituals and primeval cultHere in her arms
on my own
in the shine of delusions
The calling illusion
takes my thoughts
and my feel
On the rise of this coil
of growing depression
this coil is boring
the air is so deep
full of dead hopes
The calling illusion
takes my thoughts
and my feel
I fly this breeze, the night

The night now seems to be eternal
this coil of thoughts
steals my breath
as the illusion seems to be real

Follow me
on this coil
of growing depression
follow me
over this wind
the gate of suicide
the breeze of all lies

Over the clouds
higher than wind
illusion brings me
on the higher side
I'm so high embraced in her wings
I feel like who might
dare to leave

The night now seems to be eternal
this coil of thoughts
steals my breath
as the illusion seems to be realOnce I believed
that you were light
But now the darkness
is your guide
You killed my soul
without a fight
You drove me
to the other side
Living just for
a judgement day
And waiting for my row
Who's really come back
from the other side
I would like to know
Chorus:
Living by a miracle
Death is the meaning of life
Short time for a little stroll
Love is the edge of a knife
My body is laying
my spirit it's up
Am I dead or I'm just dreaming
You've done so well as always do
Making my heart stop feeling(Instrumental)[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: Niklas Samuelsson]

Can you see, when it is needed
When higher powers fall
You can stop the agony and the despair
Fight the life of those without hope

Euthanasia, Last Resort
The Final Word Is Yours
Life or Death, Which Shall It Be

Moral standards and Christian beliefs
Prohibits this relief, this blessing
When no medication will help
Then you have to make a stand
Life or death, which shall it beThe beast prepares its attack
Bringing darkness to the seas
Warriors cast their weapons
The ocean falls in flames

Warriors fight for the king
Defend pagan alliance
Using the power of the sword
Destroy the demon of the seas

The black sun on the horizon
Bestial creatures appear in the darkness of the coast
Bring plague and death to the seas
Leaving a trail of carnage everywhere

The cold wind freezes our veins
The certainty of victory warms our souls
Arrows cross the sky, blessed bows
Ripping and slicing the flesh of the enemies

Warriors fight for the king
Defend pagan alliance
Using the power of the sword
Destroy the demon of the seas

The black sun on the horizon
Bestial creatures appear in the darkness of the coast
Bring plague and death to the seas
Leaving a trail of carnage everywhere(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Gears spin, engines roar, prepare for total war. drum march sets the stage, into battle rage. Boiling point, we arise, without compromise, aggressors wrath, now unleashed, victory we seek. 
Lights out, set the spark, fires burn in the dark, scorched earth, consuming fires, on big funeral pyre. Explosives set, hit the switch, blow this place to shit, tempers explode, sanity's lost, prepare for holocaust. 

We've reached the point of no return, come watch with me as Minneapolis burns. The gods of war have taken their turn, they laugh with me as Minneapolis burns. 

Lost souls, mass deceased, rats enjoy the feast, burnt flesh, broken bones, amidst the fallen stone. No prisoners, no white flags, burn it like a rag, in gutted ruins, the fires stoke, all is up in smoke. 

By dawn my legions attack, with relentless aggression till the city is sacked. Firestorm, dragons breath, explotions bring the city to it's fiery death. From light-posts corpses swing, treasonous fools never knew a thing. Tiger tanks fully pound, leveling crack-row to the ground. 

DESTROY... MAIM... BURN!!! 

Homo-bars packed with gays, scream with anguish as they go up in flames. Rage and chaos sweep the town, First Ave. burns to the ground. Gutter punks, leftist trash, floating in the Missisippi for their final bath. West bank anarchists, burn together in a crisp. 

DESTROY... MAIM... BURN!!!Thirst for Revenge: Chapter V of Chikatilo

[written by Marc - May 2001]

Part I: Back from imprisonment

Time in jail was a cleansing time.

Now free to pursue what he desires.

Restless struggle against criminal impetus.

Compulsive seek for innocent victims

New job in a locomotive factory.

Near future looking encouraging.

One year after his last murder.

An eighteen-year-old mentally retarded.

Shortly after, she lay dead, mutilated.

Thirty-eight stab wounds in the body.

Refrain

Nipples, genitals, tongues,

Sweet young flesh bitten off.

Lure, stab, disfigure, violate.

Insatiable thirst for revenge.

Part II: Around the country

On business trips around the country.

October 16, his fiftieth Birthday.

Following another boy in the woods.

Brutal attack, knife blade broken off.

While travelling and killing.

Police investigations gaining momentum.

Anyone convicted of sexual crimes.

Was checked in great detail.

Refrain

Part III: The End

Decapitate, saw off her legs,

Cut out her juvenile uterus,

Slice off part of the face,

Extreme cannibalistic ferocity.

One more victim beaten and stabbed.

The net incessantly closing in.

Naked body covered with leaves.

Finally, handcuffed, under arrest.Visions, that I never have seen before
Illusions, that I never have illustrated before.
Anger, that I never have felt before.
A night; that I never have touched before!
Something strong is growing deep inside of me
So dark and mighty, that it takes my breath away,
But still you're my ecstasy.

MY SOUL IS DEAD!

The demon within me...
The nocturnal beast...
The slayer of a thousand souls, 
Born in me.

Language, I have never spoken before
Through my eyes, a world that I never have seen before
The demon within me...
The nocturnal beast...
The slayer of a thousand souls, born in me
Hellfire succumbs me.

IN HELL I BURN!

Hellfire succumbs me. In hell I burn
Morbid demented. Ultimate mutilation
Incarnate... Arnageddon!

MY SOUL IS DEAD!Like snowstorms veiled the mountainside time has buried my soul
Darkness all around my heart yawns from eyes like empty holes
No candle lights up this lonely way through the seas of frozen tears
Forgotten gods I call to you from the dawn of my years

Of glorious times long gone whispered the chilly northern breeze
I felt the surge inside my veins as I walked between these trees
Cryptic symbols cut by ancient ones hidden in their shadow's night
Led me back to where my soul once lived, I understood their might

Sleeping priest deep in the tomb, thy wisdom I seek
By thunders voice now raise and seal our eternal league
Reconsecrate that sacrificial stone, traitors shall atone
Their blood may be my gift up to the gods, the sun will bleach their bones

Lend me, Thonar, the might I need by the amulet I wear
Hold your strong hand above my tribe and those ones who me dear
The winds take to the sky my calls of the prayers which I spoke
Flying up to my king's bright hall with the sacrificial smoke

Where our sanctuaries stood one day, more than thousand years ago
I almost hear the silent words from the gravemounds below
When time has drunk all thy brothers blood and fimbulwinter eats our land
One blazing will be seen on high, the ancestors' descent

Ghostlike horsemen, stormy winds and clatter of steel
Holy secrets kept by them for you will reveal
The day will come we will join as one in his kingdom across the sea
When I leave my carnal gaol and this world of blasphemy

Black clouds grow from my sacrifice that I have burned in hallowed place
Fly, smoke, where the eagles reign by the sun's last golden rays
Fly, smoke, where the eagles reign by the sun's last golden raysEguna hil da iadanik

WOOD OF SCREAMS (HARLEQUIN)
The day is dead already.
The moon appears
With the sadness of before going to bed.

The beauty of the night
Caresses the bushes until the river
With its tender cloak.
The wind shakes
The apple trees.

It forms
Spooky shadows,
Where the treasure
of happiness
Is achieved by the harlequin
through his sadness.
He sits down near it
With an apple in his hand.

He can hear
A sweat cry
Coming from the wood of screams.

But the tired harlequin
Prefers to drown in the wind
And be waiting for a victim
From the material world
In order to occupy his place.

A beautiful woman
Is approaching
From the wood of screams
Through the steep slope,
Assisted by the river of glasses,
Because it gives
The necessary wisdom
For the condemned
To believe.Who am I?
Am I sly?
Trying to cheat
Cheat with lie
Who am I?
Am I thy?
Has this spirit
Burnt inside?
The truth is...
I tried
Who are You?
Are You true
Feeling fear
In the moonlight?
Who are You?
Are You true?
If You are
When moon looms
Just come into
My arms...

It there is any chance
If it isn't too late
Just call my name
If the wind still remains
If it carries Your name
Don't say our time is up
Who are We?
What You see?
What You feel?
Is it real?
Who are We?
Are We sin?
If We are
Let it be
Who are We?
Are We sin?
If it's a sin
Worth a sin
Let it be
But just try...

Who is He?
Is He real?
He is not
Not for me
Who is He?
Is He real?
Yes He is
But won't be
If You just
Come back to me...

World's gone crazy
So have I

Who am I?
Morning sky
Waiting for the
Sunset's bloody cry
Who am I?
Am I eyes
Of the fate
Ruling over life?
Who are You?
Are You poor
When Your life
Is just for You?
Who are You?
Your heart's hue
Seems to change
Into the cold blue
By Wawok(Instrumental)Svoebt i blodig nyslagtet hud
Som barn jeg i skov blev lagt
For at synke til mosens bund
Til aarusinders undren

Blot maaneskin ikke havde
Kaertegnet min krop den nat
Blot rod fra trae
Ikke bar mig op
Blot deres blot, blot deres blod
Havde stillet nattens sult
Blot jeg var doed...

Skygger fra traeer
Former levende vaesner
Skabt i skumringens foedsel

Hvilesoegende sjaele

Halvt opslugt af grumset vand
Vejen til den visse boed
De fandt mig
De udsultede haender
Red mig vaek fra skaebnen

Blot maaneskin ikke havde
Vaekket nattens yngel
Blot jeg var nedpaelet i sump
Blot deres blot, blot deres blod
Blot jeg var doedStrength dwells in resting earth
sparkles when stroked
death flies through it
but a man cannot die
because of another one.
Heavy hall of roamers
memories of iron armour
strengthen you for a thousand years
if the soul is strong
as the sound of wars
stinky smell
corpserver.
The memory of passed ages
comes alive in seals
it can make you firm
but you have to deserve it.
The light of iron armour
mirror to the fire
The metal of iron armour
cut for our body
by the earth.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)They'll fall! 

Listen up, woeful christians
Your enemies shall speak!

Your belief's an ancient relic
From a long forgotten past
Born of fear and superstition
Only sustained by inqusition

"Take my blood and my flesh -
For you I'll be slain"

What's this for a weird belief
Obsessed by a cross of cruelty
If Christ had been hanged by the throat
Then a Gallow your symbol would be

Suffering and pain is most regarded
Masochism is heavenly rewarded

"Give your life in joy
Embrace eternal glory!
The worse your fate,
Vaster your pain,
Longer you die,
The holier you'll be!"

It's just perverse lie
Just a weird lie
Of a psychotic mind

Pope, you believe you're second just to Christ
Who absent-minded for his 'God' and mankind died
So just let deeds follow up your lies
And like your weakly idol, let yourself be crucified!

Your pride and your lies
A thorn in our eyes

Destiny awaits - we'll not take it any longer
Destiny awaits - opposition's growing stronger
For war - our hearts burning
For war - our hearts blazing

'So let the children come to me!'
We'll restore our kingdom of which we've been betrayed
The Nazarene traitor will meet his final fate
And we're garbed in black - Abysmal hordes

You shall witness utter darkness - our earth has to be
A black orb adorned in sin - in heresy!(Instrumental)Awaken the spirit within, the power
Of ancestor's blood
Awaken your heritage
Which burns in your veins

Bloodlines passed down
Which carry universes
Within and beyond this world

Burning hatred and strength
To conquer pride
Courage, the only way
To a greater existence
Devoid of weakness or fear

Wield the swords
The weapon of pure heathens
This is the path taken
By those who choose to resist...

...Resist the death of the spiritThey had come across the sea
And they rode through woods and mountains
They arrived on the pagan lands
And then baptised with blood and iron
If their god was a god of peace
Why they need shiny swords and armours
And why the temples were defaced
And erased the gods of our fathers

But in east there are still the pagan lands
And the gods of our fathers in their hearts
They refuse to change their faith by the force
Yet ships were sailed to pirate sails

They could not erase our blood
And we still know that we were pagans
Man to man stories are still told
A rumors of the ancient ones
Finally after hundreds of years
Church starts to lose most of its power
Beause our gods almost faded 
But they are rising again(Instrumental)I feel the shame of him dying in his bed
For the glory of Christ refraining from bloodshed
Pain did you avoid, but how will you escape death?
Redundant human life, praying for the end

Can't you feel the anger in your blood?
Can't you feel the deceit of God?
Can't you see the despair of your foes
As their worthless blood flows?

I eternally blaspheme the Holy Ghost
I spit in the face of your pathetic God
I walk the path of the warrior and hallow myself to Wuotan

Lo, there do I see my father
Lo, there do I see my mother
Lo, there do I see my sisters and my brothers
I see the line of my people, back to the beginning
They do call me to take my place
In the halls of Valhalla, where the brave may live forever

I hail the downfall of this sickening world
Where the meek prey upon the strong
The shadow of the cross blinds all light
Eternal darkness is what your God brings

Can't you distinguish truth from lies?
Can't you hear their painful cries?
Can't you hear the hatred in their words
as the legacy of your people burns?The sisters of fate have woven
The destiny of gods and men.
But now thier web is broken
Odin prepares for the end.
Each one will be slain
By wolf by fire by blade.
Together they march to the plain
The world will be unmade.

Seas will boil and rise
The serpent of midgard awakes.
Surtur comes from the sky
The ground trembles and quakes.
Unchain the wolf fenrir
Its eyes glow red.
Loki rides to war
Leading legions of the dead.

Ravenous and horrible the army of the damned,
Clashes with asgardians and desecrates the land.
Earth it shakes see the the serpent arise,
By thors hammer it will meet its demise.
The fenris wolf charges the aesir,
Odin stand and meets his doom showing no fear.
Frey wrestles with the fire demon surt,
But still his flames are consuming the earth.
Consuming the earth,
The world will burn.

{chorus}
No sign of man, nor of land,
the earth is a boiling sea.
This war, of all beings, consumes, all realms of the
Tree it shakes, and it cracks,
but it will never break.
The norns, will soon weave, a new, web of fate.

And soon we'll all die.

The fruit of Idun, has kept the gods young,
and free from mortality.
The Allfather sits, on the highest of thrones,
everything his one eye sees.
Thus he knows an end will come, final and profound.
The doom of all men and gods, comes when the gjallarhorn sounds.

The wolf swallows the sun,
Yet still the world glows.
For surtue the battle is won,
Yggdrassil shudders and bows.
Water engulfs the land,
No where left to run.
No trees mountains or sand,
The age of men is done.

Hear the howl of the wolfs revenge,
Consuming the all-father he will never rise again.
Heimdall contests with loki alone,
Sacrificing himself so the seed will be unsown.
The horn of frey pierces its skull,
Yet surtur is unstoppable he will never fall.
The thunderer lays waste to the serpent in time,
9 steps is all he takes as venom claims his life.
The thunderer dies,
The final demise.(Instrumental)Born of a Raven heart,
I soar into the majestic black.
Alone and soul raped cold,
Cast a spell of death on my horrizons.

Nokturnal blessed wickedness,
I hear the winds speak to me.
A speech from the mountains entombed,
drag me over that line of Oblivion.

Below my ravenous inferno wings,
My tarnished eyes sees the ignorance of human lie
Sky darkens and wilts their flowers,
Absorbs the arcane mana from the trees.

Unearthly deminsional vortex,
sifts the sands of mortal flesh.
How long can I say,
That this life furthers in the breeze.

Shattered the glass of the mirror,
That bestows a realm in which I gaze,
Darker that any in black in the spectrum,
Worship your end.......



(All lyrics are property of Ravenhelm/Munnin)Walking between the ruins i don't have
The courage to look behind. fear follows me like a shadow
Walk toward west,
By now nobody knows why nobody remember when
It has begun, only children full of hate
Save the morning from the madness
Take it s the hand don't let he takes
Wash the dirty hands from the blood

Please save the morning

Before the sea freezes / before the earth burns
Before the snow covers it all
Before the darkness swallow light
Before the scars mark the soul

Before the fire goes off / before the cries rise to the sky
Before the water stops flowing / before the wind stops blowing
Before the hate erases the reason

I fight with shadows / the past burn within
It will burn eternally / memories covered with blood

Save the morning form the hypocrisy
Of the chains of the revenge
Don't shout in front of deadLong dim years of the past
Our forefathers struggled and sacrificed
To build a great collective heritage
Ideals higher than themselves
But suffocating controlled media
Moulded our racial identity
The widespread selfishness
Pitiful self satisfied societies
corrupt by false ideas
No sense of honour or loyalty
To the nation which has bred them
The nation which granted them uniqueness (above all)
They snatch it all, with no thanks
As if they had a right
They live ashamed and forgetful of yesterday
Timid and afraid of today
With no faith or passion for tomorrow
No acknowledgement, to the early fathers of our race
Who fought and suffered to protect our blood
So that we would be as we are
So I stand to hail our ancestors of yesterday
And fight to preserve our blood for tomorrowAbove the sky stars dance when I gaze
into the bright sculpture of my spirits shadowside
she, the shining lady is a part of me
like I'm an element of the glowing lord;
ruler of the days

In the cosmic deeps I see the shape of a human
see a reflection of my truest inside

I'm united with the wisdom
the only wisdom wich exists...
Forever!
I'm this water, eternal life
I'm this fire, will!

I'm this earth, awareness!
I'm this air, omniscience!
Eather

Time and room as fiction only
purest substance
where there's no beginning and no end
the source of wich I drink,
source of all life and existence...In a dark and mysterius night
I dreamt of myself being resucked through the sink-holes
WIDENING OUT AND WRITHING
Entranced by an implacable ecstasy
I entered the remotest dephts of my obscure soul,
Vanishing through somber passages
that lead to the heart of my labirinth
I PASSED THROUGH VISIONS,
provoked by altered states of conscience
VISIONARY UTOPIA.

Burning in terror, black insanity, burdened with hate
Burning in terror, black insanity, burdened with HATE
Burning in terror, black insanity, burdened with hate
Distorted cosmos

And now, I see the path indistinctly
A bridge suspended on the black abyss of memories
Wandering and travelling in the universe
OBSCURE FEELINGS, PRIMORDIAL SPECTRES, BLACK SPIRAL OF HATE

Uncontrovertible forces take possession of me
Making me vibrate and floating
Thrown to the black at interstellar velocity
A journey through my inner being
Sound, colors and sources
Of pulsating cosmic energy
Till the outer limits of unconscious
As a black hole situated
In the center of the universe
Where matter collapses and withdraws in itself
DEFINITELY RESUKED BY THE VORTEX
EVOLUZIONE ATTRAVERSO ALTERAZIONE. (EVOLUTION THROUGH ALTERATION)By the light of the waning moon three sisters fly with the crow
upon wings born from esoteric spellcraft which few are to know
converging from different directions to weave a fate of woe
as cloud banks obscure all light from the world,
a witch's seed begins to soe

Of names unspeakable and strange
beguiling dreams with fear unknown
a whisper creeping like mist through the heart
of mortal dreams, her name you'll never know

This world of man's unrest, false gods they enthrone
as the forests, moon and earth gasp a vengeful moan

At the summit the cauldron stirred
Effigies of their leaders burned
a dark trinity turned to the sky
cursing all who walk the path of selfish human pride

As the dawn breaks through the clouds, a woman child i born
with a will of fire she walks the earth
a curse for a mortal's scorn

A destiny written of wood and blood

Now a young girl walks in the woods, and speaks to the ravens above
'I shall be the undoing of men'
She screamed aloud, and a clap of thunder unrolled
from that moment on was a destiny written of wood and blood

Her will was to know the land, and from its growth to master the magick
and pass into the nether forever!
mysteries held safe by the trees
as she passed into the nether forever!

Now she haunts the dreams of mortal men
her presence stabbing like a dagger of the blackest arts

Nevermore will the see her again
yet feel her caress as their last dying breath

A destiny written of wood and bloodIt's time to die
Death stands behind the door
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of Hell

Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil

With swords and axes
The fight hard
In a massacre
they feel the hot smart

None can survive
People will destroy
Souls like hell
Where demons make a toyCould be lost forever
what lies buried beneath
the pillars of a modern world?

Could be lost forever
what made us noble
and forced us to greatness?

The way of the world unalterable
our fate, heading towards the deepest abyss?

No tears to be shed for a dying organism
taking its last breath

No tears to be shed for this world
tumbling and fading into oblivion

With joy in our hearts
we celebrate its decay
the fading age of spiritual decline

Like the leaves in spring and the rising summer sun,
from smouldering remains of ashes decay
a new sun will arise,
our sun will arise!(Instrumental)Crossing the skies, riding the clouds 
unstoppable, mighty, with skin pitch black 
when the storm is nigh and the winds calm down 
a glare shows up lighting the dark 

Under the falling rain, 
thirsty for blood, bringing the pain, 
the wyverns are raging, the fire is free, 
build your shelters and make your prays 

"Faster than light, thy faith crumbles down, 
the doom of the beasts thou shalt not avoid, 
no one could ever stop the relentless, 
before the deathbringers thou shalt stand hopeless" 

There was a story once told 
where a warrior faced a wyvern 
fury in its eyes he had seen 
but he had the will of a leader 

The beast was not blind, and saw through his soul 
that he was the last one of a pure-blood descent 
wisely he made the choice not to fight, 
but to join him to follow the path of the strength 

Fly higher and higher, 
let every mortal witness our glory 
rage, thunders and fire 
will be our symbol, the seal of our story 

The wyverns didn't forgive the traitor 
so they put end to his life, 
the warrior yelled, and he swore revenge 
...to the end! 

Raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands 
raging wyverns, your greed you shall regret 
raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands 
raging wyverns, may your rot mean your end 

Raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands 
raging wyverns, your greed you shall regret 
raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands 
raging wyverns, your greed you shall regret(Dedicated to Voltaire and his book "Candide")

ALWAYS:

False, faithless, ungrateful, thieving, weak, perverted, envious, greedy, drunken, miserly bloody slanderous, debauched!

Lies!

Hypocritical, stupid, rotten, cowardly, insignificant, cozening, pestilence!

Free will is a lie
Free will is a lieYou play with soldiers of clay your mind is not sane
You live in a game of war, oh, no!
When will you realize, that today, you're losing ground
You're really getting nowhere, nowhere at all!

Your naked sword against my gun
Now it's too late, your time has come
Gone is the majesty you fantasized
Your Glory's a book made of lies

Why can't you see you're losing now
the magic of the moment! You fool!

We were born in the 70's, we got lightning in our veins
We were born in the 70's, and we'll never fade away
We were born in the 70's, we got future in our brain
We were born in the 70's and we'll never lose the race

We were born in the 70's
Born in the 70's, born in the 70's
We don't need no other way

You really think I'm out of my head, you're wise instead
for all that you have learned at school!
Deny this time to live in the past, you were not made to last
You're getting older, you know!

You think your Eden's close at hand
For those who die with sword in hand
Homer and Caesar, have left you alone
You were mistaken and still you don't know!

And now that you came and you joined our cause
Together we stand and we boldly go, to planets unseen
where no man has gone before

And now that you're leaving the Earth behind
A blinking illusion, for all mankind
It's time to live for today, to learn to be freePlease let us give you a welcome 
you are at the Beerbath Bar 
we drench your throat and fill your belly 
while the lasses get you warm 

Inside the feast is getting heated 
get close and choose your spot 
ales are flowing, meat is roasting 
fellows, this night will be everlasting 

A giant barrel full of beer lies upon our heads 
hours go by and golden jars feed our entrails 
the gates knock down and foes are storming in 
they have signed a contract for our butchery 

Drunkenness is our weapon for this siege 
our brothers have gone berserk 
someone cut the ropes of the barrel in the ceiling 
and all the hall is swimming in beer 

We throw the tables off then grab our swords 
flesh comes apart like sand 
we're witnesses of bloody glory 
and will rejoice on gods' delight 

(CHORUS) 
Now they call it the Beer Bloodbath 
that night was called the Beer Bloodbath 
now they call it the Beer Bloodbath 
that night was called the Beer BloodbathTo reach for the ancient land in the ultimate of north
Where pride and purity led to nobility
Idealism as the highest order
In accordance to natures eternal law of life
All falsehood unable to conquer our minds
Omnipresent was the god within ourselves

Suddenly... materialism became part of our lives
So the unity was disbanded
Soon we forgot about our inner voice
Man's instinct overcome by superiosity

Violation of the immortal soul
By deafening the voice of blood
Mental enslavement of the mind
So the highest principles faded into unconsciousness
What once was pure and noble turned into mediocrity
From the pillars of civilization to spiritual decay

No blazing shine left in the eyes
Seemingly awake, yet already asleep
Will that slumber lead to everlasting death
or is fate going to be changed before?

If the divine spark in our soul
Is to become a rising flame once again
A new aristocracy, not of gold
But of spirit will rise again!

From the ashes of decay
A new union will evolve
The highest principle back in full-force
And idealism will lead us again to nobility...The golden walls of heaven are now black
And soon to fall
Angels in white unwillfully stained
Desecrate them all
Ow! Last attack, your prayers won't come true
Don't turn your back one more then I'm through
The final rape of night no more hell to give
No one left to live, never to be missed
Final rape final rape
The final rape of night
Your tears of jizz don't impress at all
And never will
Your cries for god now long forgot
So just lie there still
No sympathy, remorse or regrets
None to be had
Devastating violating penetration
With more to spreadLife as I know it, wasn;t always this way
Once I found my second soul
On a august day you cam

Dreams that I left behind
Thoughts that I decline
I finally found some peace of mind

You are my second soul / once I found my second soul
You are myself / once I found myselfTrist mann liker fjorder
Liker wind og havet.
Det er ingen in rheten,
A varme den.
Han kommer ofte
Se pa havet.

En Ensom mann drommer
Om a bli havet.
Mellomrom i den for a do.

Vind forteller ham historier
Det var og hva er det ikke.
Tidligere soldat elsker havet
Og han vil det a do.

En dag kom han se pa havet
Og det var siste gang.
Han sa pa bredden av den gamle Fienden
Og Kjempet med ham.

Blood ble gushing under sammenstotet
Av sverd, gamle styret ble beseiret.
Han dode, havet tok Ham med til Henne.
Og fort bort av vannet i Asgard.

Han var en soldat som husket gudene
Han husket runer, og han visste skrivingen.
Men han var gammel nok til a kjempe igjen
Og heve krig.

Han ble et hav av.'Tiw' is a sign, it keeps faith well with athelings,
It is always on its course over the mists of night,
It never fails.
Sworn to die, forseen in Woden's dreams.
With the death, an eruption of light.
Forward in time when Middangeard screams.

With boundless strength and skill at arms,
In the jaws of the wolf, his wrist.
Fighting again yet as before.
A prophesised death, still to resist.

Such hindrance only with an end.
Of days could he be undone. 
Only now as Woden's dreams realised.
The Sky as no use for two suns.

The triumphant death of mighty Tiw.
Our God of war doomed to die.
The Wolf of Hel swallowed him true.
As fire burned across the sky.Received through torted dreams
Manifested now on this plane

On the threshold of dark i perceive your frequency
I thought you had disappeared
The god of war in his double nature
The pillars of the world destined to burn
The cycle shall be renewed by the eleven

On the threshold of dark i perceive your frequency
I thought you had disappearedVirginal death the grave is waiting for you
Live without sin no way you'll get in
To hell we all knew
Your heart is weak but still you survive
Reach for the blade and give it a try
Try suicide
The wings you see will be all shades of white
Hell doesn't want you it never will
Keep running to your light
Your heart is weak but still you live
Hold out your hand a razor I'll give
Try suicide
Die of disease that's no way you should go
Take your own life some pills or a knife
Make it fast never slowThe time has come to do away,
clear the waste, none to betray,
destroy the false, imposters we will slay!

Now off to the cliff,
for we will dismiss,
as we do away,
with what we dismay,
what ever is in our way,
the objects pushed astray,
I will feel never again,
any sense of betray.

To the cliff...
as we persist to clear possession we won't miss!
Cease to exist as every problem is dismissed,
lauch all dilemma into the abyss!

Broken by rock,
over the cliff!Close to nature
Close to the roots
Know the true code of life
To kill or die in fight

Cold vengeance in steaming blood
The red covered snows
And the forest greeted us
Its defenders and sons

Wind blows, it's so cold in here
Standing against the mighty frost
Always proudly onwards
Like against the herd of Jesus

Close to nature
Only freedom is an illusion
A dream to come true
When final battle is wonOver night, over moon
our fate is fight till doom
 
in the battle for the truth
i will show to you the great lie

We are the orde of flame
and don't forget: I'll be your king!
We will crucifixe your god, and
Burn, Kill and pile all Christians!

Your Kingdom is so far away
behind the battlefield

you behold your god
but you will fall in the battleground alone

We are the true Inquisition!
The Rage of Pagan Revenge
We are the Cursed Legion by the truth
that your god don't exist

Chorus:
Far Away behold your kingdom
pray to pray, behold your final daysFeel the breath of the wizards clawing your lungs
Follow the winds of night leading you through the deep forest. Raise your arms to the northern stars, the eternals who never disappear.
Hear the voices of the wizards showing you the old path.

Standing into the circle of stones
Creeping fingers of brambles are griping you
Spirits of the sacred woods are coming to you
Thorns of ice searing your flesh
Offering your blood, spilling on the great menhir
Pay to appease their thirst, gods of frost

Bleeding...offering to the spirits of frost
Bleeding...to cross the gates of doom

Walking on the mountain to reach the sky
Walking in the mist to the alter
Crossing the storms of snow and hailstones
Crossing the deep of emptiness

Hoarfrosted will-of-the-wisp creeping around you
The eyes of the wizards are watching you
Spreading stars of blood on the ice
The iron spikes of your armour reflects the frozen light
Prostate on the alter closer to the northern stars
By your eyes your cold soul pray the gods of frost

Feel the breath of the wizards clawing your lungs
Follow the winds of night leading you through the deep forest. Raise your arms to the northern stars, the eternals who never disappear.
Hear the voices of the wizards showing you the old path.He walked thus for joy 
With his dreams alone 
On a plain and looked at the monotonous waste 
Brown hillside, which drew herself up to the horizon 
It was absolute silence. She wants anything 
Neither weed, nor grub 
Or earth worm in the ground 
All was long ago perfect root out 

The ground was unfruitful as a sterile grand dad 
When climbing himself to the peak of the hill 
Spread herself in front of him a plain 
In the middle of plowed field 
Stood three trees. The road was faced with 
Remains of thawed snow and was full of pools 
Earth suck to him entire pieces on shoes 
When he went under the trees, he stumbled over the corpse 

She was already in advanced decay 
Coming out from her dreadful stink and flowing from her mud 
Taking possession of his feeling of fear and helpless 
Feeling of solitude without border 
Of man on a desolate island, that was himself obviously 
It is true slow but with certainly, about it inferior 
He dives into locality from there is no return 
He considers. Came to one's senses 

She was a corpse of world 
The corpse of Earth - and the heaven was muddy... 
Over the thin forest him in grey 
But seemed like the clear air 
That surface of waters is fallen 
Still water also she flooded already and high mountains 
And she covered them as a tire 
That shaken itself and flowed and 
Remained on their startling constancy 

Still but thought 
On this corpse of world 
And she don't leave him alone 
Peace for him, honorable soul 

Invalids being began curious, how will it 
Turn out; - he but without reconsidering 
With automatic drill movement drank up 
His last Urquel and no doubt fell asleepTransilvanian hunger the mountain so cold
Cold cold soul cold

Your hands are cruel careful ... pale ...
To haunt, to haunt forever at night

Take me can't you feel the call
Embrace me eternally in your daylight slumber

To be draped by the shadow of your morbid palace
Ohh, hate living... The only heat is warm blood

So pure... So cold
Transilvanian hunger

Hail to the true, intense vampires
A story made for divine fulfillment

To be the one's breathing a wind of sorrow
Sorrow and fright the dearest katharsis

Beautiful evil self to be the morbid count
A part of a pact that is delightfully immortal

Feel the call freeze you with the uppermost desire
Transilvanian hunger, my mountain is cold

So pure... Evil, cold
Transilvanian hungerIn times no living soul have seen
The stream of time is unknown
There was the void of everything
No sound, no light ever was

Unknown was the ground and sea
Unknown was the air and sky

In solitude a pyre glew
Collapsing structure of flames
Incinerated by chaos itself
Before all sense was born
A distant glance so unseen

The inverted twin of fire
All of energy shall vanish
Enforcing all to stagnate

Unknown was the will and life
Unknown ... sense and death

With power, consuming the void
(All of a s udden, motion appeared)

...of fire and ice
colliding in pain
...of fire and ice
creation of light
...of fire and ice
nothingness is all
...of fire and ice
union in chaosEvil fills the land After the tyrant rules the throne Sorrows fills your village After the slaying of your king When night falls you plot your revenge to rid of the minion controlling your land Raise your sword up to the sky allow your forefathers to see that you are about to enter battle with pride and glory It's time to take back what is yours It's night time again A moonlit night Snow covers the ground You make your approach without a soundWinter solstice
The deadheart of the woods
Gathered the obscure ones
To welcome the falling dusk

In a ruined stone circle girt by blackened oaks
Cloaken figures stoop by ritual fire
Dreary chants echo in the forest's depths
Forgotten ceremonial rites are spoken

Druidic wisdom passed down knowledges ancient
To wield the mysterious power of words and elements combined

Night thickens.... Sulphur is cast upon the fire
The roar of flames..... Is reflected in the falling blade

As the moon peaks high above
Blood trickles down the altar of worn stone
And the stars in the fathomless heavens
Are heralding the awakening of dark primordial forces

The passing of life opens the gates
Spiritual dimensions are aligned

Fog rises in the deep woods
Mists reborn gather beneath nocturnal peaks
Eclipsing clouds soften the moonlight
Returning the lands to ancient splendour

Mystic souls forgotten wander eternally
Arcane might lurks once more in the night's gloom
Mortal lives are bleak as the long winter
And the fire burns rekindled by our dark forest spells...I do not know if I am in this time 
I do not know if I am in this century 
I have a message that I must 
Deliver to anyone who will hear me: 

When I was away, among you 
I believed always like you 
That time has coherent texture 
That follows day by day, year by year 
Each century follows the last century 
But this is not so at all 

I can tell you now because I know it 
Let them believe me, time flows unceasingly 
And somewhere in waste infinity of space 
He answer the sound of words 
As proclaimed a thousand years ago 

Future, as we know it, is here with us now too 
The past, presence and future 
Herself as the planet well known as the Earth 
Where I am once dwelled, unceasingly meet 
We look on time as on something 
What itself right know 
The past is gone and 
Future still she has not set 
But this is not so at all 

It is necessary, that you know 
That yesterday, today and tomorrow 
Is still with you and stays with you 
Age after an age(Instrumental)Get up, awake, holy Russia,
Rise from the ashes of centuries!
Thunder of rage will roar above you,
And let the weight of enemy's fetter will be down.

Wake up, sacred Russia, and straighten shoulders,
It's enough to suffer greatest oppression!
And cruel punishment waits for those
Who have drunken the blood of your sons for a century.

Mighty people rises for the battle,
Anger burns in it.
The battle is for our soil and blood,
And we're fortuned to win.

Let the dawn shine above the lines of brave men,
Who remember the legacy of fathers,
And millions of hands will rise up to the sky,
Hailing the new dawn.

We bravely march, group after group,
The shield for Motherland is reliable.
Runes of victory burn in our hearts,
The sign of sun flies on banners.
There will be no remorse, the revenge will be cruel,
Hand won't tremble in a fight,
And white power of the warriors of light
Will help to crush the enemy.

Mother Russia calls us for defense,
Rise from the knees, Homeland!
In the fight for the freedom of Native land
We'll go - it'll rise.

Disturbing alarm sounds across the land,
Native land, wake up!
And the voice of brave warriors roars:
"Wake up, our Russia, wake up!"Thrice was I burned
Thrice reborn
Becoming and thirst
Convulsions rebirth

As you were flesh my host entwined
Pain maiden on raven ride
Flame wreath brow, blood ribbon untied

Serve festering bread
And bleeding rancid wine
Am I the last one
To carry your son
Crippled orphan

Nine tied to leash
Those held endeared
Thirst of deceased kin drown into weir
Am I the last one to carry your son

Be the drums
Drums of black death
Be the drums between my heartbeats
Be the drums between my breaths

Air wet with rapture and scent
Masks of rust and sanity bent
Shroud white on shadows bride
Carries your sons

Thrice was I burned
Thrice reborn
Hold the earth above my berth
Nine tied to leash
Those held endeared
Thirst of deceased
Kin drown into weir(Instrumental)Rise my brothers
From the archaic depths
Our weapons will shine
Like the shimmering isles
Of the lands we once possessed
Now shining bright!

As the flames flicker
As the horns sound
Our deaths will sing a song
Sung on every tongue
As Dagnor dies on his throne
The revenge we sought
Is now won!

The battlefield strewn with warriors
A feast for the crows from the sky
Soulless and bleak
A silver horn beckons
My friends in the halls of their fathers

I will rise again, in that new world
With the strength of my gods and
The wild stag at my back!

From Orghlaith I leave
Leave this land behind
To find my kin there
And learn what life has in store...Returning from war, we sail the high seas,
Past the horizon, lie our destinies,
We return to the halls laden with gold,
Of our journey, tales will be told.

"Cattle die, kindred die,
Every man is mortal:
But the good name never dies
Of one who has done well."

The northern star guides us home,
A long way we have come,
Surely one day we will die,
But our glory will live forever.

"Cattle die, kindred die,
Every man is mortal:
But I know one thing that never dies,
The glory of the great dead."

Death is certain, life is not,
The Norns foresee the end,
But when Midgard crumbles in Surt's blaze,
It is the start of Baldr's days.

"Cattle die, kindred die,
Every man is mortal:
But I know one thing that never dies,
The glory of the great dead."Erebus, Erebus.
The never ending chaos.
The source of every life.
Gave birth to darkness and
The black night.
Darkness, darkness rules everywhere.
Lighting flashes tear it apart.
Thunders hit the mountains of mother earth.
Slowly the rage stop and the earth sinks.
In eternal darkness.

Darkness again.
Darkness again.

Darkness rules everywhere.
Lighting flashes tear it apart.
Thunders hit the mountains of mother earth.
Darkness, darkness faithless darkness.
And this eternal night who feeds on truth
In the abysmal chaos.
Darkness which grew in thy womb.

Oh mighty gods.Streets of disease land of decay
Poisoning veins no help to pray
Fall down to your graves
Darklord imperial slaves
Your search for satin will be of little use
Nowhere to go but down
Give me your flesh cut straight from the bone
Soon it'll be my crown
Prowling leather
Demon of dark angel of black
Pure hatred burns start your attackCoulds traveling the winters
Since you've swon a tiny seed
At riverside that day
Then lay upon the dark waves
Stream carried you away...

Slough then released the burgeon
That I never hoped to see
A fortune left to take
A willow grown of your will
Seem' you did not forsake...

Waters, may you travel near
Bring news from far of my dear
Until then I shall sleep in willow's womb
A baby in the tomb

Clouds travling the winters
And I no longer care
You're gone all the same...
Leaves caressing the dark waves
The willow is my nameThe assault of ravaged wind blows
into our faces and long Nordic locks,
Into the gleam of the rising sun from afar
our swords into the breeze glistens of eternal pride,
Under the falsetto of the mid-summer day
our banner blew in the winds of our horns,

Over that hill that we stand before
awaits the chapel for the weak of heart,
The cross looms over the green horizon
that tarnishes the blood of barbaric clergy,

From that mild day of July
we ransacked the golden halls of their false god
and expelling the damned Christian enemy from our soil,

Horns in the midst blowing ever harder
as the chariots of thunder charged by Asgard's call,
We the unbaptized heathens from the Northelands
with a heart of war and glory burns that house
of Christ to the ground,

Our ancestors shall not have died in vein
for the brothers under the sky shall set them free,
As our swords carve through their flesh...of men
woman, and even their children
we eradicate this vile poison from our lands,

Spill every last drop of their blood,
Melt down the crucifix into our foundries,
craft more blessed heathen steel,
to yet again cut down our enemy.

White cross will be denied

Necromania

Call of storms the wind and rage
Rite of dark possessed by chains

Necromania

Mystify cursed Christ delloration
Retriburion of suffocation

Necromania

Barriers of sound and stone vengeance is mine
Armageddon wars force the sign

Necromania

Call of storms wind and rage
Black death possessed in chains

NecromaniaDuring the night the truth is revealed
After a long wait
The prophecy comes true
The gods are playing with our destiny
And The screams of Cassandra resound 
in the air

Ten years ago
We did not believe in our Fate
The flames now say it's too late
Today my house's walls are shining bright

The smell of victory and peace makes us foolish
And now the dawn brings a gift full of hate 
and decay

Nowhere and nowhere you can hide your fear
But the fire of betrayal surrounds all the night
and the deep dark
will lead us to the end

We're rising from a flame 
From ashes as a phoenix 
There's a new beginning 
We're roving over seas 
The tears of my sorrow are not
shed in vain

We rise from here
From the screams of the slain
Betrayed by the gods

Creeping on tonight, we escape from 
the light that
Corrodes our past lives
Faster, much faster we go to the stormy sea
Don't turn your head to look back
Forget your memories they're turned into dust
The age of my people has gone by

Nowhere and nowhere you can hide your fear
But the fire of betrayal surrounds all the night
and the deep dark
will lead us to the end

We're rising from a flame 
From ashes as a phoenix 
There's a new beginning 
We're roving over seas 
The tears of my sorrow are not
shed in vain

We're rising from a flame
Rising to begin
From nowhere beyond the seas
We're rising from a flame
Waiting for a time
When shame is avenged by the glory of Rome(Instrumental)Dreamlike beauty with no human face
Saw you crawling in the moonlight
Like a warm ocean wave
Obscuring my whole sight
As these silklike nightshades
Erase the world around-

Come, come, i call you
And so have i done for a lifetime
You were born in the past i walked
(through
But never could i find
Where you used to hide
From this pale reality...

All of these words...
May they be blown by the winds
And find one day
The path to your imaginary world...
I've walked for years
The paths to in existent lands...
May once my hand
Be taken forever by yours...

I knew the storms, i faced the thunder,
Went through the rains... and the tears
But sometimes your whispers
Shattered despair and fears
Was it your voice
I heard among the trees?

Were they your eyes i saw through the clouds
Sunlight filtered through the grayness?
But when i lay on the ground
Begging for a gaze at your face
I never saw anything but emptiness,
Neither felt your caress...I summon the ancient forgotten
Battle spirit of my nation
Arise from the depth of ages
Return from benighted times!
Seize the souls of my bloodbrothers
Make us valiant and ruthless
Teach us to fight, help us to win!

I summon, I conjure, I call - arise

I summon pristine spirit
Spirit of war, pride and glory
Spirit of thousand battles
Power of ancestor's swords
I pray for the gods of war
Mighty Volh and great Perun
I call might of heathen land
Shadows of the battlefield of my motherland!

Lead us against those aliens
For whom there's no place
In our sacred lands
Help us to burn them down
To trample and to tear them to shreds
Give our race power over the whole world!igher than the bonds of Kin 
The waves of Orghlaith stood still 
Ulin did reside above 
The hand forged again 

From the waves a chalice rose 
covered in the roots of oak 
the promise of a new age 
Where blood and silver flowed as one..Down, down in the dark
Calls from below
Coming to feed
Blood's her need
Corpses galore
Like a human meat store
she's coming to feed
Blood is her need

Gleaming with leech-ridden slime
She watches the shore
Hoping for more
Flesh to eat
Sores
Riddle her face
Sunken dead eyes
Festered with flies

Down, down in the dark
Calls from below
Coming to feed
Blood's her need
Corpses galore
Like a human meat store
she's coming to feed
Blood is her need

Waterlogged bodies float by
Pulling flies from the sky
Locals they cry
Burn the hag
Torches and axes they go
Calling her name
Nellie we came
Came for your head

Down, down in the dark
Calls from below
Coming to feed
Blood's her need
Corpses galore
Like a human meat store
she's coming to feed
Blood is her need(Instrumental)The lies of Christ will lose
the ways of hell I chose
I drink the floating blood
defy the fury of God

I have turned my back on Christ
to hell I have sacrificed
I have made love to the Pagan Queen
the gates of hell I have seen

I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky

I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
and when I die I have a place
reserved in hell

In conspiracy with Satan

I ride the bloodstained goat
I let the brewage float
I have seen the reaper's face
and walked through eternal haze

I have kissed my master's hand
I have seen the children of the damned
I heard the demons call
and seen a thousand virgins fallDark clouds, and ash skyes
The wind brings a wolf cry
The forest calling never stop
I loose my self into the fog

To find the purity of the stone
To find the truth of the leyend untold
Mother nature, you are my only god
Bring your knowledge to your son

The truth is in the forest of winter fog
I loose my self in winter fog
Never leave me alone winter fog
Make a man, winter fog

When i scream in the dark night
Frozen tears falls from my eyes
They are the rage transformed in ice
Winter is in me, and in my mind

The truth is in the forest of winter fog
I loose my self in winter fog
Never leave me alone winter fog
Make a man, winter fog

Hear our cry, we are the sons of winter!
Walking in darkness
through the iced ways of mandness
we are the sons of winter!As Prince of Darkness is rising
Blood bites through the white
The gates of hell are open
When wrath kisses your bride

She belongs to him now
He controls her mind
She is a part of his world
She'll become one of his kind

Speaking of angels one often sees their wings
Blessed from God and surrounded in burning rings
Something is hauling ghosts to the forbidden side
Beware of the sworn enemy with his deadly bite
Naught-repeat-nothing can kill their master at night
Bring him the Black cross to walk on sunlight!

He holds the power of Black cross
He's got the blood of virgin
Stop the flow of evil dross
Before the slaughter will begin!

Creature whose body is dead but it lives on
Is searching for the God's sacred name
In such a manner universe will be gone
World will burn to ashes in his bloody flame!

As moonbeam touches the sunlight
The devil-may-care for your despise
Moon spreads over the sun into the night
She is a victim for his coming sacrifice
Soon you will hail to the rising sun
Don't cry for the moon bow to the Fallen one!When the night comes, I walk toward 
The tall castle ruins 
The snow flakes fall into my eyes 
Like frozen tears

I wonder if winter will be long 
If the grey storm will be strong 
If the call of our ancestors 
Will be loud?

The ruins are so old, they keep so many secrets 
When the call resounds, enter the forteress 
In this forgotten place, men were warriors 
In the memorial ruins, memory still alive

Surrouded by the oaks, the great spirit keepers 
The ground tells a story about the final battle 
The murders of the children, in the XIII century 
The blood that covered the snow, in the frozen land


I follow the call, searching for memories 
When the stars begin to shine, I walk into the fields 
My heart is so full, and my visions disapear 
The past was so cruel, in the forgotten ruins 

Slaugthered and enchained, the spirits try to whisper 
Trying to reach some peace, but they are cursed forever 
The return of the shadows, reflected by the walls 
This light that doesn't shine in the winterAlone in the own country
 There's no escape and no wind from other side
 Among the fallen bowed trees
 No more hope and freedom in the eyes
 The bog between two dry lands
 Everyone has invisible big hump
 Unfabled reign of silence
 Inhabited with the people in the swamp

 Among the fallen bowed trees
 No more hope and no freedom there is at all
 Life seems dead unknown actress
 Who died of grievous silence in the hall
 They swim downstream like a driftwood
 That's the price of a calm and quiet life
 Some shelter and some simple food
 What can you ask for if you live in a lie

 The bog between two dry lands
 Everyone has invisible big hump
 How can you use your talent
 When all the time you have to go over bumps
 Life taught not to trust anyone
 Rich neighbors used to rob you with brazed smile
 The grace is false under the sun
 Meanwhile the swamp slowly devours you alive

 Unfabled reign of silence
 Inhabited with the people in the swamp
 Ignoring any violence
 Don't you become unfeeling as a stump
 I will not longer talk to you
 Chasing welfare you have lost intelligence
 The story ends to tell the truth
 Drowned man alive and there is no second chance(Instrumental)Bleeding wood cleaves the grey
Fill breath of fear the sails of men
Barren horizons away 
Black shores there lay 
Home aeons astray

Release of vows that you flee is vow sworn to the sea
Redress of soul set free is soul sworn to the sea 

Howls of tempest winds hasten
Dragged from wells of deepest descent
Where weeping sky ends
Light heaven sent
Forges waves as gods revenge

Release of vows that you flee is vow sworn to the sea
Redress of soul set free is soul sworn to the sea 

Rise, cold valkyrie white,
with frothing wings voracious tide
Drown beneath waves I''m sworn
In salty grave I shall be reborn(Instrumental)When the breath of North
Would descent upon the
boundless distances
Woods would live again
and the ground would speak
The flakes of snow, so pure and
white would burn my heart.

When the trees would
dress in the silvery gowns
In the falling tears of eternity, the
great cleansing would come
Great mystery of the first blizzard
And everything would start again
from the very beginning.

I would give one thousand
lives to see it again
To feel again the Great
power of my Fatherland
When the higher
mystery would be perform
And everything would start again
up from the very beginning.

If you're unable to see it,
Better not to see anything at all.Why should the Fruit be held Inferior to the Flower?

Why should the Son be taught to Hate?

Why should the Lord be Unquestioned?(Instrumental)I put myself down with a feather on my heart
There were the evergreen trees
Sleep their enchanted dreams
Lay myself down in comfortable silence
Nearby the storm that reaps my mind.

Never to be defeated again,
But dead eyes always stare
Counting the hours, searching the night
I try to find some peace of mind
I am weakened by grief
I am a ruler in time
I am a prisoner in reality
I am turning the decay

I hold my breath in search for something...
I have seen it now: we were blinded by lies
Where all fail to hold on
That's where I keep up my faith

Never to be defeaten again,
But dead eyes always stare
Counting the hours,searching the night
I try to find some peace of mind
I am weakened by grief
I am a ruler in time
I am a prisoner in reality
I am turning the decay

The light that I have seen
Forever im my dreams
Something has awoken inside me
Amazing could this be?
It's feeling so unreal
The part that has awoken inside me

Getting lost within myself
I dream of unreachable thoughts
New you carved up inside
(Maybe) Because you're reaching too far

Getting lost within myself
I find myself screaming at night
New you carved up inside
(Maybe) Because you're reaching too far

A timeless flame
Deep within my heart
The hope is burning
...Deep inside!Daer cwaemen aenghevlooden door het Meetjeslandtsche sandt,

Getrieben durch die Kraft meines Geistes.
Getrieben durch den Hass gegen sie.
Den Feind gerichtet durch meine Hand.
Den Feind zerschmettert durch meine Wut.

Ich bin die Klinge, die den Koerper schlitzt.
Ich bin die Kraft, die euch nieder zwingt.
Getrieben durch den Verstand, den ihr mir raubt.
Getrieben durch jene, die sich selbst nicht erkennen.

Den Blick gerichtet auf den Wald.
Den Blick verwoehnt durch die Schoenheit kirchlicher Tuerme.

Ich bin die Fackel, die den Turm erhellt.
Ich bin das Feuer, welches ihn niederbrennt.

Und mit meinem Stolz werd ich euch vernichten.(Instrumental)Every day when the burning sun goes down
I feel that something comes to me
Reflection in the mirror of life, we'll suffer in agony
Under the wings of a dragon we follow hate
We care about nothing after death
Heirs of fortunes believe only in lies
We cannot see the depth of signs

Surrounded by the fear, faces wet from tears 
Oh no...
Can you tell me what you see?
In the name of greater good you're taking lives 
...hands stained with blood

Thousands dying dreams, thousands crying souls
Forever lost in pain, never live again
Oh...

Now, sun is down
And I am here
Your judge, your chosen
In your life with your lies
With fire in your eyes

Justice replaced by vengeance, devil's smile
Bloody moon eclipsed the burning sun
No more second chances, no escape
It's time to pay off debts
Deadly shadows penetrate into us
Everlasting curse, our hope is lost
In the ruins of nations there is a clue
Our elegy of doom

Surrounded by the fear, faces wet from tears
Oh no...
Can you tell me what you see?
In the name of greater good you're taking lives
...hands stained with blood

Thousands dying dreams, thousands crying souls
Forever lost in pain, never live again
Oh...(Instrumental)Woods and green was the heart of his home
Cold and dark was the core of this soul
He didn't know about the peace of mind
Something raging from inside of his chest

Pushed to run into the deep
Blood and anger into his eyes

Claimed by the reign of the lonely wolf
Marked by the sign of the Red Moon
Raging at the night howling to darkness
Bare feet on the fresh cradle of leaves

His desire of run
Into the deep of the trees

And he wielded eyes of fire
His voice full of growling howl
Turning the back from his people lies
Running again into the deepest wood(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Taranis arise
Camulus arise

Barinthus arise

to hunt the Jute and angle scum
we stand as one, against the Christ, the plague of  Rome
a cancer among us
Aarrrhhh

lost gods we call on you x4
lost Gods we call on you x 4

the gods will die only when we forget, in times gathering dust
our ancient remains shall call out and say, in you  alone we trust

Gods we call on you once again, to rid our land of  our foe,
to remind us once more of our blood, our might
of our ancestors long agoDo you see the frozen nature?
Do you see the mirror on ice?
Yes, I see...

I see the ravens in (the) black sky...
When lakes fell the frost
When the snow falls on my soul
When the forests are on fire
I see the nature...

Oh, Khors - give me the strength!
To kill the enemy inside of me
To destroy the lie of Jehova
To feel (the) fire of war...

I see the buring man with (the) horn - he isn't man - he is a god:
God of sunlight, god of life and reality...
This god lives in me.

I see him every morning
And he dies every night...
Khors will come to shine
My soul will see the light:
Light of fire, light of reality...

One day all forests shall be mine...
One day all people will die...
One day the nature of our ancestors shall rebirth!
I will burn the flame, one day...
One day I'll see the death, one day...

And Sun god, listen to me:
Light your powerful flame and please -
Burn the heaven and earth!

Oh, almighty Khors...IN THE LAND OF SUN

Many people think that all will be ruined,
After his tragic departure in silence. But,
Like any father, who kept his legacy
He left behind to me: "To V - to victory!"

And now, from Valhalla in the role of observer,
Watching honestly follower that stayed clever.
For message from the heaven we're feeling the devotion,
White revolution is the only solution.

For you to shed a million tears,
Rest in piece Dr. William Pierce!

For you to shed a million tears,
Rest in piece Dr. William Pierce!

But, movement is working and slowly is widen,
Hail Resistance and Hail National Alliance!Humiliation no longer
cross your daring quest
set on the run
you crave after rest
Abomination to weak
entwined your soul to crime 
Blindfolded faith
is holding the line 

Welcome the stirring world
be brave and bold 
play for (a) higher score 
As reaching beyond the top
where no one can stop
your demands for more

GATHERED AS ONE
BOW TO IDOLS OF TIME
ENVISION THE PAST PASSING BY
PROGRESSION'S BLAST CAN'T SINS
TO BE UNDONE 
TRAPPED IN FALSE DREAMS
WE'RE E-MAZED AND STRAINED
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR LIFE GREAT

Unleash the fury
blow out a doubt in raging gale 
no turning back 
only the best prevail
(but) Running out slowly
time comes to pay for dirty deal
great but enslaved 
you're (the) servant of will 

Facing the endless may
you're leading astray 
in day by day game 

GATHERED AS ONE
BOW TO IDOLS OF TIME
ENVISION THE PAST PASSING BY
PROGRESSION'S BLAST CAN'T SINS
TO BE UNDONE 
TRAPPED IN FALSE DREAMS
WE'RE E-MAZED AND STRAINED
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR LIFE GREAT(Instrumental)Cold grim winter landscapes lifeless they seem
though lifeless they are not
Cannot see the trolls hiding from their fate
Thor will crush them all!

The staff I carry carved with runes
guides me through these mountain roads.
In ritual of the stones Wodan told me I'd behold...

Grimness warriors cloaked in black garments,
riding the skies screaming in terror 
Agonizing the common folk,
warriors undead by the grace of the lord of battle.

Faraway echoes resounding
Faint screaming voices breaking the silence
Horns and war drums sounding in the night,
chariots of fire illuminate the sky
Drawn swords appear on the horizon, banner soaked in blood

See the grim faced warriors in the night sky, 
peasants be aware because your horses are going to fly
See the grim faced specters in the night sky,
warriors of the Oskorei!

This furious assembly thus descends, I can smell the blood on their swords and axes
It smells familiar to me, fills me with the desire to fight, feeling like I'm amongst my brothers I've lost in the storms of ages
Long forgotten times, so sad to see my folk Christianized

Mounting my horse I feel an ancient pride returning in me
My warrior soul dead for ages now comes back to life
My horse rearing leaps into the sky to leave the old behind
Riding the winds, faithfully we follow Wodan as he leads us through the night

Riding on the wings of the wind
riding towards the spectral blaze ahead
The fiery bridge linking the worlds,
flaming tongues around horse's hooves 
Outlined against the horizon we see the silhouette of Heimdall waiting...

Raising our horns filled with ale,
we are seated on hundreds of benches
Rows of warriors side by side,
praising his name while singing out loud:

"We are the hordes undead by the grace of Wodan, remaining in his hall, awaiting our time when we go out to ride!"


Draugluin '98/'99[I.]
Finally the time came
In that our revenge is taken
All are coming on this day
More than 1000 swords and spears

We will use the shade of the night
To implement the first attack
We will get them when they sleep
None may survive or escape

Have no fear oh my befriends
I will march ahead at the front
We get which to us belonged
To live in peace, in piece again

And in such a way we reached
The castle of the enemy
In such a silence they do sleep
And now we let the fire burn

These flames will our country clean
With sword and shield we are storming
In the morning red you die
A mournful day for you all

[Chorus:]
Burning arrows fly by air
We march against the enemy
The air it burns and iron meets on flesh
Our opponents can not resist
Our attack is a full success
We got them in the sleep
We fight for our liberty
Independent again

[II.]
Now the gates broke through
We are storm the inner court
The against resistance
Of the enemy is weak

We will take no one
No one as a prisoner
The base is taken nearly
The clan and its fellows flee

The sun comes up slowly
The new day bring back us our land
The land we lived so long time
The land we are want to dieing for

Smoke rises on to the clouds
Hundred's dead bodies lay
Laying down on the ground
The liberty demands its victims

A general is in our hands
He will tell us of their plans
The torture will bring him to speak
And the victory be ours

[Chorus:]
Burning arrows fly by air
We march against the enemy
The air it burns and iron meets on flesh
Our opponents cannot resist
Our attack is a full success
We got them in the sleep
We fight for our liberty
Independent be again(Instrumental)(Instrumental)No matter which future you'll give
To the h-reign
On the wane or on its rise towards the summit
The die is cast!

No matter the awakening of conscious
Or total abandon
The gangrene has set in
And the sly poison is incurable.

"Qui de vous a jete la premiere pierre 
Sur l'edifice de la conscience humaine?
L'epineux souverain votre sauveur
Et vous l'avez suivi!"

No matter what offerings you'll leave 
Imploring at the altars
Sacrifices decimate you,
Making you murderers in the infamy's pay.

No matter which god you worship
Cause you'll all be equal in the realm of death.
You first have to die
In a wide human genocide

The beast has come from the never to achieve his soulless annihilating work
"Come here, come here to be given the sentence of infamy!" 
And from its mouth receive the last baptism that will mark the end of our era
In a blood magma made viscous by your corruption.Mistres, my beloved princess
Like fairy you dance oh ! cherrie
Your beauty is of emeralds
A vision in the flower fields
I play my lyre as I feel your fire

I sing my choirs to infinity
Leave you all heralds of her primacy

I invite the beasts I gather the wolves
together we dance all in the woods

In vines when you walk
With my tunes to Gods I talk

I make mountains cry
To me birds and volture fly

In vines when you walk
With my tunes to Gods I talk

To my life you're so precious
Your smile is so mysterious
What fate is holding on ?
Without you I can't do on
Solitude I don't wish
All I need is a bloody kissRunen gekerfd in 't bebloed lemmet, een blijk van 
geloof in Alvader.
Mijn verwonde lichaam reeds verhuld door
sneeuw.
Ik betreed de vlammende brug Heimdal ziet me 
al komen.
Mijn eer voor hem die wijsheid heeft
verworven gespietst voor negen dagen aan de
Yggrdrasil.
En het ene oog geofferd voor een dronk uit
Mimir's bron.
Ik ben Uw zoon van Midgaard's ras, O vader leer
mij Uw liederen!
De zonen van Muspel zij zijn gebonden. Maar de
tijd zal komen wanneer kettingen
bezwijken.
Asgard's hallen besmeurd met 't bloed van
Goden.
Maar verval zal  toch ontspringen in
wedergeboorte!This world was never mine
It was cursed by those who brought the eternal
Struggle those who live their lives in total vain
Destroyed the holy tree of life (so the dead leafes are falling)
But a new emperor and order shall arise from
The ashes and scars

Crush the unholy faith
Burn their book of lies
Kill those who will stand by the crumbling
Cross of weakness

The withered tree will once again spread its
New roots deeper in the soil
(and thus create a new fountain of life gods have blessed
the emperor and he will bring us out from the shadows)Immune
No more
From unruly traumas
And scary 'nevermores'
The ego sore is.

Ubi Sunt / Qui Ante Nos Fuerunt /

Foremen of cunning,
Poverty below
Both tremble before it -
A magic unfathomable.

Were one to know the asylum,
Would he flee
From hollow darkdays of humanity?
The blade of strife
Its image is cold
Yet, pruned of light 
Is the face of the old.

In hoax,
Not by hoax
Passive life is led.
The difference is not
Once the blood will be shed

Sic Transit Gloria Mundi(Instrumental)I See christian blood shed.
I See my sword in victory, with glory.

I Hear, screaming in the air.
I Hear, the voice ofpagan man.

Now it is our turn.
Christian burn!!!

My ancestors gave me
honor and pride and
i shall give them revenge
and sacrifice.

Blood, fire the vengeance of iron.
Blood, fire the vengeance of iron.In agonal sighs of the dying-away October
The fire of a forest decline is reflected 
In the melted gold of fallen leaves
Uneasy winds become colder, and shadows are extended

We're going to circle near the forest burial mounds
From it appearing the strong shadows of the dead, 
The patrons of our tribe and folk
And they require sacrifices, like fading forces of nature

We put before them the heads of the Roman soldiers,
Who killed druids and cut down the sacred groves
We share their flesh with the spirits of our ancestors
And sprinkle by their blood the cold autumn ground

We raise the bowls made ??out of their skulls
And drink the blood of our fallen enemies, 
Washing by it our faces and bodies

In the reflection of the disk of cold moon 
We are holding hands, moving around in circle, 
And our chants echoing in flattering thickets, 
From where a lot of luminous evil eyes watching us

And spirits of our ancestors dance with us
Erased the line between the spirit world 
And the living world in Samhain

From a wide circular stone altar rises 
The swirling tall shadow with deer horns
In triumph he spreads his palms to the October night sky 
And by his pointing finger, he dawns on us!

Great god of wild forest, Cernunnos, we greet you! 
Veiled in darkness 
You are who topped with deer horns, 
Lord of the lower world, 
Of forest trees and beasts! 
Praise to You!What is lost from the times of elders wisdom?
So many unrevealed secrets...
enemy has buried them in deep depths of their rotten souls...
Is there a time for a new awakening

To feel hatred
to feel anguish
its like you live in eternal pain (yet I desecrate them all)
To hate my enemies
to make them suffer and bleed
that is what I creed and in the end is my joy...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)As the wind blows and the fire burns
The night whispers old stories from time untold
About all those things that should not be talked
Written in words of an ancient tongue

So come and sit... Next to the fire
And feel what this humble tales inspire
Listening carefully... Listening aloud
All things that should not be shout

To think about times untold
To understand the things that shall come
To fight with pride and defend our reality
Of Pagan Tales and Antichristianity...Your perception of the world
Is nothing but a dogma,
The vision of life -
Just raving delirium.
The senses melt together,
Your voice is
Just a shrilling whine.

The sickly gist of things
Has opened my eyes,
I'm only one,
And the reality's in me.

The empty, wretched world
Consumed by fire,  
I'm Lord, I'm God  
Reality is just in me.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)The caucasian race was born to govern all others
Proclaimed itself as the stallion of all creation
Sowing seeds of hatred
No price for the perfect offspring
Heterosis, revival of our world
Natural fertilizer
Hybrid consuming flesh
Return there back to save all pretty creations that remain
Endless decivilized concrete avenues
Meaningless symbols of prosperity
In contempt of cultures
Enslaving process if you don't progress
Heterosis, revival of our world
Natural fertilizer
Hybrid consuming flesh
Inspired by visions of a disintegrated future
Fancy for authenticity
Dehumanize the world by globalization
Ensure the purity of progeny
Heterosis, revival of our world
Natural fertilizer
Hybrid consuming flesh(Instrumental)Tears are shed so many, as rivers they depart.
Yet tears alone cannot suffice to mend the oaken heart.Vision of the weak 
eyes of the false
Burning their filthy cross

Manipulated by Death
The lies shall come to rest
bringing power and pride back to the land
for equality is not for Man!

Pathetic Beliefs are in their head
Is all the worthless prophets are Fed
Dragged into an Endless Hour
For only we have the Power
There slaves are nothing but cowards!

Lower the race to An End
The Rotten will surrend
Slaughter them all
the culture will slowly Fall

The Time has arrived
They will be deprivedBow to the book 
 Reverence the ill 
 Crooked verses of the ancient 

 The wise as farse 
 The blind shall lead, 
 Disposable beings. 
 From the gallows hang the unobedient. 

 Bow to the book 
 Reverence the ill 
 Crooked verses of the ancient 

 Before Thy Eyes we don't exist 

 We don't Exist 

 We 
 The forgotten 
 The denied 
 Creation from your own entrials. 
 The biggest lie. 

 "We are the kings of dirt, 
 We are the exiled sons of Eve."I am the Black Death
I am the night prowler
The curse that creep amongst you men
Prophetor from darkness
Messenger of evil
The poisoned thorn that will cause the decay of human race
I hate you rapers
I abase you when I terrorize your nuns
And when your prudish daughters
And sisters sell their souls to pagan cause
Under the assaults of my tongue and my rod
And league with me soul and body
I am the infection
I am the gangrene
I spit my venom of soul and bodySilence in the woods
Nobody seems to be here
Black ice covers the floods
Cursed the count, show no fear
The knives of revenge are waiting to kill
At darkest night the blood to spill
Enemies are slaughtered, never to be found
Their mutilated bodies buried in the winterly ground
See fear in their eyes 
Thats the reward for your lies
Your fuckin hearts I pull to pieces
I love your death screams sound
I broke your bones and cracked your heads
The Pagan madness heres around
I eat your guts and soak your blood
The first time it colours the snowy ground
First winter of bloodred snow
Victory for us or the grave below
First winter of bloodred snow
Join the Pagan killer show!!!As I climb the icy glaciers
I see a mighty sculpture
Frozen winterlands, northern winds
Babaric races left to conquer

The everlasting fields of snow
Realms of eternal coldness
Ravendark comes forth the night
Hedenks folk left to plunder

Destruction of the norse lands
The age of ragnarok arrives
Destructions of the norse lands
Our soul remains there carved in ice

Destructions of the norse lands
Frostbitten kingdoms shall remain
Destruction of the norse lands
Their warriors shall die in pain

High upon my mountain throne
I watched the lands destruction
Our conquest nearly complete
Only Asgard won't surrender

Artic landscapes before my eyes
I hear screams of toture
Bashing through frozen city gates
I feel ragnarok aproaching

Brother Loki comes to our aide
The light of day is dying
Elder ones reign aigain
Ygdrassil has fallen

The dawning of a new age arrives
Gods no longer order
Norde lands shall florish again
With me as their leader

Destruction of the norse lands
The age of ragnarok arrives
Destructions of the norse lands
Our soul remains there carved in ice

Destructions of the norse lands
Frostbitten kingdoms shall remain
Destruction of the norse lands
Their warriors shall die in painAt nightfalls dreaming of them
Far away lands heathen

At nightfalls dreaming of them
Black nights cults within
At nightfalls the roaming sounds
of thunder striking down

A mystery of thousands of years
The cult of the dead the cult of the misery

At nightfalls there the river flows
At nightfalls the river styx glowsI am a star- awakened by a new life
To trample the icons of weakness
Fullfill my nihilism to behold the awareness

I, crowned and hallowed offspring of myself
I, prometheus, fire and rebellion
Fire of microcosmic vibrations
Fire through the pentagram of myself

Through the crisis of the weak, i conquer my fear
Rapture, as i become other
To a new age for the celebration
Of the symbolic birth of the superior ones

Lux-fer (hexagram 33): my will divine
Projection of wisdom and power
The seer: " thou'll be reborn,
Warrior of light crowned in glory and love"

V.i.t.r.i.o.l.Welcome in the individual world
This paradoxe lets me down
What is the reason of this nation
Super-corruptor exists for your desires
I need supremacy
The illusion of the beast on the throne
I want the magic of creation
Just a rumor of my elemental control
Hey you, what do you want?, what do you want?
A part in my existence's bubble?
I woll ot let the humanity
Searches his joy in mine
A war desires is natural
The reflection of our obsessions
Internal power to reduce poors souls
In state of inertia
War desires
War desires
Our imagination persists so!
To erect needle's tower.
We know that no one will survive
To this event we're calling life...
And the time leads man
And surpass our obsessions
War of worlms
The battle of hypocrisy
The war of snow
To add to our humanity
After all these serial failures
I understand my departure
Out of the program, I'm condamned to the viewer's rank(Instrumental)[Music / Lyrics: Bill Leeb / Rhys Fulber]

In silence they scream
How needless they suffer
Dying for the freedom
But someone has to pay
No one hears their agony
The torture and abuse
Simple human dignity is lost in the fuse
While the rest of the world
Smiles in all it's horror
Crushing all of mankind
For profit, greed and glory
Will no one help those
Who believe in compassion?
This equality of life
Is just not a fashion
They hide in the shadows
The torture goes on
This permanent sadness
They have to be strong
They suffer in silence
The fighting goes on
This permanent sadness
They have to be strong
They won't be forgotten
One day they will rise
Eternal devotion
Their souls will fly high
This engraving cesspool
Which man has devoured
Is slowly getting to
The very last hour
In silence they scream
How needless they suffer
dying for their freedom
Like Christ's last supper"father, oh father
let us flee
back to the mainland
far away from Crete
we will not stay here
in this prison
we will go home
to be free"

"my son
I will
build wings
to escape
from here
we will go
through the air
over waves"

Daedalos built wings to flee
out of wax and feathers they shall be

"father, I know
not too high or too low
I'll do what you said
to learn to fly
we have to go now
I am behind you
do not worry
I will be fine

beautiful sun
let me touch thee
I mastered the air
now I will master you
look I'm coming close
I am stronger than you
i will claim you all
for myself"

"Ikarus,
not so high
you will fall
look your wings
start to melt
to fall apart
you will die
and let me alone"

the surveyed tried to be
like a god and so he died

"sun you traitor
you lured me
to come to you
to give in
I am just a man
not a god or a king
just Ikarus the fool
who died of hubris"(Instrumental)(Instrumental)A child cry in the forest
Wrapped in darkness
A virgin take him with her
Hold in one arm...
The sob child begin to suck
Her turgid tits...

When estiu appear
Innocent deceptive luxuria
When Estiu appear
So made it be in us

Sits near the fireside they stand
Her virgin's cunt begin to wet
Beholding  down on child's legs
She see goatish hoofs
So he burst out an evil laugh
And run away!!!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)My days are grey like dirty snow
 The fire's burning in my soul
 Why should I live, love dying in pain
 My death is Reaper's gain
 
In solitude I can not tell
 Just of my deepest sorrow
 All time that's left is freezing me
 I'm waiting for tomorrow
 
The fire in my mourning soul
 Burns all my feelings to the ground
 And all my hope has gone away
 I simply will decay
 
Of war in mind I ran away
 The chaos lies behind me
 On desert plains where I can't see
 The golden bright sun blinds me
 
No strength to help to break the spell
 This curse that grinds me down
 My mortal life runs out of me
 I'm dying on my own
 
The fire in my mourning soul
 Burns all my feelings to the ground
 And all my hope has gone away
 I simply will decayRiding from the battle, wind in my face
Thunder crackling in the distance
Carrying the word of the High King's death

To his end, he lied a thousand times
For killing my family

His head placed on a stone
A flag for his treachery

And when the sun will shine on my lands
The light will be pure and true
When my kin return and live
Orghlaith will blossom proud and freeThere was a night - the only night that was real
I felt like the chosen one
But there was no thunder, there was no lightning
So I thought I were dreaming on

Chorus: Straight on through the gates of heaven
Evil will destroy the souls
Where's your saviour, where hides Jesus
Why isn't he at war against us

Darkness around us was so siezable
Black blood running through my veins
We know: what we did was unacceptable
But our hearts were by evil love chained(Instrumental)You! Come here and listen to the tale of the last men on Earth
Approach and see the lament of a decadent age's remains
You! Look at the future you building full of despair and fear
Do you really want to see your child with only ashes to live?
You! Man full of meanness regain control of your life
It's high time to start thinking the world you will settle
You! Look at your reflect into the mirror of life
Do you really want to see a man with no conviction?

We thought the Earth was eternal, we were not thinking of tomorrow

Here is the tale of a man who live the fall, we were all bind outdid by our own wealth

We burned the Earth like a woodpile
Ignoring any common sense, making money more important than life
But one day the sky became black
The air ignited and the Earth fell over

I cry! I fall in despair... This is not the life I want to live

You! Come here and listen to the tale of the last men on Earth
Approach and see the lament of a decadent age's remains
You! Look at the future you building full of despair and fear
Do you really want to see your child with only ashes to live?
You! Man full of meanness regain control of your life
It's high time to start thinking the world you will settle
You! Look at your reflect into the mirror of life
Do you really want to see a man with no conviction?

Here is the tale of a man who live the fall, we were all bind outdid by our own wealth

I cry! I fall in despair... This is not the life I want to liveSorrow stricken
Writhing in her grave
In this world of lies
Close her weary eyes
Spitting sorrow
From the cup of war
In a blinding rage
With a deadly hate

Iceni Queen unfurl'd
In a tempest of crows
Deep in the underworld,
'Til the world falls dead
Iceni Queen unfurl'd
In a tempest of crows
Deep in the underworld

You never had a chance
Just a dead woman walking
My battle Queen
There's no use crying
Over what could have been
To die un-avenged
We all die alone
Drinking poison

Iceni Queen unfurl'd
In a tempest of crows
Deep in the underworld,
'Til the world falls dead
Iceni Queen unfurl'd
In a tempest of crows
Deep in the underworldSons of Hecate 
walked in atmospheric dark. 
Lived the forceful darkness.
Breathed the forest life. 
Fell deep into witchcraft. 

Sons of Hecate 
Sacrificed to their own mother. 
Wondered by her might. 
Dwell in a cold small cave. 

Sons of Hecate
Posed the ancient wizards. 
Thoughts of the Goddess 
found her dark meaning, 
about who they are. 
And proclaim the Gods about her sons.(Instrumental)Am I to die a death of shame
Forlorn in dark miasma
To die a death of blood and flame
Cut down by euthanasia

Chanting shaman battle cries
Oaths of vengeful ire
Druid fiery baleful eyes
Like soulless pits afire

Under this, desolate night
Our blood chilled with fear
Riding from the nether gloom
Death is ever near

In frenzied battle slayers fall
In a hideous sullen dance
Plunging soulless dogs to hell
Cut by sword and lance

Battle Queen on burning pyre
How grim a life abhorred,
Her croaking throes fade to dust
Her dignity restored

Grim Queen of terrors
We summon you,
Take our Queen
Into forests dim
And the gloomy hue of time.

Shimmering shrouds
Of pallid clay
Before my eyes I see
Frost unsharpened
Gates of grey
Where tears are ice
And flow no more.Multitude of aspects of every being
Of carnal or of transcendental
Multiplicity of prisms is attributed to everything
But the Universe is a Unity

Ages ago the Noble men
Lived in harmony with Nature
Which is far from false divisions
For the Universe is a Unity

False prophets from the East
Have torn the Day away from the Night
They have created good and evil
When the Universe is a Unity

Body and soul make the Man
Man and Woman create new life
The balance of Elements
Lets the Universe be a Unity

Ruins are the new foundations
Death purifies the Earth for the next generations
The Universe is far from the moral judgements
For the Universe is a Unity- MOURNING SWORD -

Forged into a world, of endless war,
Baptised in the cold blood of thousand men and gods 

Runes over its blade, showing the way
Of how this doomed world will reach its final day

Slave to his fate, Elric the great
will carry this sword and a steel chain of hate

Mighty duke of Chaos, Arioch, lord of hell
When the moon brings tides of war I call thee
Dragonisle will collapse, bane of the dark sword,
Scythes of doom will strike tonight,
the curtain descends

Sailors of fate, dragons will chase
Ships crushed in flames
End of an age, Gods scream in pain
Cry of the mourning blade

I am the sword called Stormbringer
With horror in their eyes, they called me souldrinker
Made to kill everything in my way
Even some Gods have felt my blade

I can see the agony in your eyes
As my powers begin to rise
Your soul farewell body and mind
And it becomes totally mine(Instrumental)From the mist covered mountains to the vast forest of the east,
Men seek the answers to life but many forget the simple truth,
Come my friends, time for another drink,
 
From coast to coast,
May the mead flow true,
And the dawn never come,
Until we are done,
 
Once again the candlelight flickers, come on, while the night is still young
Time to quench our mighty thirst, with our brothers fallen or no,
Come my friends, time for another drink,
 
From coast to coast,
May the mead flow true,
And the dawn never come,
Until we are done,(Instrumental)(Instrumental)God, stupid redemption of a fallacy
You represent the ignorance and mediocrity of the human race.
Immaculate lie you base power in the intimidation and terror.

Deity of a miserable era.
Deity of a mediocre kingdom
Deity enthroned over a lie
God of all fools. 

I challenge you god of the Jews
I will dishonour you before the look of all your sons.

Deity of a miserable era.
Deity of a mediocre kingdom
Deity enthroned over a lie
God of all fools.

I will be your hangman, I will be you biggest fear
I shall be your pain and the suffering and agony of your immortal soul. 

I offer you forgiveness in change of your submission
I will give you power and dominion in change of your indignation
I will drink your blood and I will degrade your soul.

I am the one who will takes your throne and I will brake your false image.

I am the one, who hates jehova, my name means denigration your actions
I shall be the one who hates your existence
I am the extermination of your creation.

I am the one who will takes your throne and I will brake your false image.Na Severe, v predgorii gluhom

surrounded by majestic peaks,
built at giant rocks,
the old walls of the frightening fortress are standing

many dark princes reigned
at our mighty castle in the forest
thousands of brave warriors died at it`s rampart
and drenched the mountains with their blood

hundreds of battles the knights stroke,
desperate fights for power and immortality
in union with dark forces
the magnificient building got unconquerable

our mighty castle, since more than onethousand years
a sign for war, death and ruin - unbendable
against the hated enemy
it got the symbol for destruction

just today we`re standing at our majestic fortress
icy northwind is blowing through the abyssed walls
and we are looking
into the white snowcovered country

steamed through by this cold night
we feel the anger of the warriors
and hear the battlesound of swords and axes,
out of times long ago in the halls of our fortressIn der letzten Vollmondnacht
Meines Daseins
Spure ich noch einmal
Den Hauch des lebens
Als das Blut aus meinem Korper fliesst
Niemals werde ich erfahren
Was liebe bedeutet
Niemals werde ich erfahren
Wann die Menschheit zugrunde geht
Als ich in den deinen Armen liege
Erblicke ich dunkle Wolken am Himmel
Die Vorboten der Holle
Am Abgrund der Hoffnung
Erlichst das licht Gottes
Als die machtigen Nordwinde
Mich zu meinem Sterbebett begleiten
Zum letzten mal sehe ich aufs Meer hinaus
Das mir fuhrer Kraft gab
Mein leben zu ertragen
Die Schmerzen der Wunden sind ertraglich
Ertraglicher als der Gedanke
An mein vergangenes irdisches leben
Den Tod kann mir keiner mehr nehmenZeus rains upon us 
And from the sky comes d
own 
enormous water
Rivers have turned to ice

Dash down the water
Throw a log on the fire 
And mix the flattering 
wine and bind on round our foreheads 
Soft ceremonial wreaths of spun fleece

We must not let our spirits give way to griefI was drowning in a dying moment
Drowning in her eyes
Feeling the wings of faith embracing me
So unreal but I could feel
The yearning to ther divine beauty
A voice was sounding far away
Never dying
In the distance heard
The wind calls her name
My burning flame...Not a dogma, but knowledge and feeling
Mark the road to Perfection
So, go and tread this path to glory

Two ideas - and yet one
Two names - yet of one thing
This is the way to Unity
This is the way of Warriors

Reject dualism - accept creativity
Reject superstition - accept both sides of the coin
You will thus serve the idea of the One
The One who is the Almighty Nature
And its light and darkness

The Divine Nature, the Elements
Ancient, yet still living Gods
These make the idea of Unity - the idea of power
The idea of the One of many faces
Many archetypes melting into One

If you are strong, you will prevail
Carrying the idea of the One
Who is the Gods of our Ancestors

Emblem of the Sun and emblems of the Night
Will merge into One

In the rustling of leaves 
On the rippling of water 
On the flight of birds 
Signs are abundant 
For those able to see 
Secrets uncover, whole worlds unfold 

I know the gods and all the fair ones 
Know their good and know their mischief 
I can spare life, be of great help 
Be destroyer, burn like fire 
Call me light one, or the dark foe 
I'm no longer, not of your world 

Faces in tree bark 
The hiss of the fire 
The roar of the wind-blown 
In the absence of sound 
You see the birds fly 
I see the truth 
You hear the birds cry 
I hear their words(Instrumental)Prim rose weaved in sacred leash
thy forbidden mien nears sorcery

but cloisters gates guard chastity

Abjured years of mortified lust
sworn to serve your lord

harbinger of righteous wrath
I pray for on pagan blood
All for you

Children who lived in delusion
ablaze they sob your name
heathen brides pray deliverance
All for you

Still you refuse me
still you disdain me
I will be your martyr
All for you

Prim rose...

Rival of the son am I
lachrymal atonement streams
crusader bleeds in belfry
but your heart I still won't reach

I will be your martyr
All for you(Instrumental)I am the one to convince you you're wrong
Spill the message and still remain strong
Entering battle with others in stride
Stronger we battle-scarred victors!

Inconsistent Constantine, bent like a reed in the wind
Abandoning convictions, to unify his land
The symbols of his Pagan faith, morphed so to thrive
When stupidity prevails, to unite it to lie!

A sacred circle, black strength to sorcerers will

I am the one to convince you you're wrong
Spill the message and still remain strong
Entering battle with others in stride
Stronger we battle-scarred victors!

When one leader dies, another thrives, pass the torch
Perceived to rule for all, he only rules for one!
Change the conspiracy, to rule for me
To rule for ALL truthfully, summon the storm!

I am the one to convince you you're wrong
Spill the message and still remain strong
Entering battle with others in stride
Stronger we battle-scarred victors!

Ever before and never again, we meet my friend
Never again, will we bow to them!

We raise the wind in the Devil's name,
It shall not lie until we like it to rest again!Born under the word of God 
Lived under the sign of Hell 
Died praying to no one 
Seeking no forgiveness 

Bathed in the blood of the christian whore 
I am the sin even God himself could not pardon 
The adversary of his holy light 
I am darkness eternal 
What will you do oh ye of utmost faith 
When your savior has abandoned you? 
To whom will you pray when you've lost your way 
and you demons have consumed you? 

I am your destroyer of worlds 
I am your grand deceiver 
I am the one who whispers in the night 
I am your god-damned devil 

Where will you be when the war has begun 
and the angels fall from grace? 
Better to die on your feet 
than live begging on your knees 

I am your destroyer of worlds 
I am your grand deceiver 
I am the one who whispers in the night 
I am your god-damned devil 

Born under the word of God 
Lived under the sign of Hell 
Died praying to no one 
Seeking no forgivenessWhat is this that brings the light to me? 
What is this that shines so bright? 
Please come with me to the fields of green 
Please come with me by my side 
Hello darling 
Be mine darling 
Tonight darling 
Tonight 

This is me who brings the light for you 
It's my knife that shines so bright 
I will never say a word for you 
Not a word in world is right 
Goodbye darling 
See you darling 
See light darling 
Goodbye 

Here they lie who know the light -they lie- 
Here their bones that shine so bright 
Let me kiss your tender naked heart 
Let your flavour make me tight 
Tonight darling 
You're mine darling 
See light darling 
And shine(Instrumental)Adanc de mormant, cenusa din suflet 
Licar de jar se aprinde in bezna 
Ma avant in inalt, urmat de-al meu cuget 
Ploaia astrala mi-e fresca rupestra. 

Inchid in slove salbatice forte 
Stihii ancestrale fara de nume 
Suntem spirite transformate in torte 
Dinainte de veacuri, departe de lume. 

Imbrac ca o haina cenusiul din nori 
Neantul divin mi-e tainica sete 
Mori inainte sa mori, sa nu mori 
Darul primit sa nu te imbete. 

Adulmec tacerea si gust din Lumina 
Cu vrednicie trec punti din inalt 
Cumplit uragan mi-e fruntea senina 
Iar zborul in lacrimi de sete il scald.(Instrumental)On the inside
Underneath the flesh and bone
On the inside
I'm a king, set upon my throne
With no-one to tell me
That I should fight for their cause
I set aside this world
Ignore the raging wars

I feel a peace
Sitting inside
Living tissue
That will heal this issue
I feel a peace
Sitting inside
Living tissue
That will heal this issue

Find my way
Through razor wire
Find my way
Through the raging fire
Peace dwells in this broken man
Deep down, I feel a hopelessness
Beneath the courage, is a restlessness
I hold on to the hope
I'll swim beyond the temporal lobe

Do I speak the truth
Can I still see
Am I the pariah
Do I give in to desire
Do I speak the truth
Can I still see
Am I the pariah
Do I give in to desire

Find my way
Through razor wire
Find my way
Through the raging fire

Deep down, I feel a hopelessness
Beneath the courage, is a restlessness

Peace dwells in this broken man(Instrumental)I wake up to find everything seems to be 
Exactly like yesterday. 
Sunshine caresses my face, 
Brightness comes into my eyes. 
I walk normally. 
Nothing seems to disturb 
My slow steps forward 
that lead me to a man in white 
speaking about my fate... 

All I ask is for a voice 
Before the dusk. 
I want to embrace 
The coming night 
Smiling one last time 

The walls come close 
As I can't seem 
To understand why. 
Tears in my eyes, 
fear in my soul, 
rage in my hands! 
The dusk is close 
And my heart sinks: 
I am alone! 
I feel insane. 
Could this silence be all I have? 

All I ask is for a voice 
Before the dusk. 
I want to embrace 
The coming night 
Smiling one last time 

All I asked 
Was for a smile 
Before the dusk. 
Now I embrace 
The newborn night 
With tears in my eyes... 

The dusk has come 
My eyes now closeI wake up to find everything seems to be 
exactly like yesterday. 

Sunshine caresses my face, 
brightness comes into my eyes. 

I walk normally. 
Nothing seems to disturb 
my slow steps forward. 

That lead me to a man in white 
speaking about my fate... 

All I ask is for a voice 
before the dusk. 
I want to embrace 
the coming night 
smiling one last time 

The walls come close as I can't seem 
to understand why.By oak, ash and thorn....we crafted our village
By stream, harvest and herd...we fed our clan
By sweat, tool and seed....we cultured our land
With strength, honour and will......we fought for our race

(chorus)
Now years have passed
And some forgot
Our ancestors
Our mighty Gods

With sails, oars and ships....we tamed the oceans
With armies, fire and steel....we conquered the world
With greed, evil and lies....they tried to bury our Gods
By strength, honour and will......from the ashes we will rise!

(chorus)
The years have passed
But we'll never forget
Our ancestors
Our mighty Gods

This is the oath we have taken
For the allfather
For the great mother
For our blood and soil
For oak, ash and thorn!!!Remind me of the past
The time of warriors
When one could fight
With freedom of triumph at war
Honour and majesty

The days of a master
Teaching an apprentice
Before global warfare
And mass controlling superpowers
A time of honour, gone

Technology was not yet
Though it is never needed
A free spirit would walk
Doing as it pleased

In these days of pending darkness
We barely notice the changing seasons
The smells of nature
A feeling of real life
It floats by, almost separately

For nothing now we are
And our time of honour, long gone...(Instrumental)Stains of blood upon their teeth
Crushing bones beneath their feet
Human flesh on which they feast,
Rabid mouths foaming with decay
 
Rise, from the mountains come
Hide not from the light
Come forth from the darkness
Feast upon manflesh
 
Through the fog and mists they roam
Onwards to devour their prey
Marauding creatures spread pain
Nought but ruins lie in their wake
Villages turned to dust
Cities lain to waste
All behind them barren
Scorched lifeless wasteland
 
As the trolls march forward
Consuming all in their path
Now is the age of the troll,
Guardians of the deepest abyss
 
As I see them approach the castle walls
Fear touches my mind, my doom is decided,
But still I face them, with courage and bloody steel
The last thing I will ever feel the rancid breath of the troll
 
Now is the age of the TrollThe time will come and dark clouds fill the sky
sun is sinking down for the last time
A skin of ice is covering earth, eternal night is born
We have taken what we could, and we gave nothing

Refrain:
"Mankinds arrogance and mankinds vain
is changing into fear, into chaos and into hatred
and from hatred into pain

Nature's revenge, and old ancient power
cold winds are blowing and dark clouds fill the sky
Frost and full moons empire of coldness and thousands
of glaciers so mighty and high
Nature's revenge, and old ancient power
cold winds are blowing and dark clouds fill the sky"

What shall we do, this is the end!
We saw the signs but we ignored them!
What shall we do, why are we so weak?
There is no return, we will lose it all!

Kingdom of coldness, kingdom of darkness
Stormy winds and ice rule our earth
Kingdom of pureness, kingdom of nature
A perfect creation, a birth of a new world

Time is there and cutting winds fill the sky
The crimson moon is shining and revealing the old paths
A skin of ice is covering the earth, eternal night is born
- this is the birth of a new world

RefrainHe was born
As a lonely beast roamming without herd
Alone with his feelings
Dawn moments mirrored the fog
Opaque
As a throny bush in the deep of a forest
In the soil
Inside his thoughts worms mauled him
He was wandering in labyrinths of caves by day
In enourmous wilderness by night.
Patience
Which is pain was a weapon for him
As he was bron to be a butcher
And laughing together with death
At the memories of a sick race
He was never be seen
For blind are the ones created by god
He is known
To walk among them and judge for the first time
Kills the one who's chosen
by his only mate.
DeathI leave the white fields and trees of Olcanath
To my horror in the distance I see
A woman tied to the rocks
I ride as fast as my horse will take me

What I did see would rend the heart of every man
My love dead strewn across the rocks
The waves cry in unison
A lament that only I can feel
The tears burn my face
Loss in every form
I fall to my knees

Tearing off the shackles, that had her across the rocks
My love died in my hands
I shatter the rocks with my sword
Lost to the madness, from your loss

I will revenge you Brianna
Till my last dying breath
I will not stop, I will not wait
I will kill those who you took your life!A Monster Revealed: Chapter VI of Chikatilo

[written by Marc - July 2001]

Part I: The Arrest

On the day the monster was arrested,

He had with him a rope, a knife, Vaseline.

A search of his apartment found

Twenty-three knives, a hammer, shoes

That were found to match the footprints

Next to an unidentified rotting victim.

Police had trouble believing that the gentle man

Was responsible for the brutal series of crime.

Part II: The Interrogation

After his arrest, photographed and interviewed

Before being placed in an isolation cell.

The next day interrogation started in earnest.

But any hopes of an early confession were dashed.

One week after the questioning began,

he wrote a letter to the Prosecutor General.

While falling short of a true confession,

his statements gave an insight into his mind.

Unable to break through the mental barrier,

A psychiatrist assisted with the examination.

Ten days later, he broke into confession.

Describing into chilling detail how he had

Tracked, raped and brutally killed his victims.

Sometimes removing and eating body parts.

Transported across the country, visiting the scenes,

Where he had committed the revolting murders.

Part III: The Trial.

The trial began half a year later.

Locked inside a specially designed cage.

Six months passing by, the court reconvened.

Found guilty of fifty-two counts of murder.

On February fourteen, nineteen nine four,

Andrei Chikatilo, the Butcher of Rostov,

Was executed by a single shot

To the back of his exposed neck.From the highest summits
Bitten by impetuous winds
To valleys enshrined in snow
The tribe rides elder paths
The Sons of North
Carried by their steed, nostrils fuming in frozen dawn
Galloping from collars to crests
Enfeoffed lords in a mortal world
Carrying the banner of the ravens
Masters of immaculate tops
Living memory of Nordic lands
Last keepers of the Heathen faith
The proud hordes defy the one god, nothing can soil their ancient beliefs
They gall the sky of their hoof, grazing heaven of their swords
Their tribal chants exult such an anthem to the battle
Protecting their fatherland, till' the snow be redden by blood
Shadows of the ravens plane over the mount and valleys
The gallop of the war horses will rumble loud once againThe question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
To leave you behind?

The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

If I told you I'd get you through
I'd have to let you fall down

Not because of malice
You needed to
And I'll remember
What we had

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain(Instrumental)De doornen van de rozestruik
bedekt met wat sneeuw
zijn het graf van een eenzame
hooploos, gestorven rillend van kou
en desillusie

Ontnuchterende beelden van algemeen verval
sporadische hoop, evenveel keer
genadeloos de grond ingetimmerd
gestorven, rillend van kou en desillusie
van laat maar waaien, 't kan me toch niet meer schelen

De doornen van de rozestruik
bedekt met wat sneeuw
genadeloze tekens, bijtende wonden
in een zinlos bestaan

Het graf nav de eenzame
een enige hoop
in een verlorn strijd(Instrumental)(Instrumental)On All Hallow's Eve in Fort Mead
In the shadow of the National Security Agency
Away in a mainframe, no crib for a bed
Born and bred by Propellorheads!
Snow Crash ensconced you as a prophet
Silicon Valley copped it to profit off it
Mysteries with just hints of SF Twists
Sealed with a kiss, language virus!
The Command Line Is The Beginning, where does it end?
Quicksilver writing with a fountain pen
Decode and encrypt! Decode and encrypt!
And write! Write now!(Instrumental)9. Beyond the Stars

Beyond stars and skies
Their pain come to us
Colder than death, heavier than rocks
They were born into wind
Horror and war
Take their souls for ever
Voices from the frozen past
Lead me towards blood
Proud warriors of the golden age
Give me your sword and your rage
I am already seeing
The burning churches
No mercy and no tears
It'll rain wolf blood
Beyond stars and skies
Their pain come to youRohom otca urody
Pred tvojimi tvarami
Uctou, cnostou skloneni
Vladni svojimi synmi.

Chlebom darom, nad dary
Mece i ohne slabsie nez ty
Byciou tvarou,
Prosom i vodou, stromom i podou.

Zemou i vodou ...otca Velesa
Ohnom i nebom Peruna.

Bojom i svarom ...otca Velesa

Ved po ceste k Rodovi.

Fondly Farenheit! 
4,217,409!I wake up at night
The sea is calling
I should wait till mourning
But something inside tells me to go

Dark waters, cold winds
Am I still dreaming?
I brought the sword and shield
My father used to wield
And the hammer of war
Made from a fallen star
A gift from the dwarves
To fight an ancient evil

Hail, hail, death or glory
It has awaken again
So the spirits say
They whisper my name
And say I am the one

Tonight we will write
The end of the story
Death or glory
Which one will I find in the end?
Hail, hail, death or glory

It has awaken again
And the sea creatures know
They show me the way
That I have to go
Tonight we will write
The end of the story
Death or glory
Which one will I find in the end?

The day has come
For so long everyone has waited
Now I stand alone, bow to no one
The time is right
Now or never, no more waiting
All my choices led me here
To this moment

Tonight we will write
The end of the story
Death or glory
Which one will I find in the end?From south to north, from east to west
I walk and walk but my soul can find no rest
from day to night, from bright to black
I march and march on this neverending track
from birth to life, from life to death
I carry on and on till I draw my final breath

From here to there, from there to here
I walk and walk but there's still a pressing fear
from near to far, from close to strange
I roam and roam in this wide and boundless range
from day to night, from bright to black
I carry on and on and there's no more turning back

Through forests dark and old
on long forgotten allies
in nights of frost and cold
through narrow, misty vallies

On mountains high and steep
in wide and open spaces
in waters dark and deep
through all different kind of places

And everywhere I roam
I'm a stranger with no home
there's a pain inside my soul
and none can fill this hole
my forces have all gone
but still I carry onFirst there were only the depths of the sky 
No heaven, no earth and starless nights 
No life, no darkness and no light 
An eternal emptiness and no time 
And a giant had to die for the new world 
His flesh became the soil, and his blood the seas 
His bones became mountains and stones 
And his head was the heaven with its clouds 
Then there were North and South, heaven and earth 
A dark abyss and icy streams 
And they caught the fire and made the stars 
The time was created - night and day 
And so the mights of the world were created 
And with the seasons time became an eternal flow 
Living and dying, fading and growing 
Till tomorrow they will built the piles of the worldShe spoke of the dichotomy
'twixt nature and technology
Her hainish stories began
and ambitious chronology
Some authors should teach a course
On deviant psychology
Her course would be
Cultural anthropology
The Dispossessed is a masterpiece
of anarcho-syndacalism
The Left Hand of Darkness held
Gender analysis and assured feminism
You were always coming home
to all aspects of utopianism
Will earth survive
To justify your optimism?
Ooh Ah Ursula!(Instrumental)Birds sang sweet in the silent trees.
Two lovers sat beneath their leaves.
Gaily we laughed just to hear their song,
held tight within the spell love weaves.
As children we danced in the Summer sun,
red light shone in her golden hair.
Her skin was stroked by the gentle breeze,
the days passed like dreams without a care.

But jealousy grew in their twisted minds.
They said witchcraft had made me blind.
"Such beauty cannot come from God,
devil's child, Daughter of the night".
So the soldiers came, took her away.
I watched the tears fall from her eyes.
She begged for mercy, begged them please.
They turned their hands, ignored her cries.

Broken as she'd fell from the rafters,
hands tied back ripping sinews inside.
Numbed to the pain where the needles went
and the soldiers who stole her sweet honey at night.
What is this creature they drag from the cart?
Naked and bleeding, broken limbs hang limp at her sides.
Where is her red hair that once held the sun?
Shaved and ripped out in the name of their Christ.
Only the bruises and cracked dried blood
show where her sweet face used to be.
Split by a toothless gash, swollen and bloody.
Her puffed out eyes have no will to see.
Numb from the pain, too weak to stand.
The crowd spat and jeered as they dragged her by.
They took her and tied her to the log.
A solitary tear fell from her eye.
The flames licked at her purpled flesh.
Blackened, blistering bruises burst in the fire.
Not a scream, not a single cry, yet I feel her pain.
My heart rides with her on the pyre.

And in the smoke which rises from that raging fire
I see her face, pure and sweet as I'd remembered.
And she whispered to me, "My love, we'll meet again".

Ride on the northern wind like a raven, she calls my name.
From the raging blaze and the pain she'll rise again.
For those who died in the fire we'll take revenge.
We'll stalk in the shadows as wolves to slay the lambs of Christ.(Instrumental)Glorious land of plentitude
Its people of multitude
Fields and the mighty rivers
Were the cornerstone of the Nation
Impossible woods watched the ends
Sheltered people and their secrets

Unending history goes on
People had formed a Nation
Now only trees are humming
About the glory of the Founding Fathers

Waves of the northern sea
Carried by salty wind
Wash the face of this land
Stones of history lie there
Amber - silent witness of events

Amber born in the sea
Where great trees shed their tears
Those that were humming here
Before the child of man set his foot in this woods

A state was created, wide and invincible
Amber retains the sleeping spirits
And might of the Founding Fathers
Who shall find the power to awake the Heroes?

The one who solves the mystery
Through prism of honey stone
He will find the way to those who passed
He will find the power to future struggle

In the youth of this state
Amber became the key
To the great hall of history
Spreading its honey glare
To route across the River
Gold of the NorthStorm Wolves
They came with many thousands 
and they came in the night 
They came with foreign flags 
and brought us to fight 
Burning fire, burning houses 
but we never losing our pride 
Again we march in battle 
we all side by side 

We are less but we are strong 
we are brave and they are not 
If we die in battle 
with the sword in our hand 

If we will fail we go to Walhalla 
and they go to their hell 
We are immortal 
we will ride with 
the Valkyries some day 

With blood in our eyes 
we are storming in the night 
No fear of death 
under Wotans sign we born 
To Walhalla we ride 
for wictory and glory 
My blade is cutting 
the enemies veins 
we are storm wolves 
in the night 

Storm Wolves 
Strong like stones 
Storm Wolves 
Fast like the wind 
Storm Wolves 
Axe of the gods 
Storm Wolves 
Cold as ice 

We are less but we are strong 
we are brave and they are not 
If we die in battle 
with the sword in our hand 

If we will fail we go to Is the clouds of gray
In the realm of sea
Lies a mourning forest
Crysten fade in gray

It's dweller's had lifted
No birds chirp in it's clouds 
The whispering roars of the wind
Had left it no sound

Well these years gone by
The forest fell asleep
Remembering elder days
The sewers driven deep

When the sky wasn't gray
And the sun was black
But it's time to face the truth
Those days will never come back

Over the centuries
The forest passed away
The well callen roads survived
To rise when times would changeBeholding the old reign fall a legacy is lost
Before the arrival of the waves and winds
Quiet in the woods of ever crying shapes
Twisted in remembrances
I saw the fall of the caves
The home of the first forefathers
When men returned as beasts
To serve to an unknown fate
A legacy is lost
The whispers of the gods fed the ground
When the ravens of Lug appeared
With fury and passion they taught our world to fight
They taught what pride means
And the wolves ruled my land
With howls and chants
I was there in lament
Now this legacy is lostTHIS IS THE NECESSARY INTERLUDE YOU STRIVE NOT TO SEE
THE ENLIGHTENED STEP WITH NO MORE MERCY
THE NEEDED REVELATION FOR THE NEW AGE TO BE

I don't imagine what i will find
It would be easier to escape bat my feet sink

It s hard to recognize the places
There are too much, questions that i don't understand,
I dig up through my life

The time of the suffering has finished
Now the hate remains
Time wasted to run after nothing

A stone instead of the heart
At the end i discover why
I have found myself

I'll arise again and i'll carry on the fightI See The Ravens Fly Again

I'm escaping more and more from you,
And disappear in a cosmic coma,
Leaving behind me human absurdity.

We'll give you Hell tonight

This time we'll come to you, cuz - 
Burning until you can't burn no more 
The wait is now all through 
You've met your maker, soul taker 
This time he's come to you, cuz -It was a time of noble blood
Black from the ground it would flow through their veins
Songs of an abundant universe
Would dance on the tongues of both peasant and king

But when the fires burn out
Will they wear the same chains?

Arise
They deck themselves in furs
Soon to forget what was what yesterday
And wars will seek forever more
Slaves for the slaves that are freed from their slavery

But when the fires burn out
Who will wear the slave chains?

A fisherman in Finland
Tell the story of a king
Who set upon mother nature
Every living thing
Dressed in peasant clothes and love within his heart
He sought to place a crown upon the salt of all the earth

He saw a peasant
Leading his horse
And asked him this question
Do you know of a land
Where the sun always shines
And the grass is so green
It's like living a dream

''Over the hills
Over the seas
Only through the curtain of death
Lie our riches
And there alone''

The king dressed as a peasant know he could better all gods
And spoke of a salvation on the plains of middle earth
Over the hills over the seas is your destiny
Where wheels do turn as darkness burns
And black blood carry thee
Laughing at gods they rode away into the wonderland
Where all was in abundance
And all like them were crowned
The horse rode with his peasant king
Beside him in the trap
The straw was gold the lights burned strong
They never once looked back

The weight of ages borrowed would no need paying back
The peasant king through down his crown
And turned back to his land

But his horse was fucking useless
And thought itself a king
So to get them back he took up the slack
And pulled the trap himself

Passing
Motionless carts
Human and horse
Skeletons in furs
Equally willing
The reins to move them
AlongAnimals have these advantages over man: they never 
hear the clock strike, they die without any idea of 
death, they have no theologians to instruct them, 
their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome 
and unpleasant ceremonies, their funerals cost them 
nothing, and no one starts lawsuits over their wills.The eternal flow of the tear
The flood of the jackalian cry
Millions of voices are calling my name
Me. The King. The I

As I stand here in the head of the river
Millions are flowing past my eyes
Their voices are calling my name
They're awaiting me

Jackalian cry

The era of the jackalian cry
The everlasting flood of the damned
My millions of voices are calling
Them, The Damned(Instrumental)I see the blood everywhere, corpses of mine laying here 
I can't believe what happened, this is just a complete nightmare 

And for what, all this slaughter? 
And for what, all this hatred? 
You murder for your beliefs 
Only causing this circle of hate 

And we just dig deeper this chasm of ignorance 

I see the blood everywhere, corpses of mine laying here 
I can't believe what happened, this is just a complete nightmare 

We spent our lives to fight each other, killing our brothers, raping our sisters 
Our beliefs split us instead of joining us, we build this chasm between our ignorance 

And now we bomb your homeland 
And now we kill your brothers 
This is a storm of pure anger 
This is a never ending war 

And we just dig deeper this chasm of ignorance 

I see the blood everywhere, corpses of mine laying here 
I can't believe what happened, this is just a complete nightmare 

We spent our lives to fight each other, killing our brothers, raping our sisters 
Our beliefs split us instead of joining us, we build this chasm between our ignoranceIn the land of the black sun 
The land never won 
The journey has begun 
To do what was never done 
The land full of sorrow 
The land full of pain 
Where there is no tomorrow 
And the tears of fallen Rain 
Lightning shoots down across the land 
Thunder shakes the ground 
Fire spits down from the sky 
Into the forests unknown 
Where the evil await your arrival 
Approaching the forest 
You watch closely 
For movement in the forest unknown 
With your sword close in hand 
Awaiting the battle to come 
Approaching the forests unknown 
Where the light is not shownIn the halls of the battle slain, proud warriors living here lie, choosen to rise once again... under Asgard's godly skies. Where the heroes' feast is had, lie Odin's ever watchful guides, above the open fields... with the quivers of selfless life. 
Bountiful life... Bountiful life. 

For kith and kin they now lie, where in death comes life's reward, those chosen for their will to die... sacrificing for the folk of Migard. Valiant to the call of the Valkyrie and the will of the eternal Weir, they rode to the battle and decreed... that death's gift should not be feared. 

Bountiful life... Bountiful life... Bountiful life... Bountiful life. 

So take these gifts of our father's past, and live the live of Odin's breed, fearing never that this life won't last, for better rewards in Valhalla await thee. If you fear not the path least tread, and take the path by few trodden living always by your words once said, and the wide and endless... ...horizon.

I soar on wings of my predestination 
Above all morals and sins 
With glance of damnation 
I comprehend the guilt 

And every damned will receive 
What he deserves 
And everyone is cursed 

I am Lord Avenger! Behold! 
Here comes the tempter and exposer 
The Day of Judgement now gets closer 
I am Forefinger of the God 

And every damned will receive 
What he deserves 
And everyone is cursed 

I bring redemption to the World 
Detecting cravens and aborted 
And every infamy will be rewarded 
I am the Omen of Downfall 

And every damned will receive

Of slaves atrembling in their temples 
The God of Vengeance I recall 
My Ark will float on waves of ashes 
And blood 

And every damned will receive 
What he deserves 
And everyone is cursed(Instrumental)In the time of swords and axes
In this Eeried Ogre time
When martial men ravage on earth
When the forest was dark and sombre
And the Northern fighting spirit was alive
Time of swords and axes
Age of pride
Swords shall be raised
For the ancient view of hate
I see the beast in the eye of them
Who suffer in the present time
This glorious and pathetic age
Let us crush the sacred temple
Unholy hordes whit evil mind
From the darkest age in time
Come back and fill the world
Whit malignant powers of ancient
The age of pride
Dreadful longships sailed the sea
They plumber and spread the fear
Whit combat harried horses they ride
For the sunset
Warriors whit a hope to see their gods of war
Their gods was their hope and inspirationAnd so it begins..
My eternal quest for solace

Bleak Horizons
Looming grief
Heart hardens
Grim journey

'Cold and bitter winds surround the Wanderer. There is no love in his heart, or hope in his soul, he marches forward with an anguished fever...'

Armed with my fury...

Marching onward
Into the lands of shadow and sadness
Suspended in arcane torment...
My sordid dreams haunt me endlessly...
Haunt...

Whispers from beyond call me..

Spectral warning; 'Traveler of the northern abyss, these hinterlands are home to vile and unforgiving spirits. Your quest is a perilous one...,

Final heed: 'Wanderer of the ancient cult, you've come to seek the truth. There is nothing in these shadowlands but ancient and evil peril! Your dreams have steered you wrong, this is the final heed, turn back now...'

But still I march on...

And so it ends
Solace was never found

The grave fields call my name
My unfulfilled pilgrimage

Tortured and lonely soul
My only companion...Zich 15 maal per dag
hetzelfde feest voorstellen
meer moet dat niet zijn
meer moet dat niet zijn (refrein)

Langzaam dwalend
door de nacht
de schaduw opzoekend
die mezelf verblindt

Aftakelend
dag na dag
tot het echt niet meer verder kan

Refrein

Een schrijn van stille wenkt
een schijn van uiterlijke rust
inwendige wanhoop
duizend stemmen beuken in m'n hoofd

Een wardig afscheid
vreuge
de ballade van bengelend aan de koord

Refrein(Instrumental)Welcome to the bog, where silence reigns
Their existence ends here, it all comes to a halt ...

No place for cowards
No tolerance for the feeble
No respect for the unjust
No life for the unworthy

Along this deserted trail
Bordered by pagan idols
They take their final breath
As the noose is tightened

Kill them for Wuotan!
Kill them for Donar!

Feel your life slip away, darkening before your eyes
Feel the chill of the bog, becoming one with you

Welcome to the bog, where silence still reigns
Their existence ended here, it all came to a halt ..."A pure race of warriors and wises
Together in soul mind and heart"

Prepared for war
With arms in our hands
And the truth in our worlds
Covering the land
With the enemy's blood

Warriors are prepared
Prepared for war...
The warriors are screaming
Screaming revenge... War!!

Priest come true
The divine sacrifice
Drinking your blood
Eating your heart

The heads of the enemy
Are in field of the battle
We want your blood,
Blood and pain...

The warriors are waiting
Waiting for revenge
And screaming together

This is mexican fucking rules!!Hear me, gods of the storming sky 
Come and lead my folk on the path
Which lies among the stars
Your might will guide us to greatness

The two lightnings of your might
Strike down the Christian worms
The two lightnings of the might of the
GODS OF THE STORM

Set your hate upon those who bear the mark
Of the cross where their feeble messiah died
Torment them with the scourge of your vengeance
Regain the honour with what they took from youI am reality into the silence, the power
inside you. Atman or the power
of the great inside god.

I flow in the universe into the silence
I flow in the abysss... ATMAN! I possess
the cosmic key, in the gate I await for you.
You will choose the way
to the trascendence, is our mystic union.

Maybe the warmest hell where hammer
your sword? Maybe the biggest sky
where shout to the winds?
Or maybe you will prefer
to navigate in a sea without ATMAN
Energy inside you meditate and flow
with me, cause I am superior own.
Or continue to kneel
in presence of your idols.

Repeat chorus.Steadfast as a weathered mighty stone
Weary of this furious raging storm
Defy, and resist the endless war
Withstand, and uphold the sacred law

Though I may faulter on my journey
And I will suffer pain with time
I know I'll keep my head up high

Bring forth your gods
Your sacred strife
With truth I crush your wretched life

Roots so deep this oak will now be swayed
Core unwavering, edges burn and frayed
Enduring as all else wilts and wanes
Earth-red blood is coursing through my veins

Steadfast!

Noble, Glorious
Ever victorious
Entwined everlong
Steadfast forever

Loyal is this friend who rides with me
Ever true companion reigns supreme
Smashing all deluded false belief
Laughing at their feeble self-deceit

No one can take this strength away
I will resist the fearsome tide
And I will keep my head held highLet ravens feast on dead
Hail the father war
Beneath the sword of cleaving faith
Beneath the cloud of vulture shade
I could taste your tears
But homes in flames burned my tongue

As brothers we shed
As brothers we bled
I could see your fear
But smoke of pyres stained me blind

Hail the father war
Hold thy ground
No knight on horse shall pass
This spear sown grass
Hold thy ground
We starve another day
To breathe and prey as slaves

Hold this land
No man shall ever heed
Your cross shaped leash
Hold this land
Earth gave us birth
Our blood we give in return
Blood we shall return

True to gods of old
Yet betrayed by demons of pride
Once we sacrificed
All laws for moments respite
Gold they yearned, sweet promise served
On honey venomed feast
When winter passed all north was burned
Peace was for deceased

By the ruins of trampled hope
All we lost, triumphs we sought
Near heralds of armed despair
Side by side against this tide
Let no one fall to blazing fright
Fear - it reaches deeper than spear

Hail the dying god

Never we kneel
Never we flee
Death over peace
And death shall rise us free

As brothers we bled
Now brothers in death
To seize the final breath
But my soul is no longer hereThe Eagles, they fly so high
Monitoring all with strong eyes
Swooping down on Middle-Earth
Mighty and wise

The Eagles fly
Friends to Gandalf
And enemies of Orcs

Upon Orthanc, Gandalf laid
By wings of mighty, he was saved

Oh the Eagles, they will speak to him
To help the cause and kill through the wind

Above the mountains they fly so high
They see all with mighty eyes

Long before Men they lived
Looking over the ground beneath them
In the final battle they fought
From skies above

The Eagles, they fly so high
Monitoring all with strong eyes
Swooping down on Middle-Earth
Mighty and wise

The Eagles fly
Friend to Gandalf
And enemies of Orcs

Upon Orthanc, Gandalf laid
By wings of mighty, he was saved

Oh the Eagles speak to him
To help the cause and kill through the wind
Above the mountains they all fly
They see all with mighty eyes(Instrumental)Kids who kill (2x)

Life's a badlam, misunderstood children

Dangerous minds with intention to kill

Harmless appearance hiding cruel desires

Young psychopath in a perfect disguise

Chorus:

Raped from their own blood-twisted thoughts (2x)

Resulting from barbaric sexual intercourse

Impulse to kill starts with slaying birds

Beating my brother, picking the dog

Traumatic experiences with horrifying consequence

"I have to kill! You are all my enemies

Let me be and you may live

But don't be sure, shozophrenic habit

One mixture nice, the other bad

Bloodlust in your eyes"

Inner might forces you to take up the knife and to strike

Voices in your head reminding of memories

That'llforever remain inside your brain

"You like to come with Daddy?"I'll do you no

Harm, so please trust me" Ruled by perverse

Tendencies, not able to overcome this urge for infantile sex.

Chorus

"Daddy, keep away from me, I love you

But not this way, please don't hurt me"

Traumatic experiences with horrifying consequence

Pain and mental agony never to be healed again

Perpetual damage leading to kill

Not enough to kill my father, I need to kill all fathers

Psychological conflict

Kids who kill(2x)With the last stop on your long way in
sight, and the preview of a metamorphose
into rotten flesh, you''ll deny your god and
sing this last song:
"A divine comedy, about god''s insanity, as a
grotesque theathre, based on hypocrisy"

+ Reverende Pater, benedic me, quio volo
confiteri peccata mea coran domino et de
Dominus Jesus Christi, sit in orde tuo et
super labiis tuis et sincere confetearis
peccata tua

+ Dominus noster Jesus Christus te absolvat
et ego, auctoritate Ipsius, te absolvo a
peccatis tuis. In nomine Patri et filii et
spiritus sancti Amen. Vade in pace

And now you embrace your pagan gods, and new
illusions you create, but after a while your
dogmatic conformism, makes your Odin the new Christ...

Requiem for your long dead god, as a shama-
nistic prophecy, a pagan ceremony for the
buried god... you''ll never find ''m back!

Requiem / Burying your gods forever... and ever...The day darkness faded away
A well of emotions sprung out of your heart
The rain fellt warm and brought new life
And nothing could tear us apart
There will be a time we will win the struggle
for a fair life for every living creature
Our richness is our wisdom
To see behind lies
and to find the real way
to ourselves and eachother
I cry with your tears
You share my emotions
we're all one
Nobody's better, noone is lessDown below the darkness
Where shadows fear to fall
Cast out of all graciousness
Dwells the usurper of hope
Trapped by its own ambition
Victim to its own greed
It lies in wait, for all who have fear
On the emptiness it feeds

Down below the depths
Down among the dead men
Laying in the emptiness
It's not if, but when
It's not if, but when
Danger is for certain
The examination of ruin
Cast out of darker hell

Crowned the usurper of hope
It searches the farthest reaches
Unending universes
It lies in wait, for all who have fear
It won't be long til we bleed
Made for one purpose
Crowned king of hatred
Annihilation its only plan

Free will eviscerated
Down below the darkness
See systems of control
Wearing the death, divine
It answers evil's call
Denied, failed condition
Plant the demonic seed
It lies in wait, for all who have fear
To dominate, it's only need


Down below the depths
Down among the dead men
Laying in the emptiness
It's not if, but when
Made for one purpose
Crowned king of hatred
Annihilation its only plan

Free will eviscerated
Made for one purpose
Crowned king of hatred
Annihilation its only plan
Free will eviscerated
The usurper of hope
Crowned king of hatred
The usurper of hope
Crowned king of hatredIt is now our time to rebuild the cities of the fallen men
But we can't found our new world on the base of the old one
We must now rethink our place in the immensity of the space
We must reinvent the way we live in this world full of ruins

I fell the spirit of the night rising up in my hands
I finally have the courage to erase by fire!

All the lies of the past, all the nonsense of the men
Will be destroy by the primal power of fire!

But we can't found our new world on the base of the old one
We must now rethink our place in the immensity of the space

Knock down the towers of the greed, the roads of the laziness, destroy the witness of the past!

All the lies of the past, all the nonsense of the men

Knock down the towers of the greed, the roads of the laziness, destroy the witness of the past!
No more machines of envy, proofs of gluttony, let ends the pride of lust and anger

I fell the spirit of the night rising up in my hands
I finally have the courage to erase by fire!

All the lies of the past, all the nonsense of the men
Will be destroy by the primal power of fire!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Someone from high is always
building your mind
And watching you
by a demon's eye
No time for a thought
when the orders are a lot
If you will swerve then you'll die
Maybe it's the god
which is made by the mob
Spreading dread all around
Forces of hell marching
straight on the road
But the reason
it's never been found
Bridge:
Run for your life
Wait for your shadow
Run for your life
Wait for your shadow
Chorus:
Isolation, through your soul
Ordination, play this role
isolation, through your soul
Expectation, a self control
Now all your life
it's shining like a silver knife
And sticking the beast in the dark
Running so fast
passing troubles of the past
Crashing the tooth of the sharkMiserable life lived in silence 
Conforming to the laws of man 
Holding his emotions deep inside 
Slowly driving him mad 
His bones start to crumble 
His eyes begin to glow 
Unleashed is the evil inside 
Ready to takes its toll 

Crawling through the streets 
Hunger for violence 
Seeking to commit evil deeds 
Abomination among the earth 
On flesh it will feed 
Malicious mutant out for blood 
Reeking havoc in the night 
People scream in torment 
As it terrorizes all in sight 

Years of torment and anguish 
Had created this creature of hate 
Its eyes filled will blood lust 
The result of a man gone insane 
Bursting from the flesh 
Is the evil from within 
Releasing itself upon the earth 
Eager to seek its revenge 

Crawling through the streets 
Hunger for violence 
Seeking to commit evil deeds 
Abomination among the earth 
On flesh it will feed 
Malicious mutant out for blood 
Reeking havoc in the night 
People scream in torment 
As it terrorizes all in sight 

Sinister growls in the dark 
Nonstop vicious attack 
The creature maims and slaughters 
unsuspecting fall to their death 
Consuming brains and blood 
On its infernal strike 
No end to the torment 
Killing through the night 

Crawling through the streets 
Hunger for violence 
Seeking to commit evil deeds 
Abomination among the earth 
On flesh it will feed 
Malicious mutant out for blood 
Reeking havoc in the night 
People scream in torment 
As it terrorizes all in sightTormented eyes are watching from the sky
As celestial pagan blood flows
The candles are burning bright
To open the gates of eternity
Summoning the dark gods above
Ancient powers cast against their will
As the altars are left caressed in flames
The invocation of your soul

Wander into the cave of darkness
Ancestral chants are faintly heard
Blurred visions corrupt your sight
Sacrificial omen of the ancient ones

As the blood drips from your eyes
I drink and praise to the death
Her cold skin starts to shed
A sacrifice of timely unrest
Endless temptations arise to befall
A paradox flooding mother earth
The hollow years become the past
Endless forests consumed by plague

Wander into the cave of darkness
Ancestral chants are faintly heard
Blurred visions corrupt your sight
Sacrificial omen of the ancient ones

"...Casting the sacred rituals
And gathering the energy
The fire burns so bright
Bring forth your ancient spirits
The magick elements of runestones
They forever align the stars
Blood flows from this void
As ancestors of eternity..."(Instrumental)Spells are cast the flames burn high
The mistress is out for blood
The angels bleed release my seed
The bile soon will flood

Smell the stench of evil tonite!
The Vomit Queens is ready to strike!
Give it to me - Vomit Queen
It's bursting out - Vomit Queen
Give it to me - Vomit Queen
Aaarrrggghhh - Vomit Queen

All hell's let loose the puke it flows
There's no turning back now
Taste the vomit from Baphomet
To no one I shall bowDrowning in silence, in embrace of dusk 
You follow your way to nowhere; 
Devoured by your demons, destroyed by vile sins 
Your star no more shines above... 

"Hear the void deep in your soul - 
Black plague that possessed thee! 
Follow your way to death and decay - 
To plague, that possessed thee!" 

Behold now your visions of past, 
As empty hopes turned into dust; 
Greet the new day - 
An ominous path to decay. 

Feel presence of Death by your side - 
Nowhere to run or to hide; 
Pray for new day - 
An ominous path to decay! 

"You worshiped their values, believed in false gods 
And followed the rule of a herd; 
But vessel was broken and sailed to maelstrom, 
Though you did not notice the leak." 

So face unavoidable death - 
And spare for that time every breath; 

You've wasted your life, 
Building prison of souls 
For yourself... 

Embrace the end! 

The stars above lightened for you arcane worlds 
But you have preferred to crawl on the ground like worm 
Forgotten, 
Forlorn 
And torn. 

"Far beyond your life 
Hear infernal voice 
Calling to domain 
Of decaying souls!"1. Howl of the Iron Bells

Ring, ring the bell
Tale your blade our iron shells
Get ready to vomit
Burn their flesh then spit on it
Time is down for wreck
Beating, slaughtering, breaking their neck
A deep slow cut
In unprotected stomach
Howl, howl make the bells howl
Terrifying sounds breaks dawn this dawn
Under symbol of our unity
Already commemorating(Instrumental)Neptune almighty
Lord of all source of power
Alas the conception of
All source of life and his devour
My mind flows across all waters
Like it flows between the oceans
Like it flows in my veins
I am the river of time
And the sea of space
I never die

And my soul starts to fly....
Oh the land before the waves 
Oh the where nobody can save us
Oh the land of mystic shades
The lost knowledge of Gods

Nautilus the source of all divinity
Long forgotten across the time
But in time he will be remembered
Nautilus transport me to the other side
In the ocean I will be remembered
Sub float inside the sea
The waves crush between the sand
My mind blows 
This is the endA dusty flute played Mozart a brace of pigeons on the window 
Sill shit down on the statues of abandon heroes 
They didn t care that someone will dust off 
The statues and uplift them to heaven 
The years-longs dance of flies 
around the useless crap will begin 
This story has an end as well 
The statues aroused dislike, got covered dust, 
and cobwed curtains and pigeons to shit on them 
again Dust off, set up love, get disappointed, hate, 
cover with dust, abandon, and crap on...Attention! Attention! This is a great sensation!
All channels broadcast a very important event!
People lost world domination.
Nature shows to us dissent!!

Coming terrible disasters.

Water will come out of the coast washing away all in its path.

wrath of heaven crush on cities.
Awakening volcanoes shake the earth.
Storms and whirlwinds will blow all along.
People want this and You want this.

It's time to pay for everything. For all that you have neglected.
Hear the voice, hear the call of all living things.
You are slowly killing them. Now they will kill us all.

This is the end of humanity.

Harmony! is not difficult to be able to strive for it!
Are you scared? Want to scream and cry?
It's too late to apologize. Late to change anything.
World consumes oblivion. Nowhere to go.

Last cry silenced the fall last drop of blood.
River of tears dissolve us.

Last cry silenced with the fall last drop of blood.
River of tears dissolve us.
River of tears turns into a flood, 
washing away human genus

This is the end of humanity.As the sun is sinking red 
Throws last beams out to the river 
Silently and cool the twilight comes - 
And all that has to come...Crossing the empire of the unlight
Forsaken chambers beyond time and space
Ever-present ancient spirit of the divine
Force of the ultimate chaos and night

Mind of the eternal traveller
The spirit of the immortal origin
Wanderer of the paths of uncreation
Slowly sweeping to the damnation

I am wandering the great garden of stars
Breath of the dragon, serpent of the abyss
The Astral stream of the river of Aether
Eternal spirit of tharaphita, take back your race

For the wisdom and knowledge of the unearthly reign
Piercing every part of my dualistic existence 
Through the vast presence of my spirit and soul
Refflecting to the one that shall be left behind

Contaminated heart of the black soul 
Mournful son's search for the void
I close my two eyes, the third one will shine
Enter the passage, leaving earth behindHere in the width of wild northern nature
here in the calm of mystical silence
here is the place where I belong

Here in the light of autumnal colours
here in the cold of merciless winters
here is the place I call my home

Then here in the north
the gods placed a kin
of men with light hair and shining skin
and here in the north
life formed this tribe
to men of honour and pagan pride!

Here in the width of wild northern nature
here in the land of fairies and giants
here is the place where we belong

Here in the height of snow covered mountains
here in the shades of mighty old forests
here is the place we call our home

Then here in the north
the gods placed our kin
of men with fair eyes and shining skin
and here in the north
life formed our tribe
to men of honour and pagan pride!We are here and we are there
In the atmosphere
We are here and we are there
In the atmosphere
Immortal, eternal
We are here, we are there
In the atmosphere(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Lumber churns it
Wrath bears it
Fire is the past
Its embers extinct
Dead.

Lumber churns it
Wrath bears it
Torment is the present
Naked, nude
Skinned.

Lumber churns it
Wrath bears it
Mighty future
Pure, black power
Chosen.

Cutting fire's embers to death
To feel the nakedness of pain skinned
Let mighty pureness be guarded by
chosen ones.

Sew up you mouth, indigent one
Let your eyes burn together

Your body and soul be more foolish
Live through pain and pitfall

You are trampled down, dusted
A mighty torture for you.Beneath the screams of the fallen ones, 
surrounded by a breath of fire, unmoved I stay.
Engulfed in an armour of eternal hate I await
the shining flame. Oh Warlord, I serve to the darkness reflected in my empty eyes. 
As I rise the sword of tyranny to the marble sky see the clouds die, with the whispers of the weak, hear the cries of forests. With a frozen hand I carrry
the banner of salvation, to transform it in
a symbol of pain and mistress.
For ages of unholy night
For ages a dark visions
I'm the bringer of dark bright
Passing through the deepest of my
chaotic thoughts I search an answer.
Nailed with the thorns of it's beauty
Drowned in an ephemeral cry
All purity of God lies dying, I'm the
conqueror of thy shinning Paradise.
Enchanted by the Moon.
Awaiting for the call.
Embrace the darkness. Black is the
only color that can see my eyes.
Embraced by the death.
In eternal anguish we are.
Like withered rose we turn to dust.
Through milleniums humanity is weeping.
The pain is the crown of ignorance, an...
ignorance is the thorn in our face.
Praying... Believing in a divine light.
No more tears will spill my frozen eyes.
No more prayers to that filthy cross.
All purity of God lies dying and
I am enchanted by the night.
No saviour can save us.
An existence as sad as the rain
in a cemetery. Thunders sing
my demise. I can't weep no more.
I'll rest below a crimson sky, 
drowned in an ephemeral cry.
Abandoned and forgotten.
In the grief of the Earth.
As the sorrow embrace us
we walk in loneliness... Forever!!!(Instrumental)Carved in the stone
The magical power is transmitted
Mysterious and secret
Searching our spiritual roots

Recovering values from our ancestors
Celebrating a glorious past
In which wisdom is immortal

Immortal wisdom

Arcane knowledge
The heritage of our ancestors
From the mythical source
The immortal wisdom was born

Recovering values from our ancestors
Celebrating a glorious past
In which wisdom is immortal

Immortal wisdomHow many times have you
Wiped blood of heroes from your hands?
You brought death in our ranks
Picked many comrades from our side

Daughter of Budli
Born in catastrophe
Destroyer of Gjuki's sons
Breaker of the oath

In the land of Goths
You sent Gunnar down
You gave Agnar victory
And earned the wrath of Wuotan

Imprisoned in Skatalund
Surrounded by flames
Awaiting that hero
Bearer of Fafnir's goldnow go to sleep
take Hypnos' present
let your eyes look deep
to pictures Morpheus sent

tomorrow you will see
the world in another way
realize, admire and pray- BATTLEROAR -

Just before darkness falls
A beast cries out a battleroar
A roar coming from the past
Warriors live again at last 

Metal lives in our hearts
In our blood, in our minds
On fiery chariots from hell we ride
A conquest for eternal life

Now, open your eyes
And see the darkness turning to light
While burning fire rains from the sky
There will be no one left to survive, no

When gates shall fall
And Gods will hold the flames of those souls
Who praise and keep the faith of an oath
Of sacred metal, of Battleroar

Feel the cold steel cutting through your flesh
Into the battle
Brave to the end fight for what you believe
Into battle

Oh, never fall, standing tall
Battleroar
Strong raise your sword, scream and shout
BattleroarWhen the moon is high 
Your shallow graves 
Shall feel the light 
And you will rise 
You are not slaves 
Life is your right 
You cannot break 
You will take flight 
You will survive 

Take to the sky 

You walk with a heavy heart 
And don't know how to stop 
Everything is dark 
The voices only grow 
Their whispers corrode your soul 
Your mind cannot let go 

Fire burns bright within us all 
We stand and hear the call 
Of shadows in the light 
We have to stand and fight 
To let the sorrow win 
Would be the gravest sin 

Look for the dawn 
Seek out what's bright 
Misery will try 
To drag you deep 
A twisted sleep 
Don't ever go 
When whispers roar 

When you are eclipsed 
And feel so cold 
Remain transfixed 
Take one long breath 
Let light take hold 
Stand fast and strong 
You are not alone 
Don't hide in dreams 
Fight for your peace 

The right of life(Instrumental)The clouds hang heavy in the air - The air it smells like rain
I lie here waiting - Fever dreams - A shelter from the pain
Not long ago I was alive - A man so full of dreams
Now soon the dark will fall on me and death will set me free

I have no fear - In limbo trapped - My life so far beyond
My mind so blank - My heart so cold - Yes - Soon I will be gone
No hymns of praise - No words of grief - Alone in hell I'll die
No light to guide - No help in sight - I see no valkyries fly

Are the valkyries above us

The battlefields lies cold and dead - I hear no screams or sound
I see them move - I see them run - To fight another round
Is there still hope - I don't believe - Just sadness black within
A wasted life - A wasted fate - I hear no valkyries sing

Are there valkyries above us - Don't see their shadows fly

Comrades fall - Yet all is mute - We poor will count the cost
Valhalla waits just for the pure - No valkyries above us
The songs we sang - The lords we hailed - The words we thought were true
All meaningless - just utter lies - They led us to our doom

Many die and many bleed - The clouds bleed heaven dry
A vision comes - The last I see before my inner eye
A frozen stare - A manic grin - Unburied in the frost
The valkyries ride and leave me here to rot - Yes - I am lostSome call it trash
but I think it art, are

I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me

Freddie Mercury

When you hear a sound that you just can't place
Feel somethin' move that you just can't trace
When something sits on the end of your bed
Don't turn around when you hear me tread

I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you

Now I'm in your room and I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life and I'm in your head
Like the CIA or the FBI
You'll never get close never take me alive

I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you

Hah hah hah hello
Who goes there?
Hah hah hah OK
Who goes there?
Hah hah hah hello hello hello hello
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Now I'm on your track and I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back but don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught you can't shake me shake me dear

I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
Watch me
I'm the invisible man I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
Look at me look at me

Shake you shake you shake you dearHeathen souls in the epoch of oblivion
Vanguards and legions, an allegiance of evil and leather
we duel in the dark till death do us apart.Do not follow where others have led
Proceed into darkness, leaving your own trail instead
The quest for truth: digging deep to find the root
Of existence, knowing no boundaries
Progression limitless

Demonstrate: divinity through own actions
Emanate: rise above carnal distractions 
Vegetate: lay the groundwork for a new creation
Penetrate: the darkness and begin deviation

Perception mutates as ego obliterates
Begin seeing truth, fallacy degenerates
Dawn of evolution through the power of thought
Principles of transformation...

Let go of all self-induced negativity 
Making advancements through knowledge and creativity
Fear, doubt, and greed will bring you down
Dig deep within to find the treasure that must be found...

Principles of TransformationTears

in mourningBlack clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high!
And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
Will die together in the end

God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your neverending curse

To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high!
And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
Will die together in the end

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave the mortal world

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
Will die together in the endThe human carrion, - bastards of the Universe, 
The faceless swarm of putrid malformation, 
Begotten by perverted force, 
It's time to squash the biped vermin.

The crunch of bones will mute the screams of pain,
 And women's wailing will die on gore-encrusted lips,
 Rivers of blood will flood the mass of flesh, 
The human pulp in agony will writhe

Newborns' lips mutilated by the sword, 
Unborn embryos rotting in the wombs, 
Toothless hags are dying poisoned, 
And abyssal creatures swarm 
Over  the putrid corpses..


The wretched Earth will lapse in Chaos,
Remaining flash will molder into mucus.
The wrath of oceans will sweep the urban dust, 
The doom, the fate of all of us...(Instrumental)I was died in childbirth
Sorrow altered me 
I'm a beast,called Surbile
I suck  the child,nape of neck

Colovra almighty snake
From subterrean abyss
Colovra,Colovra,Colovra
Our almighty snake

Fell the immortal...Hate
Fell the immortal...Cult
Fell the immortal...Hate

Great than a seven heads dragon 
Cananea the devourer
Murderer of crusaders
Behold the blood plain

Shapes of a primordial force,
Knowledge is for us,
A power crawl in our isle,
Omnipresent entity,
Blessed are the Serpent
And his cult !(Instrumental)Black thunder and lightning
Hatred hailing from the skies
The moon has vanished
Eternal darkness the final demise

Hail!

Thunder through stone
Crushing the path
Darkest of demos come forth
??? for ages to follow

Demons' night

Eradication of life - the only way
To eradicate christ once and for all

Not a soul to flee the stake
Reaching the false heavenly halls

A fateful night
Jehovah dethroned
And his throne of lies
Laid to ashes in the universal domeAngels & demons
Angels you will die
Angels & demons
You can't win this chapter, brother
This is my only goal
On earth, you have called your celestials legions
To fight your nemesis
My darkness is so nice
For you dejected human
Angels & demons
Angels you will die
Angels & demons
Angels you will die
Disciple undisciplined
Give up your existence to me
In my red paradise
All your vices will be bless
The sun will never climb
On the blue wall
The moon will be hide
Until' the new cycle
Your angels leave the earth again
Without the living creatures
The new era is near, brother
And my claws will kill again

Intense cold, freezing our souls 
The blood of the enemy offered in the ritual
Worshipping the Gods by the victory granted
Our sword imbued in blood ...

Many brothers were lost in this journey
Battles fought in behalf of the legacy
Trust in gods the ancient power
Honor our brothers in the rites of death

Tales of bravery forever intoned 
Temples of Gods shining bright
Surrounded by mountains and caves 
Rises from the ashes of timeDusk is near
the queen of Elphame emerges
Through the winter fog
Her haunting chant summons me

Howls of the night
Comfort me
Under the dead skies of Alba 
Beyond the grand valley 

Deeper & deeper into the black infinity
It slowly devours me
Close your eyes
Behold my coming

Howls of the night
Comfort me
Under the dead skies of Alba 
Beyond the grand valley 

As my army floods the deep well
I hear the outcry of my victim 
I depart
My spear is covered in blood

Howls of the night
Comfort me
Under the dead skies of Alba 
Beyond the grand valleyWe've come together for our this night
To conjure forces of hell's might
We're getting high on noise and mayhem
Noise and mayhem!

Burning, Berlin is burning

Nuclear warheads start to fly
Now feel the gleam in Satan's eye
We're banging hard on trash and mayhem
Trash and mayhem!

Burning, Berlin is burning

The final battle's taken place
Now make way for the evil race
We're gonna die in filth and mayhem
Filth and mayhem!

Burning, Berlin is burning(Instrumental)Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!Abominable but gifted man
Smell of the city, disgusting realm
The name forgotten now
Lived in its age in the domain of scent

Amongst the sweat of bodies and putrefaction smell
The stench of sulfur rose from chimneys
The stench of rotting flesh from the wells
Beneath the gloss of blooming age, a whiff of loathly humans
An era when the scent was all the rage, a lack of morals

The air brings slightly a breath of her
A tender image of her body with red hair
Stroking her cheeks, feel the splendid smell
The edge of a knife flashes mighty in her cell

The name forgotten now
Lived in its age in the domain of scent

A power stronger than thousands of men, the air was heavy
A pleasure terror in his hands, and him standing steady
Whimpering human beasts, loud cries and moans
Beneath the gloss of moral age, it was infernal(Instrumental)Upon the waves, the ancient's graves, thru tempest, thirst and plague
Beneath the sky of the maters eye, so grey, we sail for Eire

Blind, embarking in purple twilight, westward through the night
A shore to be reached, a battle beseached inside

In darkness the fearful sat beside themselves without a pride
a greater power guided, challenged, guarded the thresholds of thier minds

Lost are we who bask in comfort away from pain and strife
To reconnect, electrified by tales told in the pale moonlight

And then an island came in sight, a weary crews heart filled with light
until a scent of death blew east
bones strewn the shore for a raven's feast.

Our ship was thrown into the rocks, impaling three on boney docks
perhaps our fate was to be late
a grave at sea, merciful would be

FIRE ~ reigning from the sky
WATER ~ endless brime
AIR ~ parching, hot and dry
for EARTH we search and pray to find

Scorn ~ hungry and bleeding and left for dead
Hopeless ~ could we trust our mind?
Desperation ~ forced to feed upon the dead
Surely Hell is On This Earth!!

Wandering without direction betwixt insanity and a drowned hope for life
My boney hands, they held my face
A truth to us came at night.

Staggering we reached the western shore
Dying we faced our every fear
Regret then was meaningless
Salvation! A three skinned boat appeared!

Now we flee the west, having passed our test
the horrors beconed, 'join us' forever would we rest.

But nay, to our land we shall return to pass the stories on,
for all to fear, but forever learn.The pagan people
A united time
The pagan sign
See the sign (time)

Deep woods
A forgotten time
Now follow your guide

The pagan people
A united time
The pagan sign
See the sign (time)(Instrumental)When the trees become black, the time comes
The red blaze appears in the sky
holding the clouds of hatred.
When the forest becomes black
The time of transformation comes!

Our souls evil and cruel, depraved they call:
Oh, how much I'd like to fight!
Oh, how much I'd to see the blood of my enemies
on my father's ground.

The vengeance will be done
We can't go away now.
Oh, my brother wolf is calling me
in the blackness of the forest.
Oh, the moon is crying,
his silver tears falling on my me
create the silver armour.

Father moon's shined blinded my enemies
When the trees become black,
I am ready to fight!Sore days of emptiness
There's no end to the winter
Twilight carries through
Despair reigns over your heart
You don't know where to start
Frustration eats deeps into you
Prospects of a better future are a cynical utopia
As if everything's been lost
Its just a question of time
You need to find inspiration
Look up and let it pass by
And don't forget that whenever you call me
I'm here for you my friend
There's so much ahead for both of us
There's so many beautiful girls out there
Waiting for you to make your wishes come true
Dont be a hick, turn that fucking tv off
Get out of your flea-bitten den
Change your shorts and let's go
We're gonna rock tonight
Oh, I almost forgot
Im broke, could you front me?From the abyss
I come to possess your mind
I'm here to hunt you down
Feel the fear

I condemn you to loneliness
To slowly choke in emptiness

Kneel before my feet - Feel the anger in me
Taste the iron - Beg for your life

Cursed to feel eternal pain
You will never be the same

My creator - My curse
Your death - Suffering!

See the ghosts from your past
Cursed to feel eternal pain

You ripped me apart
Taking my creator away

I will never be the same
You will always be in my mind

My creator - My curse
Your death - Suffering!My days are grey like dirty snow
The fire's burning in my soul
Why should I live, love dying in pain
My death is Reaper's gain

In solitude I can not tell
Just of my deepest sorrow
All time that's left is freezing me
I'm waiting for tomorrow

The fire in my mourning soul
Burns all my feelings to the ground
And all my hope has gone away
I simply will decay

Of war in mind I ran away
The chaos lies behind me
On desert plains where I can't see
The golden bright sun blinds me

No strength to help to break the spell
This curse that grinds me down
My mortal life runs out of me
I'm dying on my own

The fire in my mourning soul
Burns all my feelings to the ground
And all my hope has gone away
I simply will decay(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Hand in hand, with closed ranks
Knowing no mercy
The new warriorhood sows the fear
Gleaming with their blazing eyes
I already hear their heavy steps
I already feel the breath of death
I foretaste the bloody battles
The prophecies start to fulfill
The horror in the hearts of the enemy mud
There will be no escape from the avening sword
The scum would pay for all
And even the skies do tremble...
Death rattle of the bloody throats, the triumphal call
A somber song of the greater victory
The great war comer to its' end
And a sunrise of the new era is already soon to come...(Instrumental)Built from... blind faith
Passed down from self-induced fantasy
Turn a page to justify
Conjuring power, it opens wide on your seventh day
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger

Inside crystal mountain evil takes its form
Inside crystal mountain commandments are reborn

All the traps are set... to confine
All who get in the way... of the divine
In sight and in mind... of the hypocrite
A slave to the curse... forever confined

Shatter... the myth
Don't cut yourself on your words against
Dreams made of steel
Stronger than any faith that inflicts pain and fear
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger

Inside crystal mountain evil takes its form
Inside crystal mountain commandments are reborn(Instrumental)The image of an artist
Agony in the air...

The sigh in your ear,
Of somebody that you don't know
It's the most melancholic thing
That could happen [to] you

The music didn't alleviate my pain
Only your memory kept me alive

A poem, a thought, an idea
A captured feeling in a paper
It's the only thing that I have

Perhaps I won't feel
The rose of a strange skin
And the worst thing is
That the time never stops

The euphoria and the sadness
One after another, death
I'll close my eyes and
I allow to run the time...Fear,invaders
Trembles a new dawn
Old men are gathered
Praying... drinking blood

Crimson the nightmare
Sleeping with no bed 
Vultures of sadness
Flying... dreamers from another world...      

Beyond the Mountains
In a secret by the mist
To the ancient power
Congregation of dying breed

Black moon risen
Darkness turning red
Spirits of Ancients
Spoken in my head

Shadows are dancing
Burning fire ablaze
Dark men are marching
Invoking to the gods of early days 

Vision of mighty
Could the mourning far from here
We always die alone
Incantation of darkly sins...Woods are crying at the wind
Dark melodies
Spirits of unreal where I live
By the village on the shore
Pagan return
A majesty forlorn, ancient lore...

Falling rain from the sky
Mountains behind
A shelter by the hills, with a scream
No salvation from the past
Hate coming fast
No secret rivalry, mighty sins...

Desolation around this hills
Into the eyes of the night
Like (an) evil reign beyond this death
Inevitable as dark
Vast woods within the mighty creature
Lurking in a void
A war (that) regrets of nothingness
Bastard legend lost...

Moons are watching through the night
Silence inside
Before a nordic sea... agony
Hidden trees prepares a storm
Of naked ghosts
Spirits of unreal... come to me!!!Through static frames
They desperately beseech
A ghost of knowledge

When Aleph is equal to Omega
This raging enthropy becomes
The unison of my perceptions

Double aspect of creations
Schemes of existence
Mirrored through the abyss

Nothing is true
Calculating interferences
From multiple realities

Through glyphs and myths
I awake the centres of power
Lucid speculation
Subconscious omnipotence
Matter is crafted
By a firmament of colliding destinies

Every single feature recalled
By each god in the arena
But dusk and oblivion are
The reward for the blindDoom - cold - clean

Hard - slow - dark

Everlastig - straight

Mindless - destroyng

Flesh
Blood
Hope

Waiting - growing

Goddamn an eye for an eye

I call my hords...(Instrumental)I'm watching your grudging look
With a dead pan expression on my face
And inside Im laughing
With the voice of the Devil
You're just another hypocrite
In this herd of lesser people
Indulging in perfidy
You life flows too unruffled for you to be different
You had everything you wanted
You have no idea how some things work
You've never taken anything in your own hands
Without the help of your wealthy parents
Just your double talk for playful girlies
Who spread their legs for anyone
Don't even think you can win me over like that
Your woman just won't stop following me around
But all she can do is suck my dick
You and the bunch of faggots dressed to kill
All the crap you pay so much attention to
Makes no sense to me
All the bullshit that comes out of mouth
I can't stand
I see what's inside your heads
And I'll get rid of your malicious thoughts
In no time with the deadly sound of my guitar
The only thing you can hear from me
Is one loud low pitched
.I.Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's been slow down below,
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

Pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double barrel, 12 gauge,
Can't lock me in your cage

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's been slow down below,
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hellI'll love this world today
And I'll hate it tomorrow
There's nothing sacred to me
There's nothing to make me stoop
No one wiped my ass
And I don't turn the other cheek
I love daydreaming
But it's my policy
to make my dreams come true
No more if's
Zeros try to determine our fate
But their jaws will drop sooner or later
All this carousel of absurd lies
Is nothing but paddling in shit
And the next thing they know
I'm wallowing in cash
I hear it's never as bad as it can get
Right, status quo suits me fine
This is the very end
Of all the meaningless platitudes
just a required accessory anyway
Stay where you are my friend
Don't even want to know the reality
And stay true to your illusionBelow among the storm
Armies march
Into a new age
The pagan rises

The dark time has come
The bugle sound
In the hills and fields
Announcing the war

So many times
And unfinished tales
The blood prevails
In our time

Hear the songs in the wind
And the tales of the past
No god no religions
Freedom till the end

The armies group in flanks
In the field
Horses and men
Stand side by side

The piper plays the bugle
It is the sign
Men against men
The battle begins

The first attack
And many fall
The death awaits
Your time is short

Hear...
Hear...
The battle is triumphant
Fighting till the end

We fighting bravery during days
Brandishing the steel of our swords
We were the last ones to fall
In this glorious battle of the men

Dark clouds covered the sky
And a storm fall down in silence
The screams echoes in the wind
The battle of our time was lost foreverThe night when aurora shines
I am standing alone here
I've lost lots 'o' things
I have had sad days
Sorrow and pains
How much difficulty must I get over?
Now I am at loss

Valuable time goes by
And I could know the one thing
Now I can feel beating
I must survive
Even if I am alone here

I live my life for my friends and my sons
They live in my heart all the time
It has been inherited ceaselessly
And I must not let it come to the end

Valuable time goes by
And I could know the one thing
Now I can feel beating
I must survive
Even if I am alone here

I live my life for my friends and my sons
They live in my heart all the time
It has been inherited ceaselessly
And I must not let it come to the endFROZEN STONE OF OLDER TIMES

From immemorial times
Arises the frozen stone
Upon the frost we worship
Ancestral wisdom reborn

Lurking deep in the woods
Blaze in cold moon
Dusk of immortal legacy
Awakening the storm

Old gods all forgotten
Dark winds blow my soul
Land of ice and fire
Hills beneath my throne

Black wisdom is my conquer
I cry alive and cold
Rise through blood and darkness
Time stands still unborn

Lyrics by Mortem
Music by MortemInfect your soul with the breath of blasphemy
Deep carve your skin with the symbols of might
Kiss the Black death, lick her lips and pussy
Spill your black semen and scream the dark anthems
Spread the seeds of pagan hate, the seeds of pagan pride
Infect the hearts of  the weaks with the fear of unlight
Appeal the ancient demons, the great heathen black mighty gods. Offer your soul and become an immortal
Be an armed arm of the ancestral beliefs
Pray the gods of war, northern overlords
Under the banner of the chaostar
You'll be a dark angel and scream the dark anthems

Scream the dark anthems:

Under the moonlight is rising the lustthirst 
Under the moonlight are rising the primal instincts
Under the night sky are born the mammals
Under the night sky has started the releasing
Under the moonlight are walking the hordes
Under the moonlight are walking the beasts
Under the night sky is rising the spirit of the wolf
Under the night sky are rising the barbarian mobs

Submit your soul to the tunes of blasphemy
Blow on the embers of insurrection
Spit in the throat of your priestess of lust
Ablaze the queens of darkness and join their orgy

Enslave yourself to the whores of blasphemy
Feel the wet heat of their tongues
the burning teeth of the insane witches
Smell the scent of the lethal slits of the carnivorous angel
Take a lesson of climax between the thighs of a sapphic goddess. Let her kneel down,
snatch her by the neck
Let your sticky spittle flow along her naked back
Arouse your animal instincts and let your venom deep inside. 
Deny the artificial rules of the heretic mankind
Nourish yourself with the hot meat of your prey
Revel in it's blood of this one too weak to survive
Rise at dawn with the lusty taste of death
Awake inner black beast and scream the dark anthems(Instrumental)I am the evil one
The tempter, sinner man
Archfiend, Diabolus
Hail Leviathan

Omnipotence Lucifer
Asmodeus, my soul
Feeding off inhuman life
Blood of liquid gold

Evil one
Flesh and bone
Evil one
Set in stone

I, the Royal Prince of Hell
Command infernal names
Lightning fills my ancient bones
Chithulu rise in flames

Dominating centuries
Consume the everlasting
Raising ashes up from earth
I, Satan, head rising

Evil one
Flesh and bone
Evil one
Cast in stone

Kneel
I kneel to no man
Rejoice
I see through your cries

Believe
You know not the truth
Blasphemer
Jesus fucks you

Crucify the holy man
No sermons of a fool
Universe, infinity
Behold, evil rules

Ever pregnant mysteries
Ahmoon commands the birth
Howling incantations
I rise from blackened earth

Evil one
Flesh and bone
Evil one
Carved in stone
The evil one(Instrumental)(Instrumental)God, stupid redemption of a fallacy
You represent the ignorance and mediocrity of the human race.
Immaculate lie you base power in the intimidation and terror.

Deity of a miserable era.
Deity of a mediocre kingdom
Deity enthroned over a lie
God of all fools.

I challenge you god of the Jews
I will dishonour you before the look of all your sons.

Deity of a miserable era.
Deity of a mediocre kingdom
Deity enthroned over a lie
God of all fools.

I will be your hangman, I will be you biggest fear
I shall be your pain and the suffering and agony of your immortal soul.

I offer you forgiveness in change of your submission
I will give you power and dominion in change of your indignation
I will drink your blood and I will degrade your soul.

I am the one who will takes your throne and I will brake your false image.

I am the one, who hates jehova, my name means denigration your actions
I shall be the one who hates your existence
I am the extermination of your creation.

I am the one who will takes your throne and I will brake your false image.So many years ago betwen Mountains and Snow
We lived in the shadow of the Highest Tree
Beyond the great Forest, Mountains, and Lowlands
Hawks and Eagles cleaving the air

Old Trees are speaking me, tell me long histories
About the future and the past
I was unite with them amoung the Thousand Flames
I am the Water, I am the Sky...

I feed the Wolves with my meat
They drink all of my blood
It taste like Earth, it taste like Water
But just the Nature feed on my Soul!

Waiting on the Highest Tree in cold and freeze
I see the eyes of the Owl
I see evertyhing, I know evertyhing
I am the Forest and the Forest is me

Flying with the wings of Freedom
Feeling the power of Winds
I see the light on the end of the Path
The Path of the Eternal Decaysee our lands burned down in awe
ressemble our forefathers fears
rewrite the sins with liar's pride
victory or defeat

evade the path of truth onto Valhalla rewrite the sins with pride
we smite you and we cast you away with a pitiful grin

come down once more to end this truce
join the horde begging for war and their mercenaries

mercenaries by themselves with cold steel in their veins
hate is truced in their brutal eyes only malice will reign
a blithering filled the sky until this day
see our lands burned down in awe
we resemble our forefathers fears

come down once more to end this truce
join the horde begging for war
mercenaries with ice cold steel in their veins
death upon their brutal eyes

evade the path of truth onto death, Valhalla Reborn
we smite you, cast you away
with a pitiful grin
come down once more
to end this truce
join the horde begging for war
hate is strained in their brutal eyes

see our lands burned down ressemble our forefathers fears
rewrite the sins with liar's pride victory or defeat
the honour of rebellion evade the path of truth
we smite you, cast you away with a pitiful grinA mental scar
Reported mad
A mental scar
Brought to heel
And then become an icon of the herd mentality


I couldn't live your humble way
I couldn't breathe the pious air
Your waiting for a judgment day
It's an awful mind control affair


With one swift cut
Turned handicapped
A single cut 
turned handicapped
You're just another in a row
Surrender to the directive from above


I couldn't live your humble way
I couldn't breathe the pious air
Your waiting for a judgment day
It's an awful mind control affair

I couldn't live your humble way
I couldn't breathe the pious air
Your waiting for a judgment day
In a state of a poor mind control affairEternal winters, frost nights will freeze blood
And make human statues cold
The stars shine so clear in a formation which
Scares tells that death is near

Something malicious and vengeful is out there
It must be as the wise man told
Worse than any plague do this occurence waste
All life and the creation of the world

It must be our master's work
The christian rules are gone
Demonic powers of evil come
Spirits doomed by christ

All his hated for us to come
The destruction of the christian world
The stars forms a laughing face in space
He laughs his scornful laughter while he does what
He request and his desire says

A destruction of world and a new and different dawn
Demons glows in the sky
Burning angels are left to die
The key is turned for the seventh time

The door number triple six is opened
Hail O' Master Satan
O'mighty the throne is yours
A satanic age, darkness will reign this time

A neverending devildance
Angels choking on air filled of dark spells
They drop their harps and fall in eternity
It's all a cosmic mess, planets cross in
Wrong directions and crashing into each other

This creation has it's final nightmare
Hear the screams of unlimited deaths
As songs of agony
It sounds like the vultures eat the living creatures

Eternal echoes give sound through remains of worlds
When the worlds existed these screams infect the minds
And now they are one with the infection
Every life and soul take place among the stars
As mirrors they send reflections
Of one weakly life on earth

A world of echoes, dead and buried cities
From a time of shame
Gods disciples and their words are just ashes
Among ashes in the atmosphere
Forgotten and buried in a demonic fire
Never to be read again

Something malicious and vengeful it was
It happened as the wise men told
Worse than any plague did this occurance
Waste all life and end the creation of world

A new creation has begun
Darken clouds eclipses the sun
But however strong the world become
Must we watch out for the unknown
Such sides has been shown
But forgotten at the future dawn(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Empty hearts of dreaming
The last sacrifice was done
Out of suns I'm burning
Who will take our life and souls?
See your eyes already
They never were alive
Please hold me and will survive

Have you ever seen the throne of the moon?
...every hope which dies?
Our life will stray to doom
Only if you find the truth....

Can you take your soul and save your life?
Rising moon, I feel it's time for you again
He shines in the darkness where you'd die
You can call this, love will rise as the rising moon
I feel it's time for you again
He shines in the darkness where you'd die
In the emptiness of night

The Miracle of living
Waiting for the last day
Hunting all the dead things
Calling from their graves
Evil of all sinners
This could not be paid
That is what the devil still says

Have you ever seen the throne of the moon?
....every hope which dies?
Our life will stray to doom
Only if you find the truth...

Can you take your soul and save your life?
Rising moon, I feel it's time for you again
He shines in the darkness where you'd die
You can call this, love will rise as the rising moon
I feel it's time for you again
He shines in the darkness where you'd die
In the emptiness of night

Light - you've never seen my face
Light - you've never seen

Show up to your house with steel-toed boots,
Kick your ass right off the roof,
Then shove a coathanger in your cunt,

Should not have seen and survived

The brain creates ghosts, it designs and snake dreams
In the grey fog on the screen of our dreams

Pain appeared to us desert and rigid
White as far as the eye can see

Floating in the void it keeps itself on
The edge of despairing it grants us life

Between black of the sky
Around all was death

Under the flights of crows,
We lay in a world of death and maggots

In a spectral dawn of snow our sterile and stagnate time
Not to forget being myself a man

We nave seen leaving our nothing our women
Every evoked memory arise to us painfully clear

All around us speaks of decline and end
But in tomorrow there is one certainty

It s man who kills man, it s man who in justice
It s not a man who sleeps with a corpse

Between black of the sky
Around all was death
Under the flights of crows,
We lay in a world of death and maggots

The number of the crows was increased and all knew

Part of ours to exist has center the spirits
Of who approaches to usDay after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cause it's such a long way down

So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all...am I?

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane
As me

(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim)

Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all

Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

Through the villages so old 
You reach the land of no return 
Where the heart of evil burns 
The rivers run red 
From the blood of the dead 
Mand men have come to fight 
But ended up dead as night 
On this day it is your turn 
To battle the land of no return 
All your life you have prepared 
To conquer the land so feared 
When time comes to dawn 
You begin your journey so long 
To do what no man has ever done 
And conquer the land of the evil ones 
During day the sun burns black 
In the land where you can't turn back 
And prepare yourself for the fight to come 
To conquer the land of the black sunBlood-revenge with sword in hand
We fought so hard to guard our land
Christianity sank down in flames
Slaughtered by northern rage, killed by pain

Our legions bleeding in religion's fight
Supported by hope for Oden's might
In last minutes all were waiting for valkyrie's ride
But vikings only gonna die in honour and pride

With Oden on our side
We wipe out all Christian souls
red rivers of dirty blood dropped off our swords
fill their self-dug holes

To honour our gods
we raise up our swords
to fight the cross
we'll burn out the bible's words

With Oden on our side

By the light of the waning moon three sisters fly with the crow
upon wings born from esoteric spellcraft which few are to know
converging from different directions to weave a fate of woe
as cloud banks obscure all light from the world,
a witch's seed begins to soe

Of names unspeakable and strange
beguiling dreams with fear unknown
a whisper creeping like mist through the heart
of mortal dreams, her name you'll never know

This world of man's unrest, false gods they enthrone
as the forests, moon and earth gasp a vengeful moan

At the summit the cauldron stirred
Effigies of their leaders burned
a dark trinity turned to the sky
cursing all who walk the path of selfish human pride

As the dawn breaks through the clouds, a woman child i born
with a will of fire she walks the earth
a curse for a mortal's scorn

A destiny written of wood and blood

Now a young girl walks in the woods, and speaks to the ravens above
'I shall be the undoing of men'
She screamed aloud, and a clap of thunder unrolled
from that moment on was a destiny written of wood and blood

Her will was to know the land, and from its growth to master the magick
and pass into the nether forever!
mysteries held safe by the trees
as she passed into the nether forever!

Now she haunts the dreams of mortal men
her presence stabbing like a dagger of the blackest arts

Nevermore will the see her again
yet feel her caress as their last dying breath

A destiny written of wood and blood(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)For the beast living inside me
Impossible to see
Eternity's end seems to be hazy
Or even doesn't exist
No one orders her to creep
To make a sacrifice for
Deity of living dreams
Imaginations

Beast into my mind
Beast into my heart
Beast into my veins
Beast - the claimed

Oh there's always
Just one gorgeous guide
Do it (do it) he whispers
Call on the dark

Oh there's always
Just one hidden beast
Do it (do it) she whispers
Reject your fears
And step into the hell

Hard way, highway
Six feet under the ground
Many tried carefully to do
A quick backward step
Huh...
They could only try
'cause the helpful beast
Always hardly insists

She leads them slowly through the shady halls
Filled up with screams of the painful delight
Fear defies her deceptive charm
(losers) they're going down do die

She's the one to serve, to watch the fireplace
She cleans every path and step to make it easy way
Beast prepares unknown decoction
No one even tries to exclaim

Oh she makes it easy way
Grave digger's friend
Slide, slide she used to say
Just like the serpentNuclear war gods of warDeep in the forge of Olin 
The hand again recast 
to move mountains and oceans 
the power within.. 

Pass the hand... 
By the flames of Valin. 

In the dark forge of Olin 
The cursed hand of bronze reborn 
Malice and Pain unearthed 
One of the tragedies of this age 

When the hand is cast 
The king will have a name 
and those dreams of those towers 
the Nightfall and trees everlast.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)It tends to be extreme
This self destruction in me
It tends to be extreme
Bale of calamity within

Theater of delusion
With the rood of celestial intrusion

It tends to be extreme
Manifestation of Apop's kin
It tends to be extreme
Perdition brightest gleam

I'm lost in this mayhem and confusion
Strangling repulsive convulsionsBloodred sunset was the night
We met at the oceans shore
bloodred stiletto was the one
I stabbed into her heart and
what for, HUH ???

Bloodred sunset was the night
I killed that motherfucking whore
Bloodred jacket as her blood flew
and I wanted more and more

Bloodred sunset was the night
I raped that ugly fat whore
Bloodred precept is the way
I go and want it more and
more and more

Bloodred sunset was the night
I blew up my brain
Bloodred sunset was the night
my life went down into a drainThere is a sea in the soul of all men
Who dare to choose
The winds of their destiny
Those who sail, know they could never return
Back to the shores of their land
Follow the dream, soar with the tide
Glory and gold, shine through the magic rain
Free as the wind, will you be legend
or drown in the oceans of pain

There was a boy, born and raised in a cruel time
He lived in a town by the coast
All of his life, he daydreamed of fame and adventures
Far from the dust of his land
Follow the dream, soar on the tide
Glory and gold, shine like a magic rain
Free as the wind, will you be legend
or drown in the oceans of pain

That boy is a man, his eyes as grey as the cold wind
That carved all the scars in his heart
So many years, he struggled at sea
For his own life, slave to the wheel of despair
Nothing is real, nothing but pain
Floating adrift, tied to the bloodstained helm
Watching the flames, as they devour
Born of the oceans of painThere is a road and it leads to Valhalla
where only the chosen are allowed
There is a boy with a dream of Valhalla
a place in the land of the gods

But in the heart where the fire burns forever
Where life goes on for those who fell in battle
The gods are waiting the moment he falls in a fight
And he will rise when the sun goes down

Raised high his sword
As he cried out Valhalla
His dream had become reality
And tonight he will die
On the road to Valhalla
Chosen to feast with the gods

But in the heart where the fires burn forever
Where life goes on for the mighty and ........
The journey has finally come to an end for the boy
And he has reasons as the greatest of them allHordes of chaos have come
Angered, wielded steel blades with power
They're all sloodthirsty
Hate in their eyes
They're bringing your doom

Drums of war,
Screams, loud warsongs of power
Barrels of fire
Battering rain, storming the wall

The air raises its backles
The winds scream death, fire and metal
A bright figure raises
On battlements cracking fire and metal

Thus spoke the wizard

Light, columns of fire
Chains lightings of mystical power
Bruning the flesh
And talking death to all

Feared units
Doomed, running away from the lava
And rains of fire
From the wizard unleashed might

The air raises its backles
The winds scream death, fire and metal
A bright figure raises
On battlements cracking fire and metal

Thus spoke the wizardWhen (the) cold sky is falling down
Darker is my soul with the fall
Tremendous jail, let it come
Marked me, like you
With the sign of the dead

This is my call - Hail Lord Chaos!
Tears from the gods - Hail Lord Chaos!
Bringing a new dawn - Hail Lord Chaos!
Remorse arises - Hail Lord Chaos!

Master of war and revenge
Unholy priest blinds the cage
Freezing the hearts, eerie calm
You promised me a return with the flame

This is my call - Hail Lord Chaos!
Tears from the gods - Hail Lord Chaos!
Bringing a new dawn - Hail Lord Chaos!
Remorse arises - Hail Lord Chaos!

Through grey clouds fade away
On this night I can see...
The lord of the mad brings insanity

This nightmare falls with a prey
To a world of sin
You promised return like a flame
Eternally...

This is my call - Hail Lord Chaos!
Tears from the gods - Hail Lord Chaos!
Bringing a new dawn - Hail Lord Chaos!
Remorse arises - Hail Lord Chaos!A horrid dream still
sometimes haunts my mind
I'd like to forget
the torture of the night
I reach up, but it's no use, there's nothing more to say
Dawn's now upon me,
perhaps it's best this way
Mirrors everywhere: all I see...
Everyone in my dream, staring at me
I slouch in silence, gazing at the wall
What a strange feeling,
seeing myself fall
I know there's no more,
still the ligth's intense
I've got a feeling - this is the end
From my dream a voice
begins to moan...
Look around you now, you're alone!
The storm's already here,
the window's bolted fast
Closed now forever,
like every exit path
Sweating, fighting, I'm at war
Just mirrors and faces
can see through the walls
I hear a voice,
followed by lots of useless words
I hear a voice, help me please...Came, led by the stars
 Spirits of the damned draw me near
 Mayhemed winds showed me the way
 And now i stay here, born from the wolf

 Scream of pain sounds in Darkness
 I draw my claws in wall of fog
 I scrape, scream, blood covered my scars
 my fangs tear the gates to Abyss

 Impure spirits, you showed me the way
 And now my blood becomes the key
 I open this last gate
 The Gate to the Kingdom of Darkness

 Black wind of the dead
 Inflamed my eyes to red
 My brothers, wolves, servants of the night
 They came from the forest

 Burning eyes among the Darkness
 Jaws thirsty for the blood, raised to moon
 Hired, longing and fear
 This is the last night and the dawn will never come
 Curse me, my brothers
 Because I lead you to death
 Salvation for mayhemed souls
 Souls of sons of the night in wolves bodies

 We've been always and we'll be forever
 Tonight we'll die and the next night
 we will come from beyond the gates
 of Kingdom of Darkness

 Gods of Darkness, awoken by our sacrifice
 Beast of gloom, spirits of fear
 Triumph of unlife's Powers
 Banners of the dead smeared in blood!

 Black is the ultimate colour
 Darkness is the only end
 Evil is the right reaction
 Death is the only mercy...(Lyrics: Eugen "Sotiris" Melnikoff)

In the land without heroes
Man was born without face
In the desert of the mirrors
He had hide in empty space

Always tried to be unnoticed
Time was looking for the man
He must pay for his asylum
Time is taxman, man is man

Victim's found,
But tale is going
Hunters looking for the next
In the land without heroes
Man was born without face

But in same land through the centuries
Shall be born another man
He will have his face and glory
No one can not that he'll can[Refrain]
Fight with me, kill with me, by my side
Fight with me, kill with me, by my side
We... Kill... We... Thrill...
We... Kill... We... Thrill...
We give you pain until we gain
We give you pain until we gain

Fight with me and come to see all the mighty power
Kill with me and cap all enemy with blood
Give them pain until the end united we may fall
We will thrill your mind and let rotate your neck

It's never too loud for a Heavy Metal crowd
Bang your head and let rotate your neck

[Refrain]Look how free I am
I won't let them catch me
All your banal worries are strange to me
All your petty interests seem so shallow
I don't understand why you'd waste words on this
Don't you know
That Im free from the problems
That plague you
Thats why I can't understand them
I had a feeling we had a lot in common
Now I'm coming to realize
How distant we were
And I'm not surprised at all
I wanted to offer you a sightseeing flight
Show you how to relish freedom
And give you a piece of my mind
Now I'm coming to realize
That you are stark blind
And your narrow-mindedness
Fills you with contentment
But I don't feel sorry for you at allLife Goes By As Time Goes On
Never Knowing When It Stops

You Swing Your Moods To Far Extremes
Knocking Everyone Off Their Feet
Open Your Mind To All That's Around

Round And Round We Go
Does The Madness Stop Who Knows
Who Really Knows

Round And Round We Go
Does It Stop
Round And Round We Go
Where It Stops Knowbody Knows
The Madness Always Takes Me Down.Their eyes were as a flame
of fire and on their heads
were many crowns they had
names written that no man hath

Their voices were as a sound
of many waters down
and when I saw them I fell
at their feet dead

Lo thy Kings

My sun became as
sackcloth of hair and
the moon became as
blood of the deadBlackness, be with us.
My art alone can crush men's hearts.
With terror we'll break the siege.
We summon the power of the runes.

A conqueror, a witch, a rebellion, our death.

Darksome night and shining moon.
Hearken to the witch's rune.
East and South, West and North,
I call thee forth.

The witch, during the retreat,
Fell and broke her neck.The agonic voices
of spirits without destiny
emerge from darkness,
frozen winds travel through the trees
with the penetrating odour of death.
From dark fountains emanates
a mixture of sacred water and blood
covering the black earth.

Human heads are pilled up
betwixt the trees' roots
covered with the blood of the sacrifices.
Still the sinister chants can be heard,
praising the gods,
chants offering the blood and the life
of the sacrificed.

No one dares to penetrate the dark Nemeton
where the leafy oaks let no light to penetrate,
the dwelling of the gods honoured with blood.

No one dares to get close to the sinister stone altar
where rest the skulls of the sacrificed.
No one dares to enter in the pagan forest
haunted by wolves and ravens.

Guarded by Kernunnos, god of Life and Death,
Taranis, yours is the blood of the beheaded and the burned,
Esus, yours is the blood of the hanged in the great tree,
Teutates, yours is the blood of the drowned...First day we made axes of stones
 Weapon of wild ones, blood flesh and bones
 Second day we got swords of steel
 Growing so stronger learning to kill
 Third day we became archers
 Spitting with death, the cold blood butchers
 Fourth day we've found out a powder
 The mighty dust to amplify our power!

 We shall rise again! We shall
 Fifth day we've invented the tanks
 Machine guns and mustard gas
 Sixth day we've built aviation
 To rule in the air, to sow extermination
 Seventh day we've found out chain reaction
 The nuclear blast we love to destruction
 We dropped the bomb, we washed all away
 But next day there were stone axes again!

 We shall rise again! We shell
 Civilization! Look at me!
 Now!
 Civilization! Look at me!
 Civilization! I am free!The storm ends up
The last drop falls
I remember the pain
Of my thought...

My hair is wet with each
Drop of that farewell

Without remorse
That it's the last
And my void nobody can fill

When storm begins
I won't be here
You are waiting for me
I won't return

My last cry
My last tear
My last feeling
My last life

My last fucking life...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Cold that covers its stench
With hidden, rocky stone-edge
That euts the flesh.
Hiding firechambers
Dead thronehetors
Falling into an abyss of walley
Down to a land of eternal frost
He appeared from the fog
He got lost in the fog, soulkilling shadows
He bore his bloody sacks upon his back
Bore as it was a joy
A plunder, from what he fills the space.
Whatever he's called.
Doesn't care about it
A damned won't find
Battle against him
Hell is home
Where a sullen couldness dwells
A shadow initiated to be bearer
By a holy arm that created a world
Became like the empire
Of eternal sin.
From the twilight of sullen Hell
The shadow breaks up
Takes sacks wet of blood
In his serving furyFuneral held for the depression of man
 Holds the key to his own death
 Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
 Tighten the tourniquet around your neck

 Sifting away the debris of hated life
 Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
 Seeking life beyond your perishment
 Repeating words echoing through your mind

 Chanting lines of blind witchery
 To save yourself from extinction
 Wanting to die is your reason to live
 New life born from the oppressed

 Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
 Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
 Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
 Fatality, reality, you await the final call

 My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
 Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
 Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
 Come and die with me forever
 Share insanity

 Do you want to die!

 The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
 Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
 Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
 What I am, what I want, I'm only after deathUdazken laino bat bezala joan zinen,
Uste nuen ez ninduzula harrapatuko inoiz
Goibel nago ta ez dakit alboan bazaude
Mila soinuetan apurtzen naiz, euria bezain arin
Oroitzapen guztiak ezerezean galduko dira orain
Berdin da, etorkizun eta iragan, itzuliko dira
Ta ni ekaitzaren begitik begira

Bizipenen ur jausiak itotzen gaituzten
Ordu ilun hontan,
Zure besarkada batez eginda legoke,
Lore bat bezala, ximeltzen..

Ni izango naiz, bai ni izago naiz,
Itxuarentzat paisaia,
Txori askearen hegoentzat zeru zabala.
Basoan, bi aihen belar bezala bezarkatuko gara
Zure malko goxoak biziaren aintzirara ixuri artean

Beldurraren malkoak haizeak darama
Argiaren dizdira da erakartzen nauena,
Joango naiz, joango naiz, ez...

Hilkorren seme-alabak biluzik
Orain nire aurrean,
Biziaren iturrian denok ur berberaOnce a man
Now bound by power
Mightiest of the nine
Fallen into darkness
The Morgul Lord leads the great battle

For hope of Men
Shall fail in his hour of death
Who become one and falls in death
Will be lost

High above Pelennor Fields
They fly striking fear in all
One with death
No man can kill
Wraiths of Sauron
Bound by the Ring

No man can kill
Minas Morgul will rise
No man can kill
The hour of the Witch King shall arise

The hour of the Witch King is near
The voice, wich welcome all Men's fears
The Morgul Lord leads on(Instrumental)To fall asleep far from these lands
In wills of the water
A rough ship as shepherd in the fog
Guided by inner voices
Of the spirits keeping me alive
A point between several lives
A break on a aimless road
Oars in my hands defying
Sleeping gardens mud
In wills of the stars
Along the banks with
Lunatic herbs
A cloud of indian ink
Switching off the light
Drop by drop
In a sensual dance
With the dizzy shadows
Guided by inner voices
Of the spirits keeping me alive
A point between several lives
A break on a aimless roadWith anger and hatred torn has soul 
On shape of night skies riping with lightning 
With darkness and lust wrapped up my mind 
So as a flame embraced with darkness 
With sorrow and sadness full my heart 
As if a horn for banks full of bitterness 
With hoar-frost and ice forged my thoughts 
Of unbridled fury of winterfrost 

Over my head heavy grey clouds 
Under my legs only ice and snow 
Wild ice - waste forged with frost 
Where govern and ruler frosty strong wind 
Gods drive me with path of destination
through this raw land of mighty frost
Lonely I wade through ice and snow 
Slowly oneself with ice becoming 

As if a night sky torn lightning 
Soul has with torn anger and hatred 
So as a black wraps up grandeur of bright flame 
My mind wraps up lust and darkness 
like a horn for banks full of bitterness 
My heart fills sadness and sorrow 
Of unbridled fury of winterfrost 
With hoar-frost and ice forged my thoughtOutro Obiata-Sacriface for Gods


For the fortune of destroyed irons of humiliation
For this, that we dont live anymore in eternal shame
For this, that poison has stopped strangle our throats
For this, that cross of weak christ doesnt burn and doesnt prosecute
For this, that biblical sin is ordinary absurd
Im raising horn with drink and my right hand to Sun
Im crushing sacriface provender 
Im swearing an oath 
Hearing The voice of Gods, the voice of ancestors
Drum and horn are making sound
Miraculous tone from divine Niwa living matter
Im healthy,full of Faith Wened man
With burning heart I will spread fire of Slavonic faith
So on my tired motherland Lechia could rise and revived!
And her folk could wake up from a nightmare
Let thunder will hit me if I will abandon my task
I swear to You my Gods and Forefathers!(Instrumental)Rot a choice to be born in burning fields of moving freedom
Cure the disease by blood that feeds the ground
I turn symbolic icons into pieces, ruins of thoughts
I do not fear for your souls errant
I face to what engender choice imposed to us
I don't want on my grave tears empty of sadness
We get what we deserve
Tears empty of sadness
Enemy of reflexion, power-hungry society
Watching our children growing up with illusions
For the days I wish you
I dream that all financial systems collapse
That any economy may sink
For we resume control of our consciousness
I turn symbolic icons into pieces, ruins of thoughts
I do not fear for your souls errant
I face to what engender choice imposed to us
I don't want on my grave tears empty of sadness
We get what we deserve
Tears empty of sadness
The "heart" is too romantic notion for everyday use
For a game of chess where each piece has its own will
Every day I keep the hope to see the world disappear
My words will be charged(Instrumental)Death, screaming without a sound
Wizards of madness, commanding beasts
May madness hunt you down
Raging through the dusty air

Fallen far behind, these symbols of God
Empty landscapes to fill with passion of the temptator
Apocalyptic dreams, awaking the depths
Suffocated dreamers, enlightening the portal

Through me, enriching the mind
The winds carving souls, eternal breaths of nothing
Through me, enriching the mind
The path, bright before you I stand

Through me, enriching the mind
Only I search out the key for the one to enter
The path, searching for the codes, may madness hunt you down
The path, bright before you I stand

Death, screaming without a sound
Wizards of madness, commanding beasts
May madness hunt you down
Raging through the dusty air

Through me, enriching the mind
The winds carving souls, eternal breaths of nothing
Through me, enriching the mind
The path, bright before you I standGaze into the eyes of possession
A rancid emotion burning in darkness
Evil's monstrosity releasing its sickness
Decomposed are the corpses, their minds burn as one
Skies turn black with evil, reek of the dead
Shadows upon the tomb, they bleed their pain
From the grave they rise souls of the damned
Screaming from beyond
Souls of the damned
Unleashed from the depths of hell
The souls of the dead evolve
Their pain ignites the cross
Burn the christ to the ground
Raped by the wretchedness
The agony of knowing that they've lost
Their lives, their bodies rotting
One night they'll rise again
Out of the grave craving human life
Stare into the grisly eyes of death
By the dead, you're hypnotized
Tranced by the dead, they watch you eat your flesh
Feasting on gore, they dance with organic pleasures
Their ritals done, now you end your life
Until then they're in the ground
The rotted corpses hell has found
Maggots infest the decaying skin
Waiting to unleash the beast within
The souls are screaming from beyond
For their flesh and blood are gone
Waiting for their night to rise
The souls of the damned will never die.Die
Die...
D.I.E. ?..The Sun appears in the horizon,
the raven bless us from the sacred oaks,
Lug is with us, in a day as today.
With the first rays of light
our axes and swords shine.
Soon we will start to sing old battle chants
that appeal to Honour and Death on battle
and the luras howled as if they came from the Underworld
while the spirit of the sacred animals possessed us.

We fought as brave warriors
that's why we received our reward,
because we fought for our things, for our land,
that's why Teutates has revived us
sinking us in the renewing cauldron.

Now is me who encourage you to march prideful,
fight with no care about death
because we felt that mourning
but we have returned
to keep honouring our kind,
to keep the pagan pride...
Heathen Iberia!!!!!Lord, take me as your weapon to do all evil
I will bring hatred where love was meant to be
Let injustice be spoken over forgiveness
Bring dissension where agreement used to be

So doubt in those who believe
And fear their hypocrisy

Darkness will conquer the light
Let happiness be overshadowed by pain and sorrow

I will let delusion rule instead of truth
Oh master,
Let me seek and find
The ultimate chaosI hear a voice of wisdom called as soft as thunder in the storm.
Bringing the glory tales of those who went before.
Where once ravens flew.

Where honour rode in the faith of the true a Hammerheart would know not fear.
With banners shining high and swords, which were drawn to defend.
Where once ravens flew.

But now this land, this land once pure and wide and free,
this land is cursed; faith lost by those who could not see.
But still the ancients call, awake the hearts of all who would believe.
A voice of wisdom calling us to war. Now rise up, fight, be free.

O one-eyed god on your throne in the sky, I feel thy wolves and ravens near.
I hear thy son ride upon the storm, the hammer shining as our guide.

Arise the sons of northern thrones, Allfather's calling us to war.
Fight for our home, this land which once was our.
Where once ravens flew.

And again ravens fly. Soar into the havens on wings of blackest night,
screaming the glories of ancients past they rise from the slumber of ages.
Wisdom. Thought. Memory. The call to remember, to reawaken this ancient heart
so lost in the passage of time. Ride once more. Ride upon the north wind, caressing
the gentle breeze that rages within the storm. Spread wide to catch the wind,
to catch the storm. See how they fly once more held high in the faith of the true.
And the swords, the swords, raised up again into the vast and blue wide hall of ancient dreams,
glinting in the sunlight. See how they shine. See how they glisten. An ocean of shimmering
silver steel bathed in the morning light of reborn glory. A Glamour of metal
and voices raised high in the hails of our forefathers, the ancient hails to the gods of the north
wind awaken, and we, the sons of the north wind, the sons born to these northern thrones,
we hail thee. Odin, Odin, Odin, Allfather we hail thee. Ride at our side once more.
Reach out with the great and lofty Gar-spear to guide your chosen sons to reclaim our rightful thrones.
Ancient thrones. Thrones secured by the blood of all our fathers who now dine in glory at thy side.
Thy ravens above us, so beautiful they stand in pride. Honour, glory, victory. This victory ours, Sigtyr.
Til death, til glory, til victory, til Valhallr greets us with gates so wide and open,
welcoming thy sons to our homes in the sky. Ravens above us, held high in faith that we never fall.
And the Hammerheart, the heart that beats so strong and true and constant, never to cease,
never forgotten, for we never die that glory gain but to rise once more in splendour beyond the reason
of mortal sight, to reclaim these lands once ours' to restore the heart of ages.(Instrumental)The Jewish oppression shall once more lie in ashes 
Burned by the flames of our everburning hate 
Tearing apart the creations of our father must end 
Tolerating it is a suicide for our sacred nation 

Marching towards the dawning of the new empire 
With our fists raised in anger 
Marching towards the rise of the sign of the sun 
Shadowed by the wings of the eagle of steel 

Burn their temples and piss on their sixpointed star 
Tear their books full of lies and persecute their children 
The wealth and pride were achieved by our blood 
Their greed and lies must be stopped from usurping themThe ode of mental binds hold pagan truth
Together we soar with the ravens
Embrace darkness under the stars
Falling evil from peering eyes
And under this dark and dismal light
We built immortal memories
Of sable dreams and ancient skies
Resonating seeds in unique harmony

The flames of the pagan sun, unite us!
The hoarfrost melts, unify in lust! (x4)

Gaze into the soul of the storm
In relation to catastrophic wind
Cascading thru crystalline rivers
Whirlpools in a void of turbulence...

Drawing intricate ancestral weaves
In lunar moons casting shadows
Embracing solemn shades of light
A divine invocation!

Ancient secrets to be revealed
Discovered through dissonance
Hidden scripts of balanced time
Connected souls of ageless silence...

Purified by the gods eternal fate
Valkyries in flowing luminescence
Gazing at the stars in the universe
Spawning immortal entities
As we journey to our dark heaven
Hidden virgin land paths unexplored
Keep this enchanted soul ablaze
An epitaph driven to the zenith(Instrumental)Shades of olden boughs cast against dying embers of sunset
Danced fervently as evening winds arose once more
'Ere weary gusts began ebbing to a gentle breeze
And twilight succumbed to the persistence of devouring night

Flittering leaves whisper wisdoms of forgotten eternities
Dark secrets laid upon the crests of fragrant air
Vapours creeping slowly through the rows of oaken limbs
Wove silken cloaks above the feet of elder mountainsBad blood spills
Within this angry heart
Where time stood still
Right from the start
Frozen in a replay
Of old wounds that bleed today
When hindsight's fish-eyed demons
Feed like birds of prey
Anger is an engine
Running on the fuel of memory
And when memory grows hazy
The harpies sing to me
Lost in their song
I see no right or wrong
And the cancer inside me
Grows strong
Fed on bad blood
It darkens all I see
Bad blood,drowning me
Hatred has swallowed me
Eaten,I ripple away
Like a teardrop in the sea
Eleventh hour
Without remose I'd sell
My soul for the power
To break your spell
And make you pay for all
The dread & fear that you hurled
The fear to bring a young child
To your poisoned world
Anger is an engine
Running on the fuel of memory
Making me crazy
I boil at four degrees
I sleepwalk along
Lured by the harpy's song
Drawn out to join in the throng
Drunk on bad blood
It blurs reality
Bad blood,has sentenced me 
To doubt everything I see
Jonah in a whale of deceit
Just a pawn of irony
Turn the page,leave me be
Understand you're not welcome
A plague at my door
Locked my cage,lost the key
If knock I will
Swallow the anger no more
I am not the one I was before
The gambit fails
I think it's time to paint
Your flash with knives
And rusty nails
To crown you martyred saint
Of wasted lives(Instrumental)You have cometh from a PIAST clan
With an iron fist you injure foes
Like a wolf cub with Gods fate
You released yourself from Christian slavedom
For your blood is unstained above the Slavic race
Tough, sanguinary, all as one
You stand proudly against enemies
A brave warrior......praise the SLAV!!!
He lets no one take part of his father land!
Above them he will proudly stand
Such is the noble PIAST blood
Ever vigorous, never spat upon
Always honour above all
To fall in battle under axe's mighty blowBe aware of the flame
Of a thousand years old stake
Its dust covers your eyes by the wind
And draws filthy tears.

Frozen into vengeance's fire
The ashes of our pure soul
Stars your evilness
Against your evilness

Whatever be
The seed of our wrath
Old foliage grows
From it by rain.

Pillar of the old foliage
Black tree of our faith
The flame of our eternal fire
Breathes from its mouldy branch

Eternal fire of will
Crystal drop of clearness
Burn up the master
Of mostile thought

Be aware of the flame
Of our thousand years old stake!
It's dust covers your grave by the wind
Drawning filthy tears(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Bow, arrow, narrow spear,
Sword and shield, have no fear,
Into battle kill with rage,
they won't see another day.

We are vikings, we are strong,
we, the vikings, kill your sons.
"Guide us Oden!", we all pray,
blood is flowing on our blades.

Sailing in our longships,
sailing over raging seas,
landing in the morning,
your peaceful village
is the battlefield.

Bow, arrow, narrow spear,
Sword and shield, have no fear,
"Guide us Oden!", we all pray,
blood is flowing on our blades.What would you tell to the darkness?
What fills up your eyes with pain?

Which words do you whisper to the dark?
In bitter waking hours, when the walls hold you tight

There isn't nothing here for you, only death
The ships sail

How do you feel with blood on your hands
When hate obscures minds
How do you feel while looking at the fiver flow
How do you feel when you cant stop it
When cries don't stop madness
When all goes on in any case
When blood covers the earth
How do you you feel now that it s all over

There are wounds time cannot heal,
So deep that pain follows you like a shadow
Sometimes we wait for something, sometimes we chase,
But really we do not know what

When one cover is not enough (to heat us)
When it all remembers, when
When you have only your hands to dig,
When you don't have more tears to cry
When you look around and you see darkness,
When the dawn is as dark as the night
When one life is not enough
To fill the emptiness within,

Whispers to the wind but nothing else, dust and nothing else
Sometimes light disappears and cold wraps me up,
Too much efforts to light up it on again and what do i see?

I cant see anything, not even other lights,
Only dazzling flashes that shake my soul

They say this is life
They say you must go on
When pain subdues you and
Your legs can t bear your weight
If memories are clashing us,
I would like to understand,
How can you keep going
With the pain inside(Instrumental)Now! He hangs around
 I know here comes the hound
 With the fangs besprent of
 Poison! He's breaking bounds
 In the name of the mounds
 And the end is getting
 Closer! Rushing through woods
 Breaking trees, tearing roots
 Desecrating our
 Temples! He is the dog
 Howling out in the fog
 And I know he's just a
 Dog with scimitar!
 Poisonodog!
 Why should we all die?!
 Poisonodog!
 Why should you live?!
 Ground! Crumbling away
 Because this is the day
 Of the came the coming
 Over! Just feel the pain
 And the beast is unchained
 While the world is growing
 Older! Forest is dead
 And the fields boiling red
 And the rivers getting
 Frosen! Time is up now
 And you can't stop hound
 And I know he's steelclad
 Dog with skimitar!
 Poisonodog!
 Why should we all die?!
 Poisonodog!
 Why should you live?!Piercing flesh with a sound of twinge
cries of death was sung and so begins the washing of body
wash away the earthly filth so that the departed 
may be as while as a swan
dressed in white clothes and carried home
dignity your speeches and cries
for those who are dead still hear them

may wailer cry for the dead
wake
a great feast combined tales of life
singing and prayers for the dead before the great journey
cry for the dead wailer but no disturbance of peace at night

take greetings to the underworld
tell your stories of life...A place where the elements conjure 
And the hills rest behind the waters edge
Loud and full of life by day
Calm and peaceful by nightfall

There are no human errors her
For that is now long forgotten
There is no greed to keep us
There is no need for comfort and endorsement

It's the path this pathetic race may never take
Many are too drowned by their comfort
With their steady pay the no longer need to think
And with technology motivation is not even needed

Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies

Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years

Oh my child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means

We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love(Instrumental)Lyric by A. Lordgrimm

Welcome legions of reverence
Follow me to fight against the christian fools
Rage runs in our veins

They will feel the fury of the strong ones
And we won't give them our mercy
Their icons we'll destroy with pleasure and wish
And the temples of illusions and lies
Will amazingly burn

Cruelty inherited from the past
Victory overcoming with hatred and pride

A dark new age has coming
And the old pagan spirit shall reign again
Awaken from a very long time
To eternally prevail

Let the fools perish...
Let the fools perish with their own punishment
They will burn into their own hell
The hell they created

Come warriors...
Come with me to reign our pagan realms
We'll recover what was robbed us
To honor our ancestorsVokol noci, prapor snov,

Dont try to hide you will blind your eyes
So prepare to die

[Chorus]
Sunshine burns, burns(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I don't regret anything the bridges of life,
Feeling the earth's cold on my face. I come to you,
Oh, wonderful death!

Rending the sight,
Hiding the thought
I don't feel her anymore, because life is too wreak...
I didn't expect it!
I  feel as the storm is coming
The holy war is near
Total chaos.
Living in the dream, where everything is possible
I prepare the arym of nothingness
We can't wait so long.
We will raise our pride heads
And we will strike suddenly!

We will jump to your throats
We will enslave your children
We will humiliate your woman.

The storm is coming there is no time
Feeling the smell of combustion
You open the doors to unholy life

Forever, for millions of sacrifices
You'll rot from inside
Forever. I'll remember it,
because you will screamin delightful pain
... Forever!It was a night of silence.
The crescent shone in the darkest night.
Rain wets the earth.
I've seen the hell.

The earth was dyed to the color of blood.
That world was tragic
that was not able to thought.

A lot of people were killed.
I heard the voice of their sadness.
I should regain peace.
I am sacrificed with pleasure.
I cast the spell of the revival.

I spent the days of grief.
However, it ends today.
It is my independent day today.

I spent the days of grief.
However, it ends today.
Oh this is the victorious holy war.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Shades enfold the azure dawn
alliteration unveils her talons
howling vulture winds
unleashed

Hearken the wail of skies

Crepes carved by stars
retreat before the upheaval
skies weep ivory despair
auburn leaves like wounds
defy the waking season
dale soon to be wreathed
with garland of frost

Enthralled I stare
as domes of thunder near
can you feel a fiery stung
thirst for embers of soul
asylum in ruins
iced stakes through calm

Zephyrs preach of mortality
fragmented and frail
scarlet frozen ponds
reflect naked vines
tusks of tender chill
swallow the warmth within(Instrumental)Through oblivion I have been travelling for hundreds of years 
Hidden from your sight 
Passing your fates. 
Born by the night dark 
Into the deeps of blinding darkness 
I penetrate everything. 
I was a pool hidden in a thicket, 
A spring breeze and a winter windstorm, too. 
I guard worlds spun of dreams 
Beyond levels of double truths 
Under the signs of ogam. 
It is me who rides on the saddled time.Skullz will crack brains explode
The force of evil set to unload
Dawn of death these days are coming to a bloody end

Violence on violence

Demons soar through the night
To attack the enemy on site
Hells command torture given to the souls of the damned damned damned

Violence on violence
Give me some violence

Eyes of black heart of stone
Sitting high upon the highest throne
The return of domination will be soon, now!

Violence on violenceI was ready to end it
but I thought that I owed something
I tried not to hurt anybody
but it was impossible for this world

But the time has come
To crush their heads
and play with their minds
because I have no patience left

Greedy and infernal men
Filthy minds messing with souls
Forever liars infect my air
A incest miasma is burning my eyes

Let me tell you what
Your time is over now
The fire was sowed by your hands
will burn yourselves too

Greedy and infernal men
Filthy minds messing with souls
Forever liars infect my air
A incest miasma is burning my eyesThe black sky. Engulfing all that is known. Shadows spread over the earth. An icy frost slides across the land. The stars look upon us in contempt. The time has come for redemption. All the fallen heroes. All the dead souls arise once again. The hour is upon us. The battle is to begin. Armies of the dead, clothed in broken, shattered armor. Line up along the battleground. The common man looks upon them in horror. And with the raising of his mighty spear. The war begins. Behold the end of mankind.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)As the hills remind with highness
How hard is so find the brightness
To forget her light
Never let to fight
In the tomb resides the human madness
Sympathy to deny the roots
A blind grey heart headlining troops
Reading wrong, the ancient word
The horizon far, her spirit tongue

Mother the strength deserves new landscapes
No longer forgot
No longer ashamed
Reign again...

Glorious while heaven falls we stand so proud
No longer alone
No longer afraid
Dance again...

A false heart beating
The Mother Nature's tomb
The child's wound screaming
The Mother Nature's tomb.

Then swell the hand
Don't dwell the ground
Walk and fight for the true

Reasons come, the elder word
Today the blood don't flows
Creating rounds, victorious howls
Again the Mother Nature's come(Instrumental)As the sun is hiding by the autumn clouds 
 The rain approaches, the rain is coming from the north. 
 As the air is getting colder. 
 The voices from the past, sound louder 

 I wanna write about the pale sun 
 before i will sence that i'm done. 
 The mist is covering, all over our fen. 
 The right time to pick up my pen. 

 Now the rain is falling, on the dead leaves 
 looks like bodies, robbed by thieves. 
 On the wet soil i layed, in full delight. 
 Nature's thousand faces are my treasure. 

 I wanna write about the pale sun 
 before i will sence that i'm done. 
 The mist is covering all over our fen. 
 The right time to pick up my pen.Demons from the darkest deep 
Sent by the dark shadow 
In order to destroy 
The light of the weak 
A dark hole is opened 
In the cold winterland 
Opened by the dark believers 
Unholy forces in the blackened dark 
They will see the heart of Christ 
Ripped out and sent through the hole 
The hole of darkness and sorrow 
From the darkest deep 
Comes the confined souls 
Whit their Ice-bound hearts 
The weak son of mother Mary 
The feeble belief of a god 
The son of the holy whore 
Fall down in inhuman pain 
God... in spiritual death 
Weakness... in the holy horde 
When they who believe in him 
Laying on the ground to rot(Instrumental)Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; 
 and I look downward because exalted I am. 

 I love those who do not know how to live, except by going under, for they are those who cross over. 
 I love him who lives to know, and who wants to know so that the overman may live some day. And thus he wants to go under. 
 I love him who loves his virtue, for virtue is the will to go under and an arrow of longing. 
 I love him who casts golden words before his deeds and always does even more than he promises: for he wants to go under. 

 Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; 
 and I look downward because exalted I am. 

 I love him who justifies future and redeems past generations: for he wants to perish of the present. 
 I love him whose soul is deep, even in being wounded, and who can perish of a small experience: thus he goes gladly over the bridge. 
 I love him who has a free spirit and a free heart: thus his head is only the entrails of his heart, but his heart drives him to go under. 
 I love all those who are as heavy drops, falling one by one out of the dark cloud that hangs over men: they herald the advent of lightning, and, as heralds, they perish. 

 Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; 
 and I look downward because exalted I am. 

 Behold, I am a herald of the lightning 
 and a heavy drop from the cloud; 
 but this lightning is called overman.White moon rise, rise again
Flag of the enemy burning
Standing pure, bright and proud
In the Aryan moonlight shroud

Racial and cultural cleansing
For the European child's duty learning

My choice is to stand and resist
With iron fists smashing crosses
Avenging those brave warriors who died
Under Mjolnir's sign... we shall fight!!!

Filth from fatherland must be extinct!
Through battlefields, the eternal blood shall win

Keep your Aryan moon pure and white
Preserve your bloodline and lineage pride
Secure the northern identity from the crowning disease
Blood for blood piece by piece...

For each European, for our Culture, for our Nation!!!I await the twilight, the end of the diurnal sphere.
The light behind the shadows of the night.
He closes his eye, and behold the world.
On his throne of frost.
Thy Gift, His ravens awakes and fly high to reach the chorus of the Elders...
as divine voices of the unlight... as the cry of the dark skies.
Cursed Christianity will pay!
Demonized by the foreign God in the body of the Ojancanu.
Condemned to wander through our forests, 
through centuries... WRATH!
I see the moonlight... I feel the mist of nocturnal freeze
Dreams and nightmares became the same.
Why this embodiment of falseness?
Never forgive the enemies of our beliefs.

Too much hate to forget their lies.
Too much concentrate anger for their God.
Rise high the banners, with pride!
In memory of our ancestors.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Voices of our ancestors become heard in the rustle of the wind
Gates between worlds stay open tonight
The time of death and rebirth of life
Now we can sweep into to gully and fall down through the mythical pass
wood and animal deity
A part of the union, like a stone in an olden wheel
Traces of times long gone ...
a promise of everything they can bring

We shall fare forth on a solemn journey of return
together we shall sail on the marvellous night
under the brightest shine of the moon and the stars.
At the time of dying and rebirth of life

A part of the union, like a stone in an ancient circle
Traces of times long gone ...
a promise of everything they can bring

The song of the past will fly with the wind and over the clouds
It will sound in the valleys, on the hillsides and in wild waters.
All the riches of my dear land will remain untouched.
There, in the highlands of our unique homeland.

Now we can sweep into to revine and fall down through the mystical pass
We shall fare forth on a solemn journey of return
At time of dying and rebirth of life(Instrumental)Look at the horizon filled with nothing
Look the tears that are going to dissolve
With the glacial wind brought by forsaken souls

You can't find the peace easily as you believed
You can't smile without a good reason
This path just leads you to a false hope

You are fighting and crying
Bleeding and running
You almost can't breathe
Desperate soul, what do you want to do?
Salvation reach you when
You'll stop to crucify yourself

Look at yourself now, jaded by your illusions
You curse and you swear, but it's useless
You'll continue to suffer in the lake of your tears

Look at that abyss of fire

You are fighting and crying
Bleeding and running
You almost can't breathe
Desperate soul, what do you want to do?
Salvation reach you when
You'll stop to crucify yourself

For faults you don't have

You are fighting and crying
Bleeding and running
You almost can't breathe
Desperate soul, what do you want to do?
Look at that abyss of fireDo you believe in God?
The God of the cross... The God of the church?
Do you believe in God?
The father of Christ... Creator of all?

The God that tells you what to do and do not
The one who writes your fate before you were born
The same God that if you don't follow its will
Condemns you to suffer all eternity
To burn in a lake of fire and sulphur
Cursing your in a spiritual slaughter

But He loves you!!!

Do you believe in God?
The God of the cross... The God of the church?
Do you believe in God?
The father of Christ... Creator of all?

The God that condemned and drowned the world
The one who forgives pedophiles priests and nuns
Taking other faiths to extermination
The same motherfucker who speaks about love
But keeps the whole world in an endless Holy War

Do you believe in God?!Hell, evil, Satan's curse 
From the sky it falls 
Metal burns my fucking brain 
Satan took the fall 
Deceased men from hell and hatred 
Pollution to mankind 
Antichrist my son from hell 
I will make you mine 

You'll die there's no time to run from hell 
You lied the witch has cast her spell 
Your sins will be paid for and sacrificed 
This is the price - Satan's curse 

Sin, hate, eternal death 
Decayed my flesh I rot 
Running below Satan's home 
Lord of Hell he's not 
Lust for evil, son of Hell 
Beneath the smoke I rise 
Flames torch my body 
A sinner's solar eyes 

Sacrifice your soul will be doomed 
Your evil friends who have deceived you 
Satan's curse enters your soul 
Beneath you'll burn - Satan's curse 

Sky fades to black 
As the heavens diminish 
Evil takes over 
The world is finished 

Hell, evil, Satan's curse 
From the sky it falls 
Metal burns my fucking brain 
Satan took the fall 
Deceased men from hell and hatred 
Pollution to mankind 
Antichrist my son from hell 
I will make you mine 

You'll die there's no time to run from hell 
You lied the witch has cast her spell 
Your sins will be paid for and sacrificed 
This is the price - Satan's curse(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Down in the valleys, down among the rocks
Standing there with my warriors
For home and heart

We saw the enemy approach
White and shining like the blistering sun
The menacing King Dagnor
His damned army and him must fall

I call my brothers to war
To bring down the tyrant king
Our battle cries into the skies
Spear and shield clash and unite
Let our anger whip like the wind
And crush them under our might
Wave and wave after storm out and die!
To fight!!!

Faolan did cast his spear into the heavens
In the great maw of battle
My friends and kin die
We have fought and killed many
And onwards still we fight

In the cold dank earth
In the freezing winds
We run up the hills steadfast
And remain defiant
Till the last!

They face the tyrant king there
Among the hundreds of warriors
Clad in armour marble white and glimmering
Faolan flies forth and attacks him
A great battle ensues among the two
Bodies pile up and the mist of war rises
The spear screams in Faolan's hand
And pierces through the chest of the tyrant
The giant halls, the crash of his demise
Echoes through the vast landsI spill the blood in this night
Cast the spell in cedar woods
Collect the damned spirits into the flask 
Break the seal of the moon
Fulfill my lust for darkness
Devastate the sky for all eternity!

In the glare of serpents eyes
The last day's of the sun
Turn the sphere to deadly ice
A triumph to the forces of Hell

With the sword of thousand melten Stars
I will cut the sky apart 
Signs of sacrifice written in my scars
I drink the blood from dragons heart

With the sword of thousand melten Stars
I will cut the sky apart 
Signs of sacrifice written in my scars
I drink the blood from dragons heart

Ritual To The Black Serpent! 
Ritual To The Black Serpent!The wounds are bleeding and in need of treatment
And we need a respite now
Damn it!... We've lost this battle but not the war
We are not broken yet
Meanwhile I'm going into my veiled kingdom
The boundary between the worlds
Where the wind is summoning flocks of my ships of hate

The roar of the surf below the cliffs will heal my soul
And the echoes from the distant stars will answer to my call
I'm not alone

For now I need to stop and breathe this otherworldly air
The last delight for the one who was buried in the mute despair
And the strength will return
And my life will go on
And my soul will be reborn

One day we will restore our Earth empire
So let it rise like phoenix
This is
The only goal of our existence
The passion, the desire
But now I'm going into my veiled kingdom
The boundary between the worlds
Where the wind's raising burning banners over my ships of fire

Three abysses meet here
The sea, the time and the endless sky
Their voices sound within me
and they hear the words of mine
I'm not alone

For now I need to stop and breathe this otherworldly air
The last delight for the one who was buried in the mute despair
And the strength will return
And my life will go on
And my soul will be rebornThe burning embers of the dragon ship
Carry my remains towards eternal realms

To be divine and true
Battles without scars behold
Cause to strive and not to yield

This long house being structured
Family, Nation, victory

Battles under these symbols remain
choose to strive and not to yield

Victory or Valhalla
Hail!Never thought upon a million stars
That I would ever see a sight this bright
Now I have to walk into her light
Make sure I'll never fear her frightning eyes

I didn't even had a doubt in me
The brightest star I've ever seen
It shines on foreverMeine Hoffnung stirbt
Und mit Ihr meine Seele
Tote Gefuhle
Aus tiefster Finsternis
Verenden in unendlicher Qual
In Blut und Tranen
Erwarte ich mein Schicksaal
Endlose leere in mir
Und doch von Trauer erfullt
Ich ertrage das leben nicht
Das leben, dass an mir voruber ging
Die Menschheit lasst erfrieren
Was in mir noch lebt
Seelenlos ist die Welt, in die ich gekommen
Eine Welt, die es nicht verdient hat zu leben
Einsame Tranen versiegen im fahlen licht
Der Gedanke an den Tod der Menschheit
erfullt mich neuem leben
Eines Tages wird sie 
In meinem Massengrab sterben
Ich warte Tag fur Tag...(Instrumental)Elizabeth Bathory (Tormentor (Hun) cover)

... This is a story about Elizabeth Bathory 
Her blood is ourselves 
Clean Hungarian blood... 

Dark castle, occult carol sounds 
Women are crying, but they are satisfied 
Elizabeth didn't sleep tonight 
She exorcised her youth by her own eyes 

Dead girls are chaperoning her 
On her deadly magic-circle's lines 
She pricks needles under the ladies' nails 
Their frosty bodies are buried alive 

Oh how I love to feel your breath 
I'd love to be the lover of death 
Desires come true, evil prayers are heard 
By Elizabeth Bathory - the countess of my fire! 

You are also sacrifice 
You will give your blood 
Because she must 
Have a bath... 

"Welcome my youth 
Alike before... 
More enormous than ever! 
By the blood, by the blood everything are cleaned... 
Oh yes I've got the magic... Yes I feel I fly 
I fly towards the Moon!" 

Countess it is your night 
You are haunted by your wild desires 
Possessed by bestial lust 
You are the goddess of the love 

She's got insatiable mind 
She needs virgins blood anymore 
Her flames never die away 
She is surrounded with never-fading glory(Lyrics: Bes - June 2000)

Dusk begins the first chapter of
Nocturnal narrative
Nightmare comes into your sleep
You has the devil strife
Shadowy figures, wondering in forest mist
Waits for full moon, that the hunt begins.
Hunger...

Fear reigning in your blood
Blows up the veins inside
Night till dawn will be endless
It will witness bloody sight.
Killing stare of green eyes in mist
Growling from the dark before attack of beast.
Wolves...

Run, but they shall overtake you
Hide, but they shall find you
They are masters of night forest
Creators of heartrending moon nocturne.

Forest drowns your body
It brunches like claws of bird of prey
Scribble your eyes
Death will come, because wolves never delay.
Wolfish breath behind your back
You want to stop, you want to come back.
Dawn...

Diged up the grave & blood on stone
Lacerated meat on cold bone
You wake up by horror & fear
Wolfish nightmares nocturne disappear
Disappear...RAVEN'S FLY-BLACK HORIZONS

FEELING VENGEANCE AND HATE... WE THINK OF LAST TIMES.
NO ONE NEVER COULD SEE AN ARMY AS MIGHTY AS THE OURS.
FOR CENTURIES, THEY RULED WITH THEIR FALSE AUTHORITY...
NOW WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO END WITH THEM AND TO IMPLANT OUR EMPIRE.

DARK CLOUDS COVER THE SKY WHERE WE ARE,
AND THE NERVES GRADUALLY HOLD DOWN OUR BODIES.
WE LONG FOR CUT THE ENEMY'S NECKS WITH THESE SWORDS.
WE ARE WINDWARD AND WE CAN HEARD THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR TROOPS.
A FILE OF RAVENS ACCOMPANY US FROM THE DEPARTURE, AND WE FEEL STRONGER WITH THIS.
THE FOUR ELEMENTS GUIDE US IN THE PATH
WHILE THE WOLVES WAIT IN THE MOUNTAINS.

THE BERSERK WE PUT IN FRONT OF THE TROOPS.
BRAVE, AS NO MEN, WITHOUT OUR HELP WE CAN'T DEFEAT.
WE WILL BE THE FIRST IN ATTACK FOR GET WEAK TO THEIR MEN.

IT'S THE TIME TO FIGHT... THOUSANDS OF BODIES FALL QUICKLY.
WE ARE CONVINCED OF THE VICTORY, FOR THIS, FEW OF OUR MEN DIE,
AND THE MEN THAT DIE, DO IT WITH PRIDE AND HONOUR.

THIS PLAIN WILL COVER OF GRAVES ANNOUNCING OUR TRIUMPH.
THIS PLAIN WILL BE PROOF OF THE CHANGE OF EMPIRE.

AFTER THE BATTLE, THE LANDSCAPE, THAT BE LEFT, IS DEVASTATOR.
OUR WOUNDED WILL RECOVER AND THE DEADS WILL BE MOVE TO OUR LANDS,
SO THAT THE PEASANTS CAN ACCLAIM THEM AS REAL HEROES.
THEN THE HEADS OF THE ENEMIES WILL BE HANG AT OUR HOMES AS TROPHIES.

FINALLY WE HAVE LIBERATED TO OUR LANDS,
LATER GENERATIONS WILL THANK IT TO US.

RAVEN'S FLY-BLACK HORIZONSA thousand years ago
They gathered in the woods
To worship goat and moon
Pagan skyclad rituals

Mysteries of the forest
All known to them
Feared were they by men
Witches of the woods

Oh eternal shining Nanna
Grant me this ancient power
Legacy of the forgotten ones
Pagan dark witchcraftthe polarity of culminations 
seems mirthless 
once you vegetate 
in moderateness 

longing for redemption 
man is ever striving 
seeking calm and ease 
yet immune to fulfillment 

only the utter climax 
exceeds all expectations 
these are the principles 
of falling 

only the utter climax 
exceeds all expectations 
these are the principles 
of suffering 

so it strikes with great disruption 
the disquietude of mind 
forming its congruity to willVoices out of the depths of the mountains.
They were so cold,
that the frost let freeze our hearts.
Armed with sword and shield,
we marched to defend our people.
Dense fog and endless snow were interfering our march.
Anger, hate and eternal darkness enclosed us.,
as we plunged into battle.
Swords crashed on each other and shields broke.
Fire and death reigned the events,
as thousands of people declared war.
We had hardly any strenght left,
but our hate burned in flaming embers.
The sounds of forests, the voices of mountains extincted,
and our end had come,
filled with eternal pride.

(Thor)
Divine thunder symbol of virtue
held by the hands of eternity 						
By celestial defender
By his rune hammer

(Perun)
Divine lightning symbol of virtue
cries by wind the father of honour
By fiery pride
By his rune axe

By Drakkar, by hammer, by Thor
By arrival, by axe, by Perun

United by the fate of nations
Hand in hand sworn in unity

Defeated were the ancestors through the fire
by the only God. 
Burned were the sacred oaks by bloody hatred
under his false name.

By one soil, by one mother
the sons of ancient land.
Against the breath from the wind of time
forward towards what shall stand.

(Morana)
The realm of crystal the winter chill
Dead is the land where the silent voice shrills
She is the giver of death
Our loyalty to her is our debt 

(Hel)
Realm is hers beside the roots
By death the journey the last one chooses
The crying of the north
The ruler of Helheim.(Instrumental)Living from fight to fight,
The aim is to know and to conquer.
We crossed hundreds of rivers and braes.
Forest was our abode in the times of during long campaign
And we were part of the nature around us

Mountain ranges surmounted, vast oceans crossed
On land and water, the elements were hunted and tamed.
Together and separate
we've been through adventures only dreamers fancy
Stories that have become legends still told today.

Many a place turned into dust, other were glorified in unity
By swords, flames and will majesties were seized
Heads of the mightiest of kings bowed to us
With whip and white lies the hosts of common folk were enslaved.

Our fate had been inscribed in stone many an age ago
Yet few will understand the song of ancient truth.
Not on the world's highest mountain, when wind croons wistfully.
Not in the deepest forest nobody will hear the words unveiling the mystery of its wisdom.
Not even when the most barren places turn green.

Forbidden are the deeds of gods,
Vain are the questions where the world would go without us.
All that arose from nature will return again.
All wild, living by itself, outside the world of today's man.Among the human ghosts who never lived 
 eternity at last achieved 
 All universe had lost materiality 
 You fall into alternative reality 

 Eternity 
 Duality 

 All previous memories erased 
 There is nothing feels like form and weight 
 And like beginning and the end 
 At once you're rock and grain of sand 

 And what is fiction 
 You had been terrified 
 The cruel instintction 
 The Void of Nebulae 

 And what is real? What is fake? 
 And what to feel, to see, to take? 
 And no more reasons to regret 
 That you where alive and now you're dead 

 And what is fiction 
 You had been terrified 
 The cruel instintction 
 The Void of Nebulae 

 You're dead for all what lives in lies 
 Thinks their feels are real life 
 Thick balance on the edge of knife 
 The crucial moment has arrived 

 On the other side of your mind 
 Where is nothing to exist 
 Only shadows in mist 
 Do you call me your priest? 
 Want you find the way out? 
 Eyes opened wide 
 Deep in the night... 
 Void of NebulaeSunset's burning down
Cold streets are deserted
Tardy passersby are
Hurrying to their quarters

Only a little matchboy standing tired against the wall
He didn't sell anything
He has nothing to bring home tonight

On this Christmas Eve
Outer world is frozen
Consciousness just fades
Mind becomes so drowsy

Suddenly he sees a lady's face in this reverie 
Oh, it seems so unreal
Can you hear, she's appealing
To you

So listen to the whisper of Queen of the Night
Her celebration's started and you are invited so

She is calling
She is calling
The moment is right, take your fate in your hand -
You need just the night and unbending intent.

Let's make the fireworks
Of the wood and sulphur
Sequence of flashbacks
Time when you didn't suffer

Feel the warmth again, the serenity of a child
Spread your wings and aspire
You are free while the match 
Is on fire

Strike another match
Catch the new dream vision
Feel the freedom's touch
And then make a decision

Amonst the weak we roam in the days light, or cloaked in darkness hunters of the night. In search of those who've led our pack astray, we move in for the kill, then into the night we fade away. The only thing better than the catch is the chase. When your heart beats faster, your fear I can taste. Scream now but no one shall hear your cries, there's no one to save you, tonight...my wolves we dine. 
Invisible by the light, terror by the night, teeth shinning bright. ...WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! Swift and silent terror, killing without error, no feeling of care...WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! Emerging from the ruins, stalking by the moon, death approaches soon, WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! Hear the midnight howl, beasts on the prowl, seeking out the fowl, WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! 

Centuries have passed,we've survived the test of time,as masters of survival, and defenders of our kind. Foolish men have made atempts to drive us from our homes, as masters of our domain, we'll rip your flesh from the bone. Fifty years ago, after the great war. we took to the alps battered ,bruise, and sore. We regained our strength in a time to be sober, let the sheep know the wars not over. 

Invisible by the light, terror by the night, teeth shinning bright. ...WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! Swift and silent terror, killing without error, no feeling of care...WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! Emerging from the ruins, stalking by the moon, death approaches soon, WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP! Hear the midnight howl, beasts on the prowl, seeking out the fowl, WOLVES AMONGST THE SHEEP!Christ verrecke

Raben werden sich an euerem stinkendem Fleische laben

The life raped by tears and death. 
A sword crossing your eyes. 
My life and my universe feel the blood. 

I feel (that) the hand that feeds me, 
Nourishes obscurity. 
I feel (that) the hand that feeds me, 
Nourishes obscurity. 

The darkness envoy will burn you. 
Will feed off your skin, 
tearing it apart 
with its sharp wolfen fangs.

Asphyxiation corrupts the silence,

rottenness, but they 
return...(I) 
We weave the web
Vast as the great storm
Warriors to die
Blood spilled on that cloth
Steel of the spears
Woof of the red blood
For merciless battle
Web has been weaved

Web has been weaved
Of bowels of human
Plummet will be
On the bench made of sculls
Hackle of iron
And pins of arrows
By bloody spears
We weave the web

In the realm of war tomorrow
Feel no grief and feel no sorrow
To the realm of death we follow
Warriors sailing to the west
With the thousand swords tomorrow
Kill your pain and kill your sorrow
To the halls of mirth we follow
Let us follow our fate

Hjortrimull, Hild,
Sanngrid and Swipull
Bared the swords
And weaving the fate
Broken the spears
And broken the shields
The dogs of war
Have bitten them in

Landlords will come
From the lands far away
New king will come
From kingdom so far
Brian the Koenig
Is cursed and is doomed
Sigurd the Earl
Crucified on the spears

In the realm of war tomorrow
Feel no grief and feeA peaceful walk in October's rain
has come again
A drop of blood to call the hunters
you are the pray

Do you remember the nights we
walked these lovely fields
Where the dead roses grow
and it rains blood down here
On this valley of mysterious
red waterfalls
The only thing to hear is the
wolves cry that shatter the still

Every night, every day
Every fullmoon we came down here
Every night, every day
Every fullmoon we lived your dream

A peaceful walk in October's rain has
come to it's end
No more nightly hunts, no winds will blow
No wolves eyes glowIn the name of Satan I am bourne,
Bestow infernal powers unto me...
Shemhamforash

Ne'er the light my eyes to bear,
Grant me the joys of darkest sin...
Shemhamforash

Almighty ruler of the night,
Provide me with the gift of sweet revenge...
Shemahamforash
I kiss the throne, caress the musky hooves;
Heed the whines of deadly blasphemy...
Shemhamforash

In the name of Satan I am bourne,
Bestow infernal powers unto me...
Shemhamforash

Blessed are those of the left-hand path,
Cursed be the bastard Nazarene...
Shemhamforash

So it is done(Instrumental)A KINGDOM OF DEATH BEGINS FROM NOW ON

GLORY IS WAITING FOR USBreaking the ruin, through forces of doom,
Conquest for wasted warriors consume!
Clouds we steer in a wrathfully sneer,
Shedding clear a path that will endear!

Confidence in security we have grown,
Endless eternity on the throne,
Last rites secured inside our home!

Feel - the - last - force!
Rising to stand over command!
One last force - must enforce!
Bracing the land by our own hand!

Flames are racing, our fuming keg is gracing - beyond!
Congress praising the silver shine they're facing!

Inside the fortress our forces now thrive,
Aside the mistress remorse will hide!
Restless soul soldiers conquering toll,
And the patrol, for good has taken control!

Smashed astounding foundations taken grounding,
For the sounding envisioned final counting!

Confidence in security we have grown,
Endless eternity on the throne,
Last rites secured inside our home!

Feel - the - last - force!
Rising to stand over command!
One last force - must enforce!
Bracing the land by our own hand!

Flames are racing, our fuming keg is gracing - beyond!
Congress praising the silver shine they're facing!

And now we bear the sight,
Our vital fortress shielding bright!
A blaze thrown to the sky,
This shedding light you can't deny!

Instinct assures our reign is known,
Confident in security we have grown,
Endless eternity on the throne,
Secure your faith inside the last force!Darkness into your eyes again in the last night for the light
One look to see the black forest evilness in this time for fight
Night forever - black age is coming for all creations in the gray world
One sword against the light in your hands you keep for this time of fight
Died light, revenge...and coming darkness from the sky
In the mighty forest you are alone and ready for this battle
On fire now one touch and the death is here
To make the souls just shadows from the past
To make all creations slaves of the darkness for the rest of life
...Agony and death...
Up on the mountain you see the coming blackness
Dark clouds and tunders, they wants to show you
The new age - darkness forever
Religion, ready to die now, unknown enemy will destroy you with fire
And sword for the unholys, death to all religion
Black evil, black death...
Satan rulles with fear and death
No more life for the lost souls in the forest. Only graves and death for them
One man across the night, with sword of steel and blood
Over the hands of the pagan soul
Ancient gods and old rituals in the night of the new dark age
Sacrifice for the coming darkness...
Here in this black forest the life is dead
Here in this empty cave i live with the death
I wait returning of the pagan times
I wait the war against the light. I am the only one
I am born for this fight
Rise the death in these lands again. Rise the evilness
Make the path for the pagan times, path around the graves
Only a moment in the night, eternal darkness waiting
Final war for the crown, moment for the blackness coming
An empty dark world will be this world. Forever dead in his
maddness
Black forest throne rulles the night, i am here stending by your side
I am now alone and dark, i am ready for this fight
I will wait in the old castle of the death, the returning of the pagan times
I will save my hate to the battle for the times and the years
Waiting for the great age of the darkness. I am more than strong
We are the fate at now. We wait for this time too long...
We are the fear for this world...Lord of the woods
Ancient eyes and cloven hooved
He who lurks
In Arkadian shadows
Hear the bells
As he runs with the forest nymphs
Conjuring forth
Maddening states of ecstasy!

The forest
The spells
The darkness
Horned King of Arkadia

Lord of the woods
Dance around the pine trees
Playing the pipes
To the tune of the winds
The cults of war
Gather to fight the jewish god
We follow Pan
And drink the blood of Dionysus

Horned King... Thy glory is eternal
Keeper of the wild, enchanter of souls
Dionysian war unleashed in the woodsA golden dawn rises
From a night of carnage
We revel in the burning stench
Of disembowelled bodies

Their lies will reign no more
Slain by our blades of truth
They gaze upon their dying dreams
As their age of falsehood fades forever

No more pity for inferior life
No more crimes against natures design
Victory on the day of the sword
Final burning of their world

Slaughter, mortality, final pain
Now the enemies sign shall fade
Forever...See reflections

Look into the past
Fear and endless pain 
Sorrow was in your face, in your face
Sorrow was in your face
Do you feel hate
Ending, ending, descending

[Chorus]
Follow the dead
Your body turns into another shape
Follow the dead

Breakdown
Depressive hearts
A suicidal mark

[Chorus]
Follow the dead
Your body turns into another shape
Follow the dead

Look into the past
Fear and endless pain 
Sorrow was in your face, in your face
Sorrow was in your face
Do you feel hate
Ending, ending, descending

[Chorus]
Follow the dead
Your body turns into another shape
Follow the dead(Instrumental)The Devil of Rostov: Chapter 1 of "Chikatilo"

[written by Marc in December 1999]

Part I: The portrait

Black winter overcoat on his back

Dark sinister pores in the neck

Oblong face, longish nose

Sagacious glance so close

Refrain:

On the head a lambskin cap

In the right hand a shopping bag

A plain field, luminous sunflowers

Everywhere muddy grey towers

Black hills of coal-cinder

Weak young nerves to splinter

Feel his sensual, soft lips

See this romantic idealist

Meet the freak on his trips

Flee the instinctive artist

Three academic grades

Skin under the blades

Voluntary police-assistant

Insatiable kids-assailant

Refrain

Part II: The girl with the red coat

Unable to get an erection

Hates to touch female genitals

Acting under unholy protection

Inheritor of the true cannibals

Push the girl on the ground

Now begins the bloody count

Unbutton the red coat

On the river of death the boat

Stillness and submissive obedience

Pull down the white pants

Grant him your absolute obeisance

Sink in a death-wishing trance

Refrain

Childish eyes implore for grace

Now extinguished, dead cold face

Injure her sex, burning desire

Deep inside, a destroying fire

Stabbing knife in the neck

Throw the body in the streams

Turn away, don't look back

Quiet, docile, no more screamsAfter armageddon shredded pieces of the human race
Xenogenesis, mated into creatures free of hate
Immortals burn patterns through infinity
To shape the face and fate of Humanity
Don't make Octavia write for a hundred years
Because you treat black women as good as guys with pointed ears
Teach Kindred in a history class
Your kid's a guaranteed genius if they pass
Her characters evoke the same rich note
As if spoke from the baritone of her own throat
After Wild Seed's sown a new society's regrown
You'll never be alone, you'll sit beside her throne
Mind Of My Mind!Look into my eyes and you'll see your fate
Dancing in the shadows of the fairy-tales
Turn your-self off this world come with me
Turn your-self off let me show your dream
We shall see the place everything goes by
Somersaults in dew of the morning light
Spirit of the life dance is all around
Here we go to fly up high right now

Meditate my pupil you're not alone
Forget the time when you were on your own
Never be afraid to look around
Everything is yours don't let me down
Knowledge that you feel is so mysterious
That's the way that new reality goes
Strange world that you see is not a snare
Potion of the dream is boiling there

Salting leather rolling turning
Make my business witchery
Dreaming waiting hearing clouds
Are whispering to me
Riding horses of the sunrise
Calling spirits of the trees
Don't you see I got the knowledge
Of Ancient Mystery(Instrumental)Under life in to water
in a turbulent sea
a lament in to darkness
remember wrating words
with in of blood
for a crazy poet and maldit
A strange dream it bring near
to your reach
gold place and peak of silver
you will not fine a human
think
come back to a terrible time
and strange
Roar horror
entered in the arcane of time

for will ascend again and
takes possesion
of land, seas, and it that lives
in these

Thousand prayers in so long

honor

now they their days
with the cursed nightWeit im Norden wo kein Mensch mehr wohnt
Wo der Morgenfrost die Walder weckt
Und die Dunkelheit den Hunger stillt
Ist der Tod noch lebenwert
Jahrhunderte lange stille
Einsame, schneebedeckte Hugel
Auf denen keinen Baum mehr wachst
Erfullen den Traum des ewigen Friedens
Totale leere
Totale Trostlosigkeit
Totale Finsternis
Totale Harmonie
Gottes Glaube ist hier gestorben
Jesus Christus ist hier erfroren
Weite landschaft der Misanthropie
Monotone Kalte der Einsamkeit
Totenahnlichte Fiorde aus Eis
Erhalten die Visionen der Seelischen Ruhe
Ald der Fruhling einbricht
Als die Warme menschlicher Existenzen zunimmt
Als das licht des lebens einfallt
Hat der Krieg begonnen - die wahre Apokalypse(Instrumental)Your eyes have seen beyond holy darkness
No lies can stop the fate that's upon us
Rise, demons rise bring forth your black curse
No mercy for mayhem - no mercy for the dead
Hell's finally here
Mass graves and powers from hell we demand
Bloodstains are given upon his command
Fall from the sky your lord of no worth
Rise, Satan rise bring forth your black curse(Instrumental)I have lost my soul
To the realm of despair
Forever damned
Forsaken in hatred
Forever damned
Forsaken in hatred
I have walked this Earth
Walked right beside you
I have walked this Earth
I barely tolerate you
I'm driven to anger
By every action you take
The cause and effect
To trust is your mistake

I may just end your life
If you come too close to me
I have walked this Earth
Walked right beside you
I have walked this Earth
I barely tolerate you
I can feel you
Underneath my skin
We breathe the same air
But I pray the purge begin

I have walked this Earth
Walked right beside you
I have walked this Earth
I barely tolerate you
I'm driven to anger
By every action you take
The cause and effect
To trust is your mistake

The nihilist takes over
Bringer of death
I'll hate forever
To my very last breath
I can feel you
Underneath my skin
We breathe the same air
But I pray the purge begin

My soul consumed by hatred
My soul burns with the fires of malevolence
I have lost my soul
To the realm of despair
I can feel you 
Underneath my skin
We breathe the same air
But I pray the purge begin
Burn

The nihilist takes over
Bringer of death
I'll hate forever
To my very last breath
The nihilist takes over
Bringer of death
I'll hate you forever
To my very last breath(Instrumental)(Instrumental)I have seen the Holocaust Sin, I feel the dust within my damp bones
Days elapse slow painful, and I hear the brothers' screams and blood!
Enemies invade my senses before I am in the arms of Morpheus
But the Night is no more friend since time, Deads are tormenting
my murder Nightmares.
Every Soldier wich I have extinguished the soul, among the battlefield
is shouting Vengeance when my Heath's Nightfall comes,
among the worn blankets of a silent Camp, I know Dawn shall come
bringing an Army ready to eclipse our Glory Heart, that upon Blood we
erected, in the name of our Lord and Master.
Now my eyes are closing to leave humbling room to the umpteen
Nightmare, I wander thowards a streach, its colours have left any
natural semblance, in wich just few istants may relate a doom out of
time.Since the Black Sun has chosen my eyes as sacrificial victim, its
Rays of vitreous Fire have marked my Shadow without mercy,our Shields
are Ask under the Might of the Black Sun, our Armours, autumnal 
leaveslost in the Nightwind.
No sword can cross it, and it's deaf rumble overwhelms the screams of 
thousands souls, he shall brak every spear and turn our wretched
bodies in scorching embers, we are together tight in this whirl of frozen,
shattered souls.
A single unalterable istant divides this corrupted World from the
eternal purity,from the perfection of death. There shall be no tears and
blood to wet the soil, no foul corpses to feed the worms' Avidity.
Black Sun! Devour everything in thy supreme purity, in thy everlasting
Dominion, praise to thee Thunder! Hissing armies sweeping them away
in thy pillar of Holy Smoke, we ascend with thy curls to bring the light
God denied Us. climb the Oblivion Column. incited my the Grief wrath, to
fight our last battle, to deflagrate the stars with the Heat of War!
...AND THE RAGE OF THE BLACK FLAME...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)We prospect the deepest seam,
crawling in the blackest holes.
Obsessed by the treasures
of our holy ground.

Our fruits are made of stone,
We extract from innermost.
Our mountains bleed for us
and so we defend this pact with our blood.

Walls of boundary from otherness
Isenburg

Shelter for the brave
who fight for our home.
Nightmare for those who presume
to stain this ground.

Never surrender alive
nor leave this ground to enemy.
Often threatened by rats,
originless bastards.
Always had been defend
by swords of infernal rage.
Times may passing by
but the sons of the pride years are still here.
In arms we stand, reflecting the glorious days.Refrain:
"We will fight and stand, wild like wolves and 'til the end
We are proud and we are free for our gods and victory"

Again the enemies are passing our old fields
They came to plunder and to rape
They are coming to bring their belief
To our houses with fire, with death and with fear

Again we will rise, for our land, our families, our blood
Tonight we will fight, for freedom and for peace
With torture and pain they will break you
But we are strong and wild
We are fighting for our right
The right to live and to be free

Refrain

Stand strong, stand proud, stand free, be loud
Stand strong, for your right, stand proud and shout
Stand strong, stand proud, stand free, be loud
Stand strong, for your right, stand proud and shout

We are strong and we are proud, 
We are free and we are loud
Nobody will stop us, this is our gods will
This is our gods will

Legendary tales we bring
Of warriors of might we sing
Long forgotten tales we bring
Of wolves of might we sing

Hard we fought day and night
bones and iron we broke
Swords of ire and with iron will
the thunder of gods we brought

Hard we fought day and night
bones and iron we broke
Swords of ire and with iron will
the thunder of gods we brought

RefrainEndless alternate choices.... 
Other realities... 
Another me, 
another you, 
another everyone. 

Our future is hidden by smoke. 
We remain haunted by the past. 

Our world is shaped by persistence 
in the name of true will. 
Meaningless nothings 
push us further. 
To possibility 

Our futures disappeared in smoke while we 
wasted our lives talking to the dead.Darkness has found its way
Throught the passage of time
Soon the night will fall
Lights fade away

A night covered with hope is interrupted
Guarded by the stillness of the night,
She still hopes for resurrection
Forgetting the mighty powers of her dreams

For nights she's being dragged
Into profound worls
Worls filled with denying tears
Together in battle with the weakened hope
She conquers her uncoped past
Sweet little girl,don't hold on to the night
Hold on to the shadow of the future
Hold on to the intransparant light
And the silence of your tears

Let me be your inconcious mind
Open your eyes, and walk the path
That leads you to the past, and see

The future will be your saviour
Push away the burden that haunts you
Banish your tears and
Enter a world of hope and joy,

Let me be your inconcious mind
Open your eyes, and walk the path
That leads you to the past, and see

Love and joy are weak without grief
Do not forget the pain
But caress it as a token of your life

Go.... Go away...
Let me take you to the dark womb

For nights she's being dragged
Into profound worls
Worls filled with denying tears
Together in battle with the weakened hope
She conquers her uncoped past

For nights she's wandered
Through valleys of pain
She hopes but in the end
Eternity... Forever...At hyggjande sinne

God of Heaven 
Hear my cries of anguish, I'm in pain 
I've suffered a thousand deaths but I live on in vain 

Death would greet with eternal sleep 
My soul would come to peace 
My life had ceased 
The time was come 
Can no-one hear my plea 

Lowered down in the moistened ground 
Into the dark and cold 
My heartbeat the only sound 
Pain tears my limbs and soul 

I scream for mercy 
Hear my cries 
Oh, Lord don't abandon me 
I'm so tired 
Grant me the eternal sleep 

I tear at the lid I'm suffering 
In a cold and nameless grave 
If Hell is what awaits me 
I feel no fright 

Buried and forgotten 
In a cold and nameless grave 
If there's a God in heaven 
Hear my call from the grave...... 

[Repeat last two verses](Instrumental)My spirit wanders infinite planes without understanding the reasons.

Hear my calls!

Under the shadow of a broken being, I was answered, "Oh come to me oh evil one, wander no more. It is not false to think that darkness hides the truth, through darkness we learn, what I do is awaken your instinct to be one with the secret unseen knowledge."

"If you knew yourself and the planes that which you wander, I would not have found you."

My spirit soars!
My spirit soars!
My spirit soars!

At your side with your guidance we shall achieve the enigmatical understanding of the cosmos, and the unknown hidden truths.(Instrumental)In these days, when the sun no longer shines out of hapiness, but is
driven by pure hatred only. Creating all this energy out of sadness
for the current days. The moonshine reflects dull sorrowness.
Oppressed desires
controled chaos
stupid metaphysical concepts
and the sun revolts

We killed the sun
and we're slowly extinguishing

The sun dreams about, and longs for ancient times. A couple of centuries ago, which
were as bad as todays. Blind pathetic thoughts about "naive" times...
Escape in nostalgy... We're going towards an optimistic desaster. Which will make the
sun no longer shining, despite it's anger and hatred.

Damocles' sword: the sixth day
God created Adam
Drunk
And from that day on, they cursed the day their agony started, until soon to come.

We killed the sun
and we're slowly extinguishingFill the void with absence madness 
Through the sufferers crypt 
Exposed from the annihilation 
Of societies fist 

Reincarnated 

Feel it tighten up around your neck, societies noose 
Try to reach, try to run away 
You get their iron claw 
It's all a fucking a waste, an abortive attempt 
Try to see through the dark 
But the somber reigns 

Try to reach the annihilation of societies fists(Instrumental)Do you think I'll watch my culture be destroyed in vain? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think I'll bow down and go with the grain? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think I'll follow false prophets to my doom? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think the end of our race is coming soon? NO, NEVER!!! 
Defiance to you and all you stand for? Defiance to you and your kind! Defiance to you and all you stand for? Defiance to you and your kind! 

...Do you think I'll watch my culture be destroyed in vain? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think I'll bow down and go with the grain? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think I'll follow false prophets to my doom? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think the end of our race is coming soon? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think you have us in your stranglehold? NO, NEVER!!! Do you think I'll sit back and watch our cultures demise? NO, NEVER!!! Will I ever surrender or compromise? NO, NEVER!!!

Angkara Murka(Instrumental)In these moments, 
my emotions flow like a breeze of endearing wind 
it roams through my hair 
Cold or warm 
tensing or unwinding 

I hear a voice, a silent whisper 
"Open your mind, try to understand" 

In these moments, 
the need of silence fills my heart 
Something in my mind 
I never realized 
How could I overlook? 

Now I begin to see, it tells me 
"Open your mind, try to understand" 

In these moments, 
it is dripping into my brain like heavy stones 
falling into silent water 
But my eyes are strong 
keeping it inside 

I'm feeling a change, where will it take me? 
"Open your mind, try to understand, let your heart feel the pain" 

..and my heart felt the painOpen your eyes and see

Open!
Open my eyes and see
Eyes and see
The root of my memories
Standing
Standing here in front of
In front of
My conscious soul denied

Fire!
Right in the centre of thy hearth
Walking straight
Into forgotten memories
How can you see?
Now, in the mirror of time
Mirror of time
The creation of a love

This all reflexes in me
A blade of fears that draws to death
The crimson stains paint my dress
Your beautiful skin, our sinister fate
This death

Soul dead as a doornail
Feelings gone in emotions stream
Doesn't matter what was
Doesn't matter what will be

The rain can't wash away

Rain!
The rain can't wash away
Wash away
Away the crimson stains
Fire!
Scarred the weak ring of
Weak ring of
The chain of events called life

Rebirth can fill the void
Haunting you from the past
Awakening is the aim
Cause your soul's not faded away
This death

Soul dead as a doornail
Feelings gone in emotions stream
Doesn't matter what was
Doesn't matter what will be

I'm marked by the crimson stains
Can you really see them?

Now it's time to break the chains
I have to wash away the stains

Soul dead as a doornail
Feelings gone in emotions stream
Doesn't matter what was
Doesn't matter what will beVerdoemenis aan de vreemde

declare my appearance.
Maggots under my shadow,
you follow my steps, you know my intent.

No life behind, no future before me,
so in past and so forever.

Making no difference nor being a slave of sense,
my game is to interrupt your illusion of justice.

Feeding from endless pain,
Master of insanity, conqueror of flesh.

I'm no fallen angel,
I'm a son of you.
Without wings - no chance to fly above,
damned to turn the pandemoniac wheel.Memoriae meae 
ad praeteritum longinquum 
uertuutur 

Erat eques equitaus 
et recedeus per montem 
ad lucuus obscurum 

Tempestas imminens erat 
Odor mortis in aere uagabat 

Lucus niger se horizonten dilatabat 
Secretum ensis erat clavis 

Dies niger in tempestate medievali fuit 
Dies niger in tempestate medievali fuit 

Dies in tempestate medievali fuit 
Dies in tempestate medievali fuitTurned by wicked illness into a slave
Through the night he roams, spreading the stench
Denied by the people, he rose against them
In the silence of woods he found his rest

He walks through the forest and burns the earth with hate
Sowing fear, inspiring loathing, cursed is his fate
For many years he roams as a symbol of death
The evil oh so strong, much stronger than the good

Like a thief he creeps in the dark
Bringing hate to the light of the sun
World of living lost once for all
Only evil tearing his soul

He walks through the forest and burns the earth with hate
Sowing fear, inspiring loathing, cursed is his fate
For many years he roams as a symbol of death
The evil oh so strong, much stronger than the good

He eats stinking carrions
Stolen from worms 
He sucks with greediness water
Out of rotten stumps

Where the dead moves nature dying
Forest dwellers walk aside him

Under his feet, grass turns yellow
Leaves fade away
Mournful wolfish howl is his herald
Wherever he may stray

Beware belated wanderer
Walking through this ancient place
Your death may be hiding
Where you can never awaitThe wind still writes 
All the same fairy tale 
Blowing to the north 
Away to the end
I envy the blue moon 
Never left by the stars 
I envy the ocean 
Always passes the sea shore
These feelings I hold 
Are the unbroken dream 
To hold u by 
At the nearest heart beatin'
If the time may see me 
I would tell a lot 
How u weren't suppose to leave 
And left me in painWhen the traces are hidden in the mist
When the cold blood is waking up the beast!
When the sharp spines of ice grinds
When your life is blown by the Northwinds!

Oh,sweet majesty of coldness
Show me the path to your secret fort
Embrace me with your windy veil
Illuminate the way with you shiny crown
Oh,mother nature the almighty one
Freeze the World with your icy breath
The northwinds are the spirits of the gods
And the wolves are their inner voices...

Northwinds!

When the traces are hidden in the mist
When the cold blood is waking up the beast!
When the sharp spines of ice grinds
When your life is blown by the Northwinds!

Oh, sweet majesty of coldness
Show me the path to your secret fort
Embrace me with your windy veil
Illuminate the way with you shiny crown
Oh, mother nature the almighty one
Freeze the World with your icy breath
The northwinds are the spirits of the gods
And the wolves are their inner voices...

Northwinds...
Breath of the gods...
Carry us away...

When the traces are hidden in the mist
When the cold blood is waking up the beast!
When the sharp spines of ice grinds
When your life is blown by the Northwinds!


Oh, great poetry of wind scourge
Lead them to the long fields of death
Write the last part of their stenches
Send them to the unknown abysses
Oh,great mother of snow and ice
Entomb their bodies under frozen lakes
Spread the neverending winter rage
Your womb shall never be ignited!

Northwinds!

Carry us away...(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Since you left this realm of living, Time has ceased existence. Your memories remain with me for eternity. An eternal sleep shall stir your immortality, until we one day shall meet under the stars. For your star once shined for all to breathe, it now shines forever in me, and in the midst of my heart. Your words of wisdom ehich you instilled upon my soul shall forever flow through my veins, until one day we shall reforge our alliance and carry on our quest through time, and towards the stars....Und unter meinen Schritten
bricht sich die Welt
in hunderte Facetten

Aus den Splittern meiner Welt
setz ich mein Spiegelbild zusammenHe continued looking for, spreading illnesses, 
Until giving with the barrow of Glamr. 
At least the pleasure would be given of devouring his bones, 
And he would continue with his devastation 
Until finding the rest. 

He finally arrived at the mound 
Where Glamr was buried. 
He entered in the howe, 
Only to discover that Glamr 
Neither he rested:
Glamr was also a draugr. 

Glamr and Thoromir fought, 
Draugr against draugr, 
Undead against undead, 
During hundred seventy nights, 
Only paused 
Just to calm their insatiable hungers 
Destroying livestock and farms 
Along the whole Nordic coast. 

Thoromir triumphed,
He devoured Glamr, 
But he could not rest. 
Until the appearance of a hero, 
Protected by Oddhinn, perhaps, 
A certain Grettir who beheaded Thoromir 
And buried him with his head 
Between the thighs. 
And Thoromir, after his destruction step 
From the extreme south more to the south of Vinland, 
Was able to rest, without standing up never more.(Instrumental)MARCH!On a mountain
Stands a man in black
He raises his fist to the
Northern sky
Bound to be free,
Baptized in fire and ice
A man of the North,
Proud like the sea

High and mighty like the gods!

High and mighty!

Mighty and high
He raises his fist to the night
And shouts to the gods,
A voice that cracks the sky
Facing the wind
He sees the stormclouds gather
Raising the waves of Ymir's Blood

High and mighty life the gods!

High and mighty!(Instrumental)You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony...
...of destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony...
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony...
Swaying to the symphony...
...of destruction

The Earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
Awarring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony...
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony...
Swaying to the symphony...
...of destruction(Instrumental)Sorrow, hate,
eternal loneliness enclosed us.
The pain, so cold,
as we marched through the forests.
Once again, we played the songs of our people.
Strains of eternal sorrow.
Our tears in flaming embers,
nothing we coul hear,
only the eternal stars.
No hope,
no will.
Nothing was left in us.
Agonies of a lost battle were in us, so cold.
Dark fog closed our eyes,
in lonely coldness.

By AramathA Great tower of oak, rising to the stars up high.
The cosmic strength of a god, awoke,
Holding the death of the sky.

Irmin! Allfather.
The belief in you cost us our heads.
A thirty year war and oppression after.
Four thousand five hundred, our brothers dead.

The steel touching our ancestors' throats.
We hear the deaths of their screaming ghosts.
The warmth on their necks as the blood flows.
As cold as the blade of their hosts.

Baptism forced on pain of death.
Some of our men fought back.
Resistance even in their breaths.
In Irmin's name they attacked.

The Frankish king brought it down.
Our pillar to Irmin that held up the sky.
As the men in mail came to our towns.
On the orders of Karl we were sent to die.

Irminsul! A pillar to our gods!A sorcery written in blood 
Whispered by a Witch in the dawn 
Summon the darkness pure evil and death 
And gather the legions of scorn 

The darkness possesses you your soul scream in vain 
Tonight the Hellfire shall burn 
Thunder and lightning the ancient prediction 
The bells chime for Satan's Return... 

(Blasphemy 
Sorcery) 

It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil 
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame 
It's the RETURN of my master Satan 
It's the RETURN of desire and pain 

Sacrifice a virgin to the flames of burning Hell 
Black Witch of beauty recite the words of spell 
Gather masses run in circles scream for mercy cry of pain 
No mercy for the blessed in Hell you all will burn in lord Satan's name 

Now descend from the burning blasting sky 
Holding the reigns ride the night 
Satan appear in full glory and pride 
The raped souls of Heaven cries 

Blasphemy 
Victory 
Desecration 
Hell and damnation 

It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil 
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame 
It's the RETURN of my master Satan 
It's the RETURN of desire and painIn the darkness of his mind
He is weaving webs of lies
Lurking in his filthy den
Waiting for the moon to rise

Spreading vile and vicious thoughts
Which pervade the stinking air
All is rotten and decayed
All around his squalid lair

There are foul and noxious fumes
Mists grow thicker on the ground
People start to feel his power
They're no longer safe and sound

Fog is dense it blinds their eyes
All they feel is growing fear
For the first time in their lives
They know their death is near

Softly whispered words of hatred
Come to their dirty ears
Overwhelmed by sudden terror
Eyes are full of welling tears

Face contorted in great panic
Tears are flowing in wide streams
You will never get away
From the king of our dreamsPerversion is the law
The storms have now been called
Black candles are now lit
Feel the wax as it drips, ow!
I've got ya where I want ya
On your knees, screams of blasphemy
Moonlite degradation satanic crust
Howling incantations fall to dust
Screams of blasphemy
Leatherbound in chains
Feel the spike in your veins
Reach for the masters hand
Fall unto command, right!
The ritual's taken place
and done in such poor taste
We shall again return
This town will once more burn(Instrumental)my pagan ancestors call my name 
through the white waterfalls of norway 
from the dark and misty forests 
from the mighty snowfilled mountains 
through the winds of the northern sea 

it's been more than a thousand years 
but still i am proud 
still i am, norse 
still the father of the north 
embrace my soul 

through the white waterfalls of norway 
from the dark and misty forests 
from the mighty snowfilled mountains 
through the winds of the northern sea 

let the fields and homes 
turn into fire and blood 
let the lambs be wolves 
once again 

i feel a pagan breeze 
from the storms of the northern sea 
let the northland of supreme 
be the north of my dreams 
once again 

through the white waterfalls of norway 
from the dark and misty forests 
from the mighty snowfilled mountains 
through the winds of the northern sea(Instrumental)Explosion! 
Half the humankind extinct, half the Earth is erased 

Look at the sun, do you see it in the sky? 
Night all day long, 3 winters without light 
Here come the flames, burning humanity 
Here come the waves, erasing destiny 

Explosion! 
Half the humankind extinct, half the Earth is erased 

Look at the sun, do you see it in the sky? 
Night all day long, 3 winters without light 
Here come the flames, burning humanity 
Here come the waves, erasing destiny 

Down! 
The men faint in darkness, this is a 
Reborn! 
A new chance to take, a new life begin 

Never rising sun! 
The sun rising again 
Never rising sun! 
Humanity will surviveBurning black, the wicked unholy eyes
Watching the lamb, squirming in a blood pool
Suffering animal, bleeding to its death

At the black sacrifice, the bonfires are lit
Rising towards a black moonlit sky
At the black sacrifice, we drank the blood
From a chalice passed down from our ancestors times
At the black sacrifice... At the black sacrifice...

Drink the blood of christ
At the black sacrifice...

Burning black, my hand grips the dagger
Cutting the throat of the lamb of god
Suffering animal, bleeding to its death

At the black sacrifice, i offer a virgin
Screaming bitch, drives me insane
Quit your crying, god is deadWar steeds stand in an endless era
On fields of mist prepare their weapons
Sound the horn and heed to their call
As warriors ready their shields
Attack and reap the rewards of plunder
Drink froth and mead to praise the gods
And as I climb the highest mountain
I hear the echoing cries of ravens...

Odin in the great hall Valhalla
Reading runic scriptures of time
You died with honour, and died with valour
Into the forest buried spirits arise
There is no fear of death
The victory is near upon us
We shall forever claim this land
The land that is rightfully ours!

Odin in the great hall Valhalla
Reading runic scriptures of time
You died with honour, and died with valour
Into the forest buried spirits arise
Valhalla's ravens feast on blood
The vikings stayed true to their roots
Heroes of Asgard rise up and raise your horns
As they will never back down from a fight!

The helm of awe, by honour they live
As we hail the gods! Onward to Valhalla!
The helm of awe, with glory he dies 
As we hail the gods! High above Asgard!
The helm of awe, by honour they live
As we hail the gods! Onward to Valhalla!
The helm of awe, with glory he dies 
As we hail the gods! High above Asgard!Definire signum lucana ater

The holy powers
Let me be the flesh that wields your swords of revenge
Brave men who lived in those days are not forgotten
Heroes will once again emerge
And the holy spirits shall awaken
From their slumber to aid them in battle

Plunging the enemies

Night is to come
A roaming thought
Tread further
Led by, escorted by
A talisman hid into a leatherbag
Inside, inside
Hid in fog
Where ground of moss
Covers, cloaks
Its being for death
Gathering among the stone

A crash from the ground
Blood breaking up
Song of woods creaking, squeaking
The night is but
An ardent murmur of the dead

Wismen on the tree
Hooting hour after hour
Restless shaggy horde
Howling by the mountainside
Cry mourning into the face,
the wrinkles of the spelling Moon
Sing for the
Decaying ones in forest litter
Murmur words
For coming crowns of trees
For they feel the end of good days
Mourning mountains rule, grow immense
For the new Mother Earth
Aiag (Gaia)!WILL BE A DARK NIGHT
CHIA IS WITH US
DEVOTED TO THE WARRIORS 
FOR THE GREAT BATTLE

UP IN THEIR ARMS 
THEY DEFEND THEIR HILLS
WILL BE A CRUEL WAR 
BLOODSHED !!

IN NAME OF OUR GODS 
WE WOULD PROCLAIM THE VICTORY
THEY WOULDN'T HANG OVER OUR HEADS
AS WAR TROPHIES

WALKING THE FOREST THE FOG LIES IN SEARCH TO THE WARRIORS
THEY THRISTY OF VICTORY 
HONOR TO THEY ANCESTORS

THE ENEMY WAS BEHIND THEIR HILLS
THE WIND IS FAVOR US
IS TIME TO FIGHT FOR THE HONOR

AT DAWN 
XUE SHALL GUIDE US

PREPARE YOUR ARMS
BATTLE WILL BE !!

UP IN YOUR ARMS
FOR HONOR TO FIGHT !!Driven from their homes, their streets up in flames, forced into the open, into a sea of pain. Once found memories of better days gone by, all become lost with every tear they cry. 
They flee to the west with their daughters and sons, to escape death and the roar od it's gun. What kind of future does fate have in store, will they survive or become victims of war? 
Forced from their homes, driven from their land, Survival by chance in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! Battered and beaten yet they try to stand, they must move on in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! 

Prisoner of war, captured at the Front, in the rubble you bore the brunt. Marched into the streets in humiliating defeat, being spat upon, cursed upon, kicked and beat. 
Sent to Siberia, morale is getting low, will you ever see your family, will you ever see your home. You've got to hold on, you've got to keep faith, for your spirit and body they're trying to break. 

You swore the oath to your fatherland, now herded like cattle in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! Honor and dignity the foe can't understand, They weren't in your place in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! 

These are victims that time had forgot, bombed, beaten, and left in gulags to rot. They stood accused, accused by the blind, believing in their land was their only crime. 
Some call it loyalty, some call it treason, what is a world that can not see reason. How can one cast blame upon a nation, when victors lies breed humiliation. 

Forced from their homes, driven from their land, Survival by chance in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! Battered and beaten yet they try to stand, they must move on in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! You swore the oath to your fatherland, now herded like cattle in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED! Honor and dignity the foe can't understand, They weren't in your place in the... MARCH OF THE DAMNED!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)For as long as the grass grows
For as long as the stream flows
And the sun shines down unto those
For how long the wind blows
And the sky is blue above us

O, I am a man and I hold in my hand my fate
Free as the wind as if even
I had wings that carried me
Still in the middle of the night
Even I will need light to guide me
So I turn my face to the sky from
Where he with one eye is watching over me

My fathers' gods - I ride for you
My fathers' gods - I fight for you
My fathers' gods - I die for you
My fathers' gods - I am coming through to you
My fathers' gods - I am yours

Through blood by thunder
Sound of wings in the air and
his ravens fly near to lead me
So I will not fail to ride down the trail
long time destined for me
long before I was born

O, can you not see it is all
carved in the tree of fate
That a son of the north must fulfill
his destined course to
follow the bond of blood

Bond of blood Bond of blood(Instrumental)I wish to leave existence floating on a cloud of smoke
separate from the body leave behind nerves flesh and bone
I will ascend to tell the angels that fear is a choice
no wings will carry me no flames will burn my soul

Time will disgrace your dying savior
whose blood has designed our greatest failures

We're all encased in caskets born to serve machines of doom
injected blood and terror flows into our open wounds
with every strain passed through my lungs I find a new escape
no cult shall bury me this life is mine to take

Time will disgrace your dying savior
whose blood has designed our greatest failures

I will transcend this reality and set the chaos free
to banish the light and take away all hope for mankind
we have gathered this night to summon a storm upon the world
sacrifice to the dawn all lies and past scorn

I wish to leave existence free me from machines of doom
separate from the body released from my open wounds
I will ascend to tell the angels find a new escape
no wings will carry me this life is mine to take

Time will disgrace your dying savior
whose blood has designed our greatest failuresI don't wanna hear your excuses all the time
Making us waste our money and playing with our minds
Quit your filthy jokes they thrill me to the spine
Out of control are the violence and the crime

Living in a world where the poor is the weak and the bad guy
Law's as fucked as the girls in the corners at night
Living in a world where the children are taught just a bunch of lies
People is losing control and can't find the way out

World's police
They'll fuck you if they find you
World's police
Keep the control
World's police
They lie to us all!!!

Working day by day to get a piece of bread
Living for today, never think of the future
Trapped inside a cage with no way to escape
Your dreams start to fade as your life goes away

Running to the abyss of commercialism
No one can hide from the prices so high
The same are the priests and the politicians
And the birds don't fly anymore in the sky

World's police
They'll fuck you if they find you
World's police
Keep the control
World's police
They lie to us all!!!I'm coming back in to bright lands
From the past times sleeping in darkness
"Stop your roaming", call the fathers
Who keep the Time in bright lands

Sunshine our land - dispersing the dark
Restore the motion of the times
Sunshine our land - filling with fire
Faith of tribes in sunny lands

Keeping a secret word in the stones
Hiding decay of wills in the barrows
Winds which rustle in crowns of trees
Disturbing the Memory they will revive it.

Sunshine our land - dispersing the dark
Restore the motion of the times
Sunshine our land - filling with fire
Faith of tribes in sunny landsBetween shadows in my mind
Between bright sparks in my eyes
Between voices in my head
Madness's creeping
Like a snake
I can't awake

The mirror I hate
Reflection that's fake
In my eyes I see
Truth on that side
And it's me
Who can't hide

You are my freedom
Madness in my mind
Outside the window
World that's passing by
Under the pillow
Back to the dreams of life
Can't kill my demon
It grips me up inside

It feeds and crawls under my skin
Deeper within
Through the bones and into echoes
Of my body
Vision which stained
My merciful brain
Insane's my pain
I'm cursed
And blamed

On my nightmare's fields
The fallen god with his throne
The ressurection that kills
His demons're dancing around
Whispers I hear in my ears
Voices of comprehension
Beyond the endless horizon
Approaching salvation

You are my freedom
Madness in my mind
Outside the window
World that's passing by
Under the pillow 
Back to the dreams of life
Crushed is the mirror
It comes my time

I'll swallow the pills
This night of fears
No regrets no tears
Free all miserable sins
The believer of chaos
My name's imagination
Shall I pray or confess
Addicted to frustration

The me in you
The you in me
I'd rather killed myself
Than let you leave 

You are my freedom
Madness in my mind
Outside the window
World that's passing by
Under the pillow
Back to the dreams of life
I'm the demon
The evil deep insideOh fathers I call thee
to witness m decree
by honour, by blood and on this sacred oak
I'll never give in to the lies of the false messiahs
by honour, by blood and on this sacred oak

I raise my hands up to the sky
And call thee gods above
My prayers roam high
this ancient lore I call
I raise my hands up to the sky
And call thee gods above
My prayers roam high
This is my holy oath

Our fathers in heavens
Hallowed be thy names
Give strength to your children
And let your enemies be slain

I raise my hands up to the sky
And call thee gods above
My prayers roam high
this ancient lore I call
I raise my hands up to the sky
And call thee gods above
My prayers roam high
This is my holy oath

The embers that burn for your eternal memory
We raise your fists and sand hails to your glory

I detest the lord of lies
No man is equal to the gods

False prophets who want me to join their lies or die
I'll never sell my soul, I'm faithful to my ways

I detest the lord of lies
No man is equal to the godsEvery day, every night,Until we die
We are viking brothers
Days will come and go
We are fighting the world
We are viking brothers
Triumph at last, we'll never forget
We are viking brothers

We have killed, we have bled
And new battles will come
Many have fallen, we still stand
The fire still burns
They know this day is their last
Last moments, last breath
We have chosen our fate
They know it is too late

Every day, every night,Until we die
We are viking brothers
Days will come and go
We are fighting the world
We are viking brothers
Triumph at last, we'll never forget
We are viking brothers

By the ravens of Odin, Memory and thought
By the hammer of Thor
By the hand of Tyr, By the spear Gungnir
Spread the word, the way of the warrior
In Asgard live forever
When the time comes we will join
The army of immortals

Everytime we ride
We are ready to die
Side by side we ride
Viking Brothers until we dieForefathers draw
Runes on this cliff
I feel a breath
Of the past
Lapping of gray waves
Near my feet
I resurrect in memory
The past

[Chorus:]
Listen to the old gods -
They're so alive
In my brain I hear they
Forever stained cry
Listen to your heart
Up to peak of pleasure
Here eternal spring
Inaccessible treasure

I taking off
My clothes
I give myself
To northern wind
Easy like a plume
I fly away in skies
Winds whisper
In my ears the lullaby

[Chorus.]Between three heights
Firstborn of three nights
Was freed in sacrifice

On sleep of bone I fell
Wrapped in bark of nameless weald
Blind my sight with wealth
For wraiths my gaze beheld

On grey wood sheared
Black plated names
To shores of the dead
Light my sail aflame

Wash away the shrift
On lake of regret
And release me adrift

Neither moon nor sun
On house of the vanished one
We mourn in wordless tongue
We mouth the grief unsung

One gone forever will not grieve
One lost forever will not dreamI. Journey with Light

Pursuing, urging, driving me forward - this raging desire
In my arms sit my tomorrows -
behind me desire
The light shines on me! - Enough!
Finally, once more
it raises me up!
Autumn clouds n' wintery breezes, summer rejuvenation
Curious feeling,
always scheming
Shooting me full of poison.
Far-away whispers,
invalid sceptre
No more royal blessings
The glowing throne
blazes with fire
Deceased hope,
deceased King
The light shines on me! - Enough!
Finally, once more
it raises me up!
Wild, evil, wicked souls spewing fire and lighting
Incredulousness
and sheer chaos abound!
A new regime casting
new blessings
from a new throne
Building its sin-ridden town!
The light shines on me! - Enough!
Now it's over,
it'll never raise me up...!

II. Dismal Sorrow

Whenever I see
the sun shine,
I open up my window wide
Far in the hazy distance untainted hope
shimmers bright
Sweepeing
the weather-beaten fields,
the wind brings new energy
I hear the sound of changes...there's a feeling of pride in meDismal sorrow's all I hear now...
Sleeping with tears
in my eyes...
The show is already over,
we can't recall
how it started now
The curtain's already fallen, the public cloakroom's
empty now
The city's woefully sleeping, they see the film beforehand
Yes, a blessing cries out to me, but my soul is a barren wasteland Dismal sorrow's all I hear now...
Sleeping with tears
in my eyes...
Blind hope's still alive!
Why am I frightened?
Why am I alive now?
Bloody sword
gets carried around
the ritual may now proceed
Steadfast faces
face the music,
I know there's no clemency
I'm cursed by the light!
I know I'll never survive!
Blood flowing
all over my face!
There's no escape!
Dismal sorrow's
all I hear now...
Sleeping with
tears in my eyes...
Blind hope is still alive!
Why am I frightened?
Why am I alive now?
FINAL SOLUTION...!

Talubsi! Aduya! Ulu! Baachur!Come Azathoth, come!

Stars are shining on the freezing winds of the North,
Between moors and swamps a Eminence rises dark,
Come Azathot, your Blind Fury will shatter the Universe,
Reality has decayed and Disgust pervades every thing,

A sullen presence of a Mad Necromancer advances majestic over the hill,
In his sick visage is painted th gloomy Destiny of Humanity,
Come Azathot, your Blind Fury will shatter the Universe,
Reality has decayed and Disgust pervades every thing,

Bloody arcane symbols are carved on the frost unholy ground,
Five black candles on the Pentacle's tips light the Nigth's Embrace,
The Necromancer slowly parts his lips reciting his Evil Litany,
Behind a deadly mist and a host of glares the appear of the Unmentionable Sultan,

Earth's Empires are giving way under the Weight of His Wrath,
Skies are torning open and Blood flows through the paths,
Come Azathot, your Blind Fury will shatter the Universe,
Reality has decayed and Disgust pervades every thing,

Moanings, weepings, screams and cries are turning a Simphony,
At the following day the Sun has fade to black,
Come Azathot, your Blind Fury will shatter the Universe,
Reality has decayed and Disgust pervades every thing,

The forgotten Memory of the Necromancer has opened wide the Infernal Gates,
His heroic cursed Soul shouts in the Limbo of Ages,
His Sacrifice hasn't been vain since now the Empious has been destroyed,
Azathot and His Greatness have been the Instruments of the Triumph of Evil.(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Sometimes you're wondering
Where are you from?
And where is
the breeding of your home
They told you many lies
You're born for a sacrifice
Initiation to the bone
Chorus:
The dogs have decided where is the
promised land
Where a bloody hand is moving
through the sand
Forces are fighting for the
human rights
Rabid bytes demolition's mights
The order was so clear
Let's kill them all
Bullets are flying to the wall
There's nothing left to fear
There is no justice here
Your master
is waiting for the gold
I can't believe it
Where is my life where is my home
My mission was secret
But my death will be known
So I can't believe it
They wrote my name on a stone
My cross you can keep it
Cause I'm a sinner to the boneRecruiting troops across the oceans and lands,
with common grace in metal faith - it is time to take a stand!
A solid vision of what has risen at hand,
we will come forth and raise our fists, salute to metal's command!
So raise your flask towards a fortunous sky!
Dream out upon, forever strong we will rise!
A force as one has band together realize,
you can't stop Goat Horn - you'll just meet your demise!

We (we are) the rotten roll revolution,
with the ultimate solution,
for our glorious shrine,
that you cannot deny!

Ya now who has come to survive,
we have a nation on a mission - of course, can't deny,
we're on our way as promised lands they arise,
a threatening force collecting cries,
driving all waste aside!
Now riding free our land has shifted the tide,
before all war we stand forever the force shall subside,
break like the wind and sail the waves full of pride,
our breath shall never settle,
for we are made of heavy metal!

We (we are) the rotten roll revolution,
with the ultimate solution,
and our glory will shine,
and there's no place to hide!

We rot - for warning courses are taught.
On top - our calling kind are sought.
To fight - disloyal patrons with might.

Far wide - we take the longer stride.
Abide - in collective thrive.
Upside - allied we will provide.

We (we are) the rotten roll revolution,
heavy metal is our solution,
and it's glory will shine,
you've got nowhere to hide!Veil of darkness, veil of lies death and pain
My hate will live beyond these cold remains
I curse you with my last breath's cry
Veil of darkness, frozen veil of lies

Spell cast, eyes blur sightless 
Howling winds shriek with laughter
Rising waters, hate and horror
Fear the dim and what comes after

Veil of distance, veil of shadows and sighs
Coiled in sleep I bind your useless eyes
Whispered silence, your soul comes to me
Veil of distance, a cold and twisting sea

Spell cast, eyes blur sightless 
Howling winds shriek with laughter
Rising waters, hate and horror
Fear the dim and what comes after

I own you, all is now mine
Beyond the grave, I live in your mind
I rule you and all you wanted
The living damned, cursed and haunted

I'd stop to think of what I ask for
Turning locks and breaking sealed doors
I slept alone not by choice
Entombed below, rising to the call of your 
voice

I own you, all is now mine
Beyond the grave, I live in your mind
I rule you and all you wanted
The living damned, cursed and haunted

I own you, now and always
Soul chained till the end of all days
I rule you as you wanted
The living damned, forever cursed and 
hauntedSpitting on the chosen and defying hebrew rule
depropagating the bastard seed of zion
cleansing the genepool through holy pagan war
over vast oceans of time the corruption has spread throughout
over vast oceans of time we have carried the flame of our fathers

Warriors of the aryan sun
under the banner of the solar cross
aloof - on the mountain top
we kill for the honour of our race and gods
in the aryan dawn!

we take the arms - a legiom of barbarian wrath
spitting defiance - antihexagonical fury
purging the cesspool through pure white tyranny
exterminate and sterilize - our guns are silent nevermore
exterminate and sterilize - our fires buring evermore

Warriors of the aryan sun
under the banner of the solar cross
aloof - on the mountain top
we kill for the honour of our race and gods
in the aryan dawn!

Soon the world will glow in perfect harmony
in the aryan dawnTwist the cunt with brutality
Insert your fingers into the body
Her skull become squashed
Insert the TNT inside her asshole
Pull the eyeballs out
Stamp the arsewith a hot iron bar
Hoyda...
Fire the dynamite with pleasure
Her binded arms and legs shake with fear
And her cries can only give you more and more plasure(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Blizzards and ice, the power of north 
silent and lethal, a death-payed toll 
we strive for a shelter, in the eye of the storm 
but hardly we find the strength to go on 

Weeks have gone by since we last saw the sun 
our struggle is painful, with blood in our hands 
but fire lies deep into our hearts 
nothing can't stop the wish of a god 

Dive into the dreadful night 
shattered by the piercing ice 
will we find our way through the snow? 
May the Norns guide us home 

The howls of the wild are calling for bait 
while we are running a race against death 
night-wandering shadows painted by the bright moon 
can only be a path to follow by fools 

The ravens and wolves bring shivers to the flesh 
painting the loneliness deep into ourselves 
recalling the deepest pain a man can feel 
but the harder the journey, the stronger the will 

(CHORUS x2) 
Light from the stars, please lead on our way 
as we carry the torch of the undying flame 
cleanse our souls, let the It has all come to an end, 
Everything and nothing all in one, 
All that is seen, turned to dust, 
This entire world around me, 

It all turns to Zero, 
It all begins again, 
Destroyed and made anew, 
The past becomes the future, 

Everything has changed, 
Nothing is the same, 
All have gone away, 
Nothing else remains, 

It all turns to zero, 
It all Turns to zero.Like a demon that shows it's face
No longer in the shadow of the sun
Out from the hiding place
Comes the night's progeny, the nocturnal son

Heavenly sights are obscured
By the shadow with the nocturnal wings
Broadens from a skyline to another
And awake the infernal things
With black dragon wings

It force the sun behind the hills
Whatever it is which darken the sphere
It has an infernal appearance
It gives rise to the human mind's fear
It touch your dreams with evil hands

Fear the dark full of spells
You never know what's coming to you
Maybe it is for you these chiming bells
Maybe you never make it through

It seems endless the night
When it does it's diabolical rise
From the twilight comes the seed from the moon
To give birth to the night and the things it brings

Dark emotions and thoughts
Comes with the moon seed
Pure evil seed which cause the mad man's mind
The demon lord has shown his face
And now it's time to gather the wings
The sun is rising and it's not enough space
For the night's demons and sun's shiningThere is fire in its glance

There is odium in its insides

Mystic power!

Blood! It is the perfect evidence of horror

Deaths! Physical evidence of atrocious battle

The cup is raised, seal of honor

Words of fire that brake rocks

Acquired promise by odium or defense will cause the mystic, ancestral warrior to awaken

Faces that groan for clemency while warriors demonstrate their strength in mortal wars

Fire! The tremor is heard throughout the times

Empires!

Man crushes man for its desires

Others driven by hatred, by dementia

While in history lethal outcomes occur

The arrow is shot, the sword is raised

The shadows behind your back envelop you

In that moment, the cause does not matter

Although you are dead, you are alive inside

It is strange power that surges in my insides

Mystic power!

There is fire in my glance

There is strength in my insides

I fight in the camps of battle

Without fear of death. Death!

Without fear to spill my blood

Font to front, blood

Blood!Denier

Thy great hour 
Has come 

Behold the great cleansing 
Revolving of all meaning 

Undoubtfully there are 
Grand schemes at work; 
And life is without avail 
As are all efforts 

Behold 
Suffering, death, 
Decay, recurrence 
Eternally... 

Behold 
The revolving act of matter 
Behold 
Perpetualness manifests at last 

Behold the great cleansing 
Revolving of all meaning(Instrumental)Vokol noci, prapor snov,
vztyceny smeckou, silou, jednotou
Jedinym pohladom ocami vlkov,
padnu tiene duse, ohnom i ocistou

Ocami vlkov, perami havranov,
jedinou silou, chutou krvi spojenou
Riekou mrazu, stranami snov.
Bojom! Nie zezlom slov!

Uprostred vone lesa, v tichu samoty,
kolobehom svetla mdleho ci temnoty,
Sta posledna korist budu hnani do nory,
krvou za krv, hladom po boji.

V smecke vlkov, chraneni nocnou hmlou

Riekou smrti, dialami potokov

a dream of the christ's defeat
the dark horde have conquered
The christians burn in fire below the fullmoon shining in a cold winternight
The Christians certain death
our time is here
A bestial bloodwar...
We chase the Christians as the mighty wolf of the deep forest
Chase and drown their victims in blood
We chop them to pieces with swords tempered in blood
We let the blood flow to the ground
In the night can we hear the raven sing its song about the certain fall of christians
We kneel and worship our master and pay the homage to the eternal night.Sirens of war, massacre to begin
no negotiations, no retreat
armies are marching, death to arrive
existence is threatened, few to survive

Unleash the storm - All life's ignored
Unleash the storm - breed total war

Countless soldiers to fill countless graves
cities in ashes, perished in flames
horror and despair, fear to last
uncertain future, cursed is the past

Unleash the storm - All life's ignored
Unleash the storm - breed total warAll these gorgeous dreams seem to disappear in emptiness
Intentionally forgotten
swallowed by the pace of time.
Life has dealt so many forms of bravery and amenity
as beauty only can have.
We enjoyed it, fulfilled like no one else.
What else can there be...
What else shout there be...
All the fighting may seem in vain...

Oh, small benighted mortals
all that you held important will vanish in nothingness
A day will come when there is no dawn
with growing darkness, this futile world will be veiled in deepest blackness.

If you cannot start with yourself, destroy all that you can
album covers(Instrumental)Look the time stopped here 
Listen sound of decay
Feel the empty space 
Left for ruination

This place rotting 
This place dying 
No light shining 
It's time to 
Disorganize 
Disharmonize

Progress made its end
Time to descend
To disorganize
To disharmonize

Another time, another place 
For inbreeding human race 
Another world, another space 
While its heritage in disgrace

See the dead machines 
Tools are disarrayed 
They are dream of past 
Where the mankind stayed

This place rotting 
This place dying 
No light shining 
It's time to 
Disorganize 
DisharmonizeLiving... a lie
Waste your money... or die
Your existence... is useless
If freedom... is denied

We're tired of being in the society we live
Surrounded  by people that don't wake up and see
That we have been exploited by the supremacy
That lives among us, feeds from us without equality

Living... a lie
Waste your money... or die
Your existence... is useless
If freedom... is denied

Let's break from our oppression, let the masses arise
We have the right to lead the fight for victory is nigh
For those who stand against us, a bloody fate awaits
So stand aside or be prepared to face our raging hate

Living... a lie
Waste your money... or die
Your existence... is useless
If freedom... is denied(Instrumental)One single day of courage and pride,
Today, the horde of braves
After great bloody strife
Had another day spilling blood.
Condemning all the slaves of the cross
To the mighty power of the Hammer.
The heroic battlefield 
Was transformed in fire.

Where, under the sign of the hammer,
The mighty barbaric pagan horde
Meet great victory, once more.
To the Hammer of the Braves
We won! To honor Tyr!Autumn falls
We sail across the sea
Our passion bleeds
Tears our hearts apart
Insidious streams
Thoughts that poison minds
Eyes filled with fear
Watch us from the depths

Rivalry of burning souls
Colossal rains will drown them all
Season of the darkening days
Turning to the loss of last sun's ray
Winter fell
Remember days that have gone
Hollow stare into the fading sun
False course
No land, no truth, no hope
Cold inside
The sea beast all over us

Rivalry of burning souls
Colossal rains will drown them all
Season of the darkening days
Turning to the loss of last sun's ray
Still winter
No signs of safety home
Still winter
Ice cold water reigns

Rivalry of burning souls
Colossal rains will drown them all
Season of the darkening days
Turning to the loss of last sun's ray
Fields of desolation
A burial ground
He who needs perfection,
O, let him in!Blazing torch of great pioneer 
Untimely burnt out at age 38 
Hymns that immortalizer thy legacy 
Inexhaustable spring of inspiration 

I let it flow sincerely from the heart 
As I tumble the steps you once walked 
Humbly admitting to myself 
I shall never reach the heights of thy splendor 

Let my candle ablaze a furor fire 
With no smoldering embers left behind 
Let the twilight hour grant me the peace 
This life was unable to bring 
Let there be no regrets - no stones unturned 
When my ashes scatters on the north wind 

"The sound of thunder, of wind and of rain 
Made way for the one who rode to Asa bay" 

Let my candle ablaze a furor fire 
With no smoldering embers left behind 
Let there be no regrets - no stones unturned 
When our spirits rejoice in the great halls......I observes from under

I observe the extreme consequence
of the ignorance;
that that converted
the existence of races that;
from their bud they possessed the virtues of all human.

I observe the virtues to be exterminated
together with the instincts to disappear
and the man succumbs blindly with stupidity...

...I observes under.

One after other unworthy of life submerges
in that prophetic excrement with their god on the black receive the punishment
which rewards divine
and they surrender surrounded cult of baseness.

I rise in light; full with having ennobled solemnity evolving my to exist
inside this majestic empire
which waits for you...

... observante under.In the misty darkness of my
dreams
I wander through the fields
The fields of blood and agony -
where so many had to yield

Through all the ages
Through all the struggle for life
Against bondage, oppression
For freedom and hope
With the hopeless ideal to
survive

This is a tribute
to all the heathens who died
Tortured, enslaved and burnt
to death
by the servants of religious lies

religious lies

I hear their mourning in my head
the pain and misery
Betrayed and slaughtered
they were damned
to this place without relief
And all the slain they look at me
with widley opened eyes
Their faces are distorted masks
congealed in silent cries

do not believe
Do not obey to their priests
Who want to control you
and spit on your roots
to justify their bloody deeds

This is a tribute
to all the heathens who died
Tortured, enslaved and burnt
to death
by the servants of religious lies

May their spirit rise again
to enlighten me
And to bring back the lores
got lost in dark centuries
May their ghosts rise again
just to frighten those
Who dare to convert innocence
by force

And their spirit
Spirit shall rise again
haunt them - to take revenge

Cleanse the world
and then rebuilt
the mighty heathen throne
Cleanse the world
and then rebuilt
the mighty heathen throne
And for all ages we will live
in freedom and in peace
The heathen rise will
freei our souls from grief

May their spirit rise again
to enlighten me
And to bring back the lores
got lost in dark centuries
May their ghosts rise again
just to frighten those
Who dare to convert innocence
by force

do not believe
Do not obey to their priests
Who want to control you
and spit on your roots
to justify their bloody deeds

This is a tribute
to all the heathens who died
Tortured, enslaved and burnt
to death
by the servants of religious lies

May their spirit rise again
And to bring back the loresEverything here is so cold
Everything here is so dark
I remember it as from a dream
In the corner of this time
Diabolic shapes float by
Out from the dark
I remember it was here I died
By following the freezing moon
It's night again
Night you beautiful
I please my hunger
On living humans
Night of hunger
Follow it's call
Follow the freezing moon
Darkness is growing
The eternity opens
The cemetery lights up again
As in ancient times
Fallen souls die behind my steps
By following the freezing moonThe destiny of gods 
Gods and demons 
The big ending battle 
Fight and evilness last in three years 
Skoll swallows the sun 
Hate swallows the moon 
Blood squirts all over the sky 
An extreme cold 
Fimbulwinter in three years 
Loke and Fenris tear lose 
Midgardsormen search towards land 
It was Naglefar to land 
Heimdal blows his horn the battle has began 
Holy and demonic powers 
Are in battle 
Surt sling fire over earth 
A new world shows up 
It is the age of Ragnarok 
A age in darkness 
Hordes from the dark side 
Gather to the battle of the end earth.Big money business

Racial power keeps minorities down
who died and made them God
If they want an apartheid state
then take your shit and fuck off(Instrumental)(Instrumental)In my dreams I see my fate
Life is taken from me
Thus there was an oath from all
Never to harm Baldr
But one was too young to take this oath...

Take this bow as I guide your aim,
Even the blind may honour their kin...
Thus was the bane of the beautiful God
There was much despair
That deed began the end of things..

"With such a fell time we are faced
One is to blame for what has become
Soon he will face a terrible vengeance
For all that he has done...
Grief overwhelms, the end of all things
Is now at hand as envy subsides
One must ride the road to Hel
If we are to see the fallen son again...

Odin's son Hermod the Bold
Will ride as the wind
To the second son
Now prepared is a funeral pyre
To send forth all that was
Nine dark nights, the ride to Hel
Comes he to the hall at last

"O! Hel,I beg of thee,
By the tears of the Aesir
That you may let me brother ride
With me back to his home
By guile was he taken from here..."

"This I say, if all will weep
Then I shall let your brother leave".
Thus it was spoken that all things
Shed their tears in his name
But there was one that would not weep...

"Thokk will weep
dry tears at Baldr's funeral pyre
Alive or dead the old man's
son gave me no joy.
Let Hel hold what she has"

Deceiver, no shape or hide
Can spare you from revenge
You tread your fatal and final path
No mercy will you be shown

In this cave your evil is bound

Bound by your own son's
Guts you shall remain
Underneath the poison
Forever you will lie
But come will the day
When bonds will break...THE BATTLELORE

I have looked across the valley it had been a hard fight
But it was over now and I am wounded
But happy for a great victory had been achieved
I remember how close the enemy had come 
How close to loosing my live. Death seemed constantly
In my shoulder waiting but not coming for me yet

We had the victory, but it had cost them dear
My spirit still strong fighting by our own lands
Many good men would not be returning
To their home tonight
The memories from the past come to my mind
Remember this fight and the years behind
I must guarantee thet the victory
Forever shall be ours

Come, brave warriors to the poet's tale
We hail the brave men
The ancient heroes, valorous
Come, brave warriors 
Your sword shall be celebrated tonight
We hail you
And now our land shall will remain free

After some time, the celebration started
And the songs was sung
For the fallen warriors
For those that fought that day

After the celebration, comes the storm
And I see a new battle that will come
Let's be prepared

The sound of hammer on anvil already start
Soon, the sound of weapon on shield will be heard
Echoing through the vale
And the warriors honing their fighting skills 
Let's kill the christian
Turning they into food
Of the wolves and ravens
And one more death will be waiting in my way
And I still defending
My land and the folk.Instumental(Instrumental)Leave all the good things back and, now, know who I really am. See in my eyes all the pain and hatred. Believe in what I am, and not in what I was. I sadly removed all my inner scars And all the real ones are visible and real. I'm not the one who used to find. I'm not the one who used to love. It's funny to say but I'm a fool, a completely wicked being, wrongly man. You will know pain and hatred with me. So run away, far from my fucking self. It's time to search for something better for you. Leave your memories behind, mine are erased. I choose to be what I am And I choose to be doomed and alone

Leave your memories behind, mine are erased. I choose to be what I am And I choose to be doomed and alone

I used to be real and... I fall in a suite of "rise and fall". If only I'd lost you.

I am not... anymore
I am not... anymore

Let me die. Let me die. Get the fuck away. This life coming up, and I can't take no more. My feet off the ground. And I will pray. Way. Let me die. Fuck you. And let me die.

My memories are erased. I am not.
My memories are erased. I am not.(Instrumental)Gaze descends into fire
Vile the actions impure
How brittle are words
And what may one endure

Break all scriptures and ties
Yield to what will commands
Burn the past beliefs
And follow what flesh demands

Gathering voices defy me
Unbind us from the tales

Blaspheming deeds define me
Unbind us from the graves

Stay under the blazing leaves
Wait for colours to wither
And all light to flee
Trees wearing white
Even the stone will freeze

Does treason rest one-sided
When past festers the wounds
And both rot divided

Inside the common tomb
Arrival to the edge of dreams
Shed light without warmth brought
On emptied halls, reaped fields
This is all
All what you sought

With strength of mortal will
I walk into fire
From world grey with sorrow
I walk into fireScream for Odin
Raise your swords
Board the ships we are heading North

Bold! I laugh when death is near
Fortune favors the brave
Glory is to live without fear
Flying high the ravens will see Asgaard prevail
Steel can be trusted - Hammers never lie, never fail

Strike like thunder
The last man standing will be me

Kill me if you can

Strike like thunder
The last man standing will be me

Kill me if you can

The cold wind blows on my face
As silent as the dead whatever lies ahead
I do not fear

Flying high the ravens will see Asgaard prevail
Steel can be trusted - Hammers never lie, never fail

Another journey will begin
The berserkers are gathering
The air is cold, a good day to kill
Rain will fall, blood will be spilled
Hel awaits but not for me
She will open her gates for my enemy

Kill me if you canFar away from home
I roam these lands and distant shores
Damned - Forsaken - Banned - Cast out
A pariah of war
All I held so dear I had to burn and leave behind
A solitary man who's the run into exile

No - Never again I'll see the faces of my kin
But all their faces are engraved & locked so deep within
All I had so easily taken away from me
But no you'll never take away these treasured memories

I'm free - I'm free - Yes - I'm free

Forever banned into exile eternal - Exile eternal
Forever banned - Banned into exile

Come - Oh dreaded foe - Follow the trails of my escape
Send all your dogs of war
to catch my scent and seal my fate
I will not rest - I'll lead you beasts away into the wild
You may catch me - You'll hunt me down
but not my wife and child

Some they called me golden tongue
For I gave generously of my private means
I founded hospitals for the poor
A social being - Not a religious activist
I spoke out fearlessly against the custom of bowing
before their statues
For this defiance of authority I was banned into exile(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Charging into destruction
With help from Hades
Sacrificing seduction
For violence and tragedy
Led into trash
Crawl out from doom
Bang hard for you
Slashing demonic assault
Whiplash disaster
Slaughtered till you're senseless
Commands are carried out
We'll leave you defenseless
Chosen ones will be hellbound
Raising the dead for one last rite
Shouting deathyells are hellish tonight
Hell is tonight
Forced to end in all chaos
Sabotaged ritual
There was no one to slay us
Dragged down into hellWhen the shades of death glide over your hearts
And when believes become a force
You swear allegiance to idols

I am the godless, forsaken child from grace

Blinded by your cults and lost in your rites
You sink in a shadowed age
You are fools, perverted by your fears

Following the will of gods, you creep in lies and ignorance

When the gleam of dawn appears to my sight
And when landscapes invade my heart
I swear allegiance to nature
I am the godless, the son of Mother Earth

Banished from our lands, rejected by clans
Betrayed by my will of truth
I am the wise, disciple of knowledge

Wandering from plains to crests to learn the mysteries of our world

Sadness, lonesome, creeping as forlorn exile
Persecuted, martyr, I have to hide

In cold shades of my own terror
Dying in this rising solitude
Darkness is grabbing my soul
Crying in the lack of understanding
Madness!

Through these grim shadows, my soul revealed itself
In a world of faith, hatred will prevail

Through these grim shadows my soul has drown in pain
In the court of gods I will die in silenceI lived in empty space, without meaning, without grace
Disappointed from reality
Death looked to be the last chance
To escape from my past
From solitude and destiny
At last I saw her face
And she gave me hope in pain, returned from insanity
I entered another world, without fear
Was I burned?
Her love seemed like infinity

A knife of pain impaled my soul
I believed your poison love
Will I find a reason for your treason?
Which always returns to me

Love is so blind
Here is the truth
Look for my heart
It is bleeding for you
Love is so blind
It hurts me so deep
Scars on the inside
Will never complete

Everything I once held dear
I cannot find anywhere
You broke me and my purity
Where are the plans we made?
Where is the time that's gone away?
Was it only deception?
I won't waste another day
By searching if you played a game of love
Was it vanity?

I remember when you said
I will stand by you, my dear
It was only cunningness

A knife of pain impaled my soul
I believed your poison love
Will I find a reason for your treason?
Which always returns to me

Love is so blind
Here is the truth
Look for my heart
It is bleeding for you
Love is so blind
It hurts me so deep
Scars on the inside
Will never complete

I am in misery but my spirit feels strong
This is my mystery when I'm growing up alone
Where is my hope?
I'll be there when you bring me new dayWaldeinsamkeit
Die mich erfreut,
So morgen wie heut
In ew'ger Zeit,
O wie mich freut
Waldeinsamkeit.

Waldeinsamkeit
Wie liegst du weit!
O dich gereut
Einst mit der Zeit. -
Ach einz'ge freud
Waldeinsamkeit.

Waldeinsamkeit
Mich wieder freut,
Mir geschieht kein Leid,
Hier wohnt kein Neid,
Von neuem mich freut
Waldeinsamkeit.Shades of the past are reviving
Rising the cross of hatred
Reborn from the evil's ashes
Are teaching the lie
Dressed in black
are coming to crash you
Different faith? {{INTO THE FIRE}}
They give you a chance:
the church or the hangman,
But you have to live
Chorus:
Holy gates are closed behind you
hidin' inside dirty laws
Turn the page
that's written by a false mind
In the name of Rose
How many great minds are wasted?
Been accused by wizards wrongly,
Replacing the dreams to nightmares
And smiles to paincity besieged
family in fear
he guides the army
in a hopeless war

Helenics at the gates
heroes will fight
Hektor stands brave
in front of Troy

to defend his home
Hektor would die
he wins every duel
even in death

the soldiers light
in the first line
there comes Achilles
the battle begins

defender fell
corpse dishonoured
gods protect it
he was a true hero

to defend his people
Hektor died
he gave his life
for his wifeThis is my world, this is my Holy war
Word is no more, and all I hear is roar
My will is strong, I am in fire glow
The armor-clad machine, I head for what I need
I am the type with fire in the skies
This land is mine, attack is on my mind
I roar and shine, I'm rushing into fight
I leave my severe home; I roll out on my own

I am the law, I am the Iron Claw
I see my world, it is black and white I know
I beat my track with fire and the sword
In battlefield my home, I die where I was born
I am the thing, the real war machine
Steel is my skin, the battle in dream
I beat my track, It is only way to win
The only way I know, the never ending war

Roll out
Roll out
Roll out
Roll out(Instrumental)The night shuddered and wept. It's black tears all consuming. A howling wind bombards the trees. Lost within the glow of the moon. Fear sub-sides and hate overwhelms. The true taste of the dark. Surrounded by evil. Thoughts fall to actions. Flames sore through the night. It screams in horrible pleasure. The transformed warrior. Cries in triumph. The gods have awaken. Odin, All-father. Empower your followers. Basnish all who worship the cross. Destroy those who oppose us. Let the darkness ride again. Let the night sigh once more. I am the one true power. I am here.The mass is over the night is done
Time to reap our rewards
The stench is sweet the burning lust
Brought forth by our Lord
Heat is rising souls are dying
By Lucifer's sword
Ride to hell your Lord has fell
Ride to Hell... on the wings of Satan
Now I am free from mortal chains
Forever living in sin
Taking chances with destiny
The only way you'll win
Mayhem, torture, darkness and pain
Let the Holocaust begin(Instrumental)Razkrestje

Kad izdahnu iza brda vatra nadzemaljska
Zora jedna bese oplakana
Jos u suton,smiraj dana,pre Meseca
Tmurnog neba gospodara,jos pre zvezda,
Okrutnih sudjaja,stop o mraku sudbu kroje,
Avetima nocnim utrobu sto poje.

Srebrni me bodez kraj putanje ceka,
Vratim li se ziv u slavi,sjajno ce da sija
Nestanem li s' Jave,od vlage ce da rdja.

Majci svojoj zariven u nedra
Do nestanka sveta na me da se seca
Kovaca svog sto iskova mnogo smrti
A sad njemu smrt kuju!

Sudjaje me levom stranom gurale
Polu-mrtve kucke s' tropuca meni su kukale
Uplakane deve zamnom slamu su bacale,
Crnu dusu moju nebil' ukrotile!

Cetres' dana mrtva dusa na prokletiji spava,
Cetres' mi dana s' duse krvari rana-
Smrti pospesi!
Izvidaj me I resi
Ovog uzasnog bola I zivota!

Doletite orli I gavrani,
I mojim se nasladite mesom,
Dok pogledom svojim ja streljam nebesa!
S' vrha brda na kom stoji
Kamen stolovan,
Kraj koga je bistra voda vecna,
Iz koje mi preti odraz moj,
Da tu sm(Instrumental)Blood spills out the carotid speckling on the foul floor
Can see the slipping of the flesh from the bones
body looks like an acranius with nails in its abdomen
nobody's bothered by his wrecked little head
nobody gives a damn about his weakly decomposing life
he's just a pure imagination of the blinded menMemoriae meae

Erat eques equitaus

Tempestas imminens erat
Odor mortis in aere uagabat

Lucus niger se horizonten dilatabat
Secretum ensis erat clavis

Lost in despair
The anguish has a face

Praying for normal
Praying for life
Or choose the knife(Instrumental)Melting bodies lying on the floor 
Acid falls from the sky 
Toxic waste floods the streets 
People slowly die 
Radiation fills your lungs 
As you burn from inside 
Try to escape no where to run 
November where to hide 

Burning buildings collapse to the ground 
People scatter in fear 
Atomic clouds fill the sky 
Screams is all you hear 
Magma burns trough your skin 
Your eyes fill with tears 
Population starts to fall 
End of mankind is near

Death...corruption...chaos..

DEATH!  CORRUPTION! CHAOS! 
TOXIC PLAGUEEight hoof falls sound across Midgard, heralding his passing,
The hanged one, all father of the Asagods
Eternal all seeing one eyed wanderer,
On Sleipnir into battle he rides.
 
Odin, Allfather,
Most Ancient of the gods,
Odin, Allfather,
Ruler of the nine worlds
 
Pierced to Yggdrasil and yet still unbowed
Lord of men and the victorious dead
The Einherjar in Valhalla watch as
On sleipnir into battle he rides,
 
Odin, Allfather,
Most Ancient of the gods,
Odin, Allfather,
Ruler of the nine worlds(Instrumental)Alone and silent
I feel the chilling air
The storm blows violent
The gale wind whips my hair

The darksome night my friend in need
Black blood of anguish my heart shall bleed
Spite and disdain freeze my mind
I feel just scorn for my own kind
There's just hatred - no more love
And as I'm lifting up my head
I hear no laughter from above
Heaven's cold and god is dead

Feel my longing to destroy
All God's creation, it shall fall apart
Share my hatred and enjoy
Hear the reflections of my black-seared heart

By freezing moonlight I watch the skies
Pale stars are gleaming in my cold eyes

When our weak mankind will soon be dead and gone
You'll hear my final howl of triumph

Feel my longing to destroy
All God's creation, it shall fall apart
Share my hatred and enjoy
Hear the reflections of my black-seared heartOmens of the crescent moon
For a dark breed born by separation

Inbred Athanor coagulates
Eucharistical spawn
From beyond the abyss
A double carved in Qliphoth
Martial current awaken

Karmic laws suspended
In terrific proclamation
I'm Kronos, I'm the perfect cycle
I am the axis of your lust

Omens of the crescent moon
Four is the number to observe
Martial energies embodied
