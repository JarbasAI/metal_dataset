"No Gods in the Skies!" the Brave Men Lamented. They Were Then Called Forth, and Cursed Upon.
...and in the Sea of Starry Night, the Awful Haint Haunted Them So.
But All That Remained of the Mad Wizard Was Glass on the Floor.
Goddamn This Enemy! And the Machines That They Ride into War!
Long We Awaited the Wizard. The Sorcerer Spoke. The Ship Ascended
Sewn in Sailcloth, They Grieved for Him. And So, the Navigator Was Buried at Sea.
